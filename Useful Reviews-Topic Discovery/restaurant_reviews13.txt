Restaurant name  Red's Bar & Grill

Review Text :
***Red's is a surprisingly good breakfast and lunch spot for a resort hotel***Red's Bar & Grill is the casual restaurant and bar next to the golf course at the Wigwam--a hotel, golf, tennis, and spa resort near Phoenix.  I tend to avoid resort restaurants, but I was at this resort without a car so I gave this resort's casual restaurant a try for breakfast and lunch.I tried them first for lunch.  They recently revamped their menu and it offers a mix of casual and not too expensive gastropub lunchtime fare--hearty starters and a collection of sandwiches including a few burgers.  I started with the bacon and beer cheese dip with pretzel bites.  The warm cheese dip was good as it had a good salty note as well as a smoky flavor from the bacon.  The cheese dip was creamy and had a thickness without being overly heavy or rich.  The dip was topped with green onions, which provided sharpness.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/reds-bar-and-grill-litchfield-park-2?select=UUZHGUneB7XP1Y9v0CWd4A#9w-QtLsLe_BVUhOMchrv1AThe pretzel bites were warm, buttery and not too salty.  They varied in quality though.  Some were too small and kind of hard while others had a nice light and soft quality to them.For my entree, I had the Southern Bird, which was a satisfying turkey burger.  What made the turkey burger shine the most were the garnishes.  The lettuce and tomato were both fresh.  I also enjoyed the lightly sweet but also slightly spicy BBQ sauce.  The fried pickles provided an indulgent crunch and fried component to the burger as well as a little bit of tanginess from the pickles.  There was also melted cheese though I do not think cheese always works with turkey burgers.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/reds-bar-and-grill-litchfield-park-2?select=UUZHGUneB7XP1Y9v0CWd4A#80b_lNUkJCOLHODY-2r8oAThe turkey patty itself was slightly moist though definitely not as moist as an expertly prepared medium rare burger patty.  The turkey patty though had a good amount of flavor due to the aggressive seasoning of it.  The burger sat on a fresh whole wheat bun.  The bun provided a sturdy structure for the burger and all of the toppings so it could be eaten as a sandwich and not something with a knife and fork.The burger came with fries and they were excellent--hot and crisp on the outside but still soft on the inside.Dessert was disappointing.  I had dessert flautas, which were fried pastries filled with brownies, nuts and marshmallows.  The flautas were paired with vanilla ice cream and whipped cream.  The brownie flavor was decent and it was nice to have a warm dessert.  This was supposed to a rocky road-like experience, but the flavor of the nuts and marshmallow were not really there.  In addition, the flauta pastry was not crispy enough (it was actually quite soft and almost burrito tortilla-like).I also tried Red's for breakfast and had their Southwest Loco Moco, which was Sonoran rice mixed with chorizo and ranchero sauce.  The rice mixture was topped with poached eggs, cotija cheese and sour cream.  The flavors were all delicious.  The poached eggs were nicely done so that the yolk provided a thick and creamy sauce for the dish.  The chorizo was moist and meaty.  The rice was cooked to the right texture and all of the sauces and creams and chorizo combined to provide a spicy and savory breakfast dish.There were a few areas where it could have been better though.  The dish was very soft.  Loco moco is too, but I think I would have preferred some crispy and crunchy textures here to provide variety to the hearty and comforting dish.  In addition, the temperature was a little uneven as some elements were hot while other ingredients (like parts of the rice) were lukewarm to even slightly cold.The dining room at Red's works.  It is comfortable and suitable for various party sizes.  It is also casual while still having a slightly upscale feel making it a good contemporary gastropub option.  If you sit outside, you get nice views of the golf course.I found the service to be very personable and friendly.  I also felt the food came out at a quick pace.  The waitstaff did not check in as much as other places I have been to and I think this was due to the shortage of staff.  I did not think it impacted the experience that much though I did witness one very unhappy couple who seemed to have longer than expected wait times for food and service.Prices were reasonable.  Portions are generous and you do not have to pay the ridiculous prices that you often have to pay at a resort or even just a hotel for that matter.Overall, I liked Red's.  The food would not compete against top gastropubs I have been to across the country.  But for the area, I felt the flavors and quality of their food would probably be above most of their nearby competition.  If you are staying at this resort or playing golf, I think Red's is a satisfying option for breakfast or lunch.I believe free parking is available.

Two pitchers of sangria later, I approve.Seriously though, this is clearly a family run joint where the father is in the kitchen and the children are working the front of house. That, plus food which was far more authentic than I expected (umm, cactus garnish?) makes for a small business that really deserves to be rated favorably. Was everything a home run? No, not really... but it was still better than every other Americanized Mexican joint I've been to in the States. Whatever you are doing Restaurant El Meson, please don't stop. Merci.

No.  No.  A thousand times no.  Guy Fieri owes me 30 bucks and the hour I completely wasted on one of the worst dining experiences I've had in years.  (Yeah, yeah.)First of all, this place is a hole.  I don't mind holes as a general rule, but Crystal on Penn takes  it to a "hole" new level.  It's Dante's circle of hell reserved for compulsive cleaners, fans of sanitation and neat freaks.  It's dirrrrrrty, know'm'sayin'?Second, the service.  It's bizarre.  Servers who holler across the bar at each other and patrons and sing along to the radio at the top of their lungs.  Friendly, but not professional in the slightest.Lastly, the food.  It's awful, and about as "Mediterranean" as raggae.  The sampler appetizer was described to us by the server as "a sampling of all our best appetizers, accompanied by fresh, warm pita."  Dolmades were dry and bland, hummus was boring, tabbouleh was all parsley and the olives were canned California olives.  "Fresh" and "warm" translated to "chewy" and "room temp" for the pita.  Icing on the cake: the plastic, divided server like the pre-cut veggie platters at the grocery store.The falafel sandwich -- touted by our server as featured by Guy on "Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives" -- had an extremely odd aftertaste and was served as crumbles instead of patties.  Husband's gyro salad was completely uninspired, sprinkled with griddled flakes of lamb gyro.  Griddling the gyro meat rendered it crunchy.  Most of each meal was left behind on the plate.Just.  No.[15 Minutes of Fame: "Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives: A Taste of Everywhere"]

Decarie Hot Dog is a Montreal institution. If you have a craving for comfort food... this is the place to go.... AAAAAND it's always open.The esthetic of the place and neighborhood look somewhat shady as well as dirty but it can be worth your time to quickly come here to eat anyways. The place is literally this tiny hole in the wall, easy to miss with very limited seating and it can get pretty busy.I've been here many times in my life without issues to have their "Lafleur" steamies. Hot Dog Decarie prepares them quickly and so dirt cheap you can easily buy more. And why not??? These dogs go down nicely and are delish!My favorite though is their popular poutine. It's a 'notch below excellent' and is unlike many places that do serve poutine, it's consistently as good each visit. Huge portion, the fries are just right, generous with the extra squeaky cheese curds and the gravy goodness is damn solid folks. All for a mere $5. Best deal in the city as far as I know.For a mere 10 bucks you'll leave this place with a full HAPPY stomach. What's not to like?

Great view. (insert sounds of crickets chirping here) But that's about it. Bentley's really didn't impress me the other night. When we got there- the hostess asked us to take a seat in the bar as our table wasn't ready. Okay. So we sit in the stylish bar in front of the fireplace and a woman comes over to take our drink order. At that point the hostess came and got us for the table and the server basically never got us our drinks. In most fine dining restaurants- once the drink order is taken, it doesn't matter if you drink them in the bar or the restaurant; they take them to where you are. But not the case here. So we never got that first drink. That was the first service mis step of the night. The rest of the service errors were due to the server who we had (or didn't have, as the case may be, as this guy was missing in action for most of our VERY long dinner). We were celebrating a birthday and had asked for a window table for this occasion. We were seated in the perfect table- right on the edge of the window looking out over downtown Charlotte. This was off to be a great night. Or so I thought. Our server came over with a couple of bottles of champagne to tempt us but we were in the wine and cocktail mood so we passed on the champagne. Maybe that was our mistake as this guy didn't come back to our table to get our drink order for at least 15 minutes. No drinks. No bread refresh. No fresh ground pepper (other tables had it) No service. Where is all this "southern hospitality" that my friends down here talk to me about? Not at Bentley's on this Thursday night, that's for sure. We placed our order. Too bad for me that they didn't have Grouper on this night although it was printed on the menu (my fav) but had instead substituted Mahi Mahi in for it. No thanks. I went with surf and turf with a filet and crab along with a salad to start. My friend ordered escargot to start and this same server tried to talk him out of it saying it would take 20 minutes to prepare. " Hey!", thought I. "The man wants snails . . .give him snails!" Don't try to talk him out of it. So the rest of our appetizers came up with the snails and were quite good. There might have been a pacing problem in the kitchen as our entrees then took forever to come out. And when they did, other than the sides coming out piece meal, the food was pretty good- although there was gravy over my filet when I had ordered it with Bearnaise sauce. Also-there were only 2 melted butters brought out to the table- when clearly 3 of us were having lobster or crab. At this point- our dinner was going on the 2.5 hour point and we were meeting others and had to go. However- we knew there was a special birthday dessert coming out but again . . .it was taking forever. When it finally came out, we had a forkful and then practically ran out of the door. Dinner for 4 ran about $400 which would have been reasonable for a fine dining restaurant, had we gotten a fine dining experience. An off night? I don't know. This server really blew it. And at that price? I am sure there are better choices in Charlotte.One undeniable fact about Bentley's is of course, the the grand view and ambiance. If you get seated next to the window (and please ask for a window seat), you won' t be disappointed. They will seat next to each other to be romanced by Uptown's mesmorizing skyline. When we get to the food and service though, slightly unimpressive.The Valentines day experience had the prefix dinner and a classy lounge band singing some classic slow dance tunes that all age groups would appreciate. When we get down to food and service, I can't really say I was courted ever so eloquently. While the food and service was A-okay, truth be told, they really aren't up to par in comparison to the prime real estate.Went here on date-night, and the place was oh so romantic. I give the food 3-stars, but the ambiance deserves a star all on its own. What can I say, I like my food messy and ethnic. Bentley's food is pretty and rich. We ordered the crabcake for appetizers, I ordered the Taste of Hawaii, which was fresh sea bass that night, and my man ordered a steak. The presentation was lovely, and the service was superb. Think Anthony Hopkins in Remains of the Day. We had the best view in the house in my opinion, facing the city skyline. We got there at 8 p.m. and by the middle of our dinner, we saw the sun set.

Review Text :
Michelin one star?  Me thinks not.Any star from the Michelin Guide denotes a restaurant that delivers an unparalleled dining experience.  From the sophistication of the food, its presentation, setting and service.  All should be near flawless and representative of the culture.The Kitchin prides itself on outstanding sourcing of ingredients but combined in a way that makes none stand out.  Perhaps it is the intended goal, but having tried numerous "regular" eateries in Scotland prior to the Michelin meal, I never experienced blended flavors.  Don't get me wrong, the food is plenty good just uncharacteristic of a restaurants so dedicated to ingredients. The meal opens with an assortment of crisp flat bread wafers with a creamy bleu cheese dip.  Some with laver, others with squid ink.  A fun opening act.The prestarter, a small serving of seafood veloute with raw root veg and bright acidity ready's the palate for more.To the starters.  Gigas oysters prepared six ways.  Raw, outstanding and showcasing the incredible clean flavor.  Cooked as a Rockefeller, smoked, cut up and mixed with root veg, in a Asian sauce, etc were good on their own but the subtle goodness of the oyster is lost.  A hand dived Orkney scallop baked in shell with white wine, vermouth and a wild herb, butter sauce, vibrant and sweet.  Steaming keeps the scallop tender.  Somewhat over seasoned.For mains, a very good monkfish tail wrapped in pancetta, served with barely cooked through squid, pan roasted potatoes, foraged mushrooms and scallion with a seaweed sauce.  The Scottish affinity for pairing mushrooms with Seafood continues to impress in its ability to bring out the natural flavors.  The only weakness, the pancetta overpowers the delicate fish.The lobster stuffed with squid, pancetta, assorted squash and braised fennel, and finished with an escargot butter, outstanding.  Incredible sweetness harmonizes perfectly with the anise flavor of the fennel.  The escargot butter's richness and slight earthiness adds incredible back flavors and surprising umame.  Incredible. The only true mistake, the lobster "risotto".  Sweet, perfectly cooked lobster claw and tail served in a "risotto" of potato in a VERY salty seafood broth.  Impossible to eat.  Dish sent back and a replacement, simple, off the menu lobster dish replaced it.A richly flavored pistachio soufflé with chocolate ganache and chocolate chip ice cream, whisky, and petit  fours rounds out the meal.Service; German efficiency.  Never slowing, never stopping.  Friendly but not providing the relaxed atmosphere one expects for a 3 hour meal.The wine list is good but lacks in vintage depth.  Prices are very fair with the average bottle price £100.Overall, reasonable, with dinner for three inclusive of drinks and service, £490.Three month advance booking required.  Credit card to warranty reservation.Somewhat disappointed by the hype.  Eclipsed by the chef's other Michelin eatery, Castle Terrace.

Review Text :
Hit this place originally after reading Eliot Wexler's review in Edible Phoenix. If Eliot likes something, odds are that I'm going to follow right along. Was definitely the case.Was driving by tonight at 1:00 am & just had to stop again. Quick hit for a hot dog with everything - bacon, mayo, beans, tomatoes and onions on a soft bun/roll.  Piled on my condiments of choice, canned mushrooms - lots of them (just got to love the canned mushrooms), guacamole, cheddar, cotija & salsa. Powered down while there, including retopping the dog countless times with my falling condiments. So yummy.Just a great end to a great night.Camelback rd. has established itself as the avenue for gourmet burgers.  Indian School is laying claim to the hot dog.  Between Nogales, Maui Dogs, the regular visits from Short Leash and now Joeys of Chicago, Indian School is fast becoming the defacto hot dog mecca for locals.While not quite as good as the Sonoran dogs in Tucson or even Mexico, this place more than sufficiently satisfies your cravings.  And the fact that it is cash only and in a shady parking lot only heightens the 'South of the Border' like adventure.I've been past this place many nights on my trip between central phoenix and downtown scottsdale, I've heard of the delights to be had, I've desired the bacon wrapping, but I've never actually stopped. That is until now. All the stars aligned this night. I had a hankering for something tasty, I was driving past, it was after everything else closed already - well except for taco bell, but who reall WANTS to eat at taco bell? We ordered up two dogs with all the toppings - well, everything but onions and tomato for me. As exciting as this moment was for me, I couldn't help but compare them to my favorite dog - (ShortLeash). I really think it's unfair to compare everyone to them, but you just can't help it. Pre-short leash this spot may have had high ratings in my book, but I left still hungry after an a-ok dog thinking that next time, I'll just stop at taco bell :-/All in all - not a terrible hot dog, but nothing about it made me want to "write home about it" with exception of their late night hours.Happy Yelping Phoenix!"I've been around this block twice now. Looking for something. A clue. I've been looking for clues and something led me back here. Yeah. So here I am. It could have been me, the one who was at Ringo's place when the shit went down. Hey. I know how it is. I've been there. We've all done bad things. We've all had those guilty feelings in our heart. I'm going to take your brain out of your head and wash it and scrub it and make it clean. I don't know. But I'm going to have to settle this. First we're going to check the grill and see what we can find. We're going to get nice and wet, and you're going to spread your buns. Oh, that's good. So you know me. You know my reputation. Thirteen inches of tough load, I don't treat you gently. That's right. I'm Brock Landers. So I'm going to be nice. So I'm going to be nice. So I'm going to be nice, I'm going to ask you one more time. Where the fuck is Ringo?" Dirk: stands up and looks directly at a massive delicious sonoran dog wrapped in bacon with tomatillo salsa, cotija cheese, creamy guacamole, pico, and mustard. You are a star. You are star, You are a star, You are a star. You are a big, bright, shining star. That's right. "Look, I'm just a Philly guy from out of town that was in town for business for a few days, and happened to have a friend in Phoenix who wanted to show me the best of Phoenix street food.  I'm not one to say no to that proposition.  And I don't know if these Mexican style hot dogs are better than the ones you get in LA or anything like that.  I'm not that savvy when it comes to this style.  But what I will say is this... after trying one of these with guacamole, cheese, and salsa, I wanted to immediately eat two more.  You know what really sold it to me?  The roll.  I've never had such a soft hot dog roll in my life.  And even though it was so soft, it held together like a champ with all of those ingredients on it.  The ladies told me that they get them from a local bakery.  Kudos to that bakery, whomever that is.  I was considering naming this the best hot dog I've ever had after eating it.  Today, I'm not going to be that extreme.  But it's right up there with my favorite places, and it will be a repeat destination for me if I'm ever back in town.Stealing a line from my escort we dined with great fanfare. Where? Venice. Right on the canals. A hotdog after some late night shenanigans hits the spot. These are wonderful hotdogs, perfectly cooked and served on a unique bun. (Uno momento to describe.)I ate two of them.They are works of beauty when delivered to your table. Located outside under a tent in a parking lot a person might just drive by. Very casual. Slow down in your excitement. Your belly will be happy. This food truck offers table service. I found this incredibly charming. Take a seat and someone will be out to offer options.I'm not quite sure which options I inhaled. Like i said, late night, and I hoovered two. Delicious. Bacon, mayo, jalapeños, salsa, beans, maybe some pico? Then I squirted two different green spicy sauces on top. Oh! And sprinkled cheese. (Cheese makes everything better!)The bun is not a potato bun. It was flaky, sweet and buttery. The bun could readily be eaten alone. Slightly warmed with a hint of butter and you'd be ready to go.I'm told Nogales is looking to open a Sushi location *next* door in the near future. Very exciting news. The night we visited I had the good fortune to meet Juan, the owner. Nicest man ever!Please note: Cash only.Yet another to cross off my list of items to try as a new transplant to Arizona. From the bombardment of grilled dogs wafting through the air driving home late at night, Travel Channel airings of the best of Arizona and Instagram drunchie pics- why the hell not?Made it out to Nogales with Kay T. after a Yelp event in the Central Phoenix/Biltmore area and was looking for something substantial to curb our hunger at a late time. Had Nogales on my bookmarks for quite some time and decided to head here.I ordered the Sonoran hotdog that you get here and went topping crazy, when in Rome? Exactly. The hotdog is topped with beans, quac, tomatoes, onion, mayo and I went ahead and topped it with shredded cheese, mushrooms, queso cotija and gave myself a side of pickled jalapeno. Also they had Cerritos, so you know a girl had to grab one ... ended up with the Mandarin one.The bun was so soft and fluffy, wish it was kind of bigger to hold all the toppings and the hot dog. The hot dog was typical- I didn't get a bacon wrapped one, but it was the toppings that took it to the next level. It's pretty much a hot dog with a regional flair! Did I love it? Not as much as I would have thought I would, I guess it left a lot more to be desired. However, that's another thing I got to cross off my list of things to try!They accept cash and card at the cart.

I'd skip it.I mean, it's okay and they are said to have the best antojitos in the city but the place is too dirty for me and no matter how often I have stopped in, I've always preferred the other bars along King St. to this one. They have a big dark patio in their parking lot, and the inside is small and grungy at best. I feel like a bit of a jerk giving this place a bad review after all these great ones but for me, this bar just isn't my thing.

via textChum: Hey, I'm arriving here at one, dinner? drinks? both?Me: Both7 pmChum: Where the hell are you?Me: DowntownChum: Meet us at Ping Pong on SunsetDidn't get a chance to Yelp it, but Chum and his pals liked it so I met up with them.  The place was empty except for a couple.  It was strange...they sat us in the booth right next to them.  Trixie and Antonio come here often and love it.  They also commented that every time they are here, the place is empty.  I asked what about lunch, and they said it's the same.  So a red flag went up and I now wondered if it was any good.  But then again, Chum has dated an assortment of Asian girls so maybe he had better take on this place than I gave him credit for even if he's a vegetarian.I ordered my standard Panang curry with chicken.  Here is where it was a little strange.  This was the first time, I've ordered Thai food with people who didn't opt to share everything.  So I couldn't try Trixie's Pad Thai, although I'm sure she would have if I asked, but I had just met them, so I felt kinda weird.  My dish was very good with just the right amount of heat...I ordered it spicy #2.  I also ordered a Singha beer as well.  Price wasn't so bad...$53 for the four of us.  The portions were generous too.Overall, it was a pleasant dining experience.  We thought that maybe this was a cover for some money laundering thing.  And what's up with the name?  Is ping pong even Thai in origin?  The staff was very nice.  I thought it was funny that the rice took a while to come out.  So I'm not sure if my review is accurate based on one dish.  But it is my favorite and it was very tasty.  I would definitely come back and try more the next time I'm in the area.  I'm in an internet cafe because the wifi is whack at my hotel.If I can tell any of you dear readers two things it is this...people who wear black robes are extremely picky about when you show up...and if you meet one in an alley way behind a bar in Tuscon they will charge 20 dollars extra for things that should be included.That being said my Southwest tour of *******(removed for legal reasons)****has taken my down a long and winding path. So, I am getting ready to see the ****** again and before it was time to go to ***** my ****** said that we need to eat before the **** bargain was going to be announced.I agreed under few conditions...it had to be Thai food and it had to be Thai food on a nice sounding street...AND the restaurant had to have a really stupid name....here comes Ping Pong on East Sunset.  Ping Pong...I did a lot of that while ****** in that horrible ****** and and dreamed about it when i spent 8 months in the hole.  Okay, I can do this. Let's go.  So we went in and I have to say, and it isn't because i have spent most of my life in ****** facilities...but the girls who work as waitresses are all very nice looking. Good beginning.One of these sweet young things sits us down at a table, gives us menus and tells us she will be right back.  I think she will make a great wife number 7.  The lunch menu was complete with all of the standard favorites: pad thai, yellow curry, hot and sour soup, etc. With the pad thai, yellow curry and other dishes you can chose your own meat.After ordering we get a complementary bowl of soup, which was very good. Great coconut milk flavor.  A few minutes later the food came. Very good portion size, and the quality of the food wasn't exceptional but it was good.  For example, I picked the chicken as my meat with the yellow curry and I found two pieces of gristle that should have been cut away before cooking.Another complaint is that I was asked how hot I wanted it, and I like my food spicy so I told her that. Not only was it not that spicy, but all they did was added red pepper flakes as far as I could tell. The broth of the curry was not spicy unless I directly ate a red pepper flake. So it appears to me they do what most places who serve the Anglo's do...they make it mild and they use a cheap way to make it hotter. I am Rex Marvin...I can TELL when you do that.Which is a shame that their prep work was sloppy and their food made too pedestrian for the masses. The other techniques they used were great. The vegetables were cleaned and cut well, they had been properly marinated in the stews and soup, and they took on a great flavor. The hot chicks in great outfits were nice. The portions were good. The price was right.Unfortunately this is the case of exotic cuisine being Americanized to a point of losing what makes it really special.I tried explaining that to the chef, but I am not sure he could understand me with all the screaming and my **** pulling at me and sobbing about all his hard work down the drain. I like to think the chef understood...but all I saw was fear...all I heard was madness. Hope he was able to wash those friggin red pepper flakes out of his eyes by now.From now on if I want Thai's I am either going to this great hooker I know who also does this bead trick that is out of this world...or maybe Archi's. Sure, I had to alley whip some punk last time i was there, and I am banned, but who is going to stop me? I am Rex Marvin. You are not.3 1/2 stars. Brought some clients in for lunch since they picked Ping Pong Thai. This was my first visit here and we arrived before the lunch hour which was a blessing BC it gets busy after the noon hour.Started off with a Thai Ice Tea - large and refreshing. I went with the soft tofu Pad Se Ew and requested no broccoli. The food arrived promptly although they included broccoli! I blew it off and didn't make a stink about it but even my client mentioned he heard my request. The dish was still tasty and filling so I  was content.This is my clients go to place since it's near their office so I'll return again here and give em another try.For years I have driven past Ping Pong Thai always thinking it was an adult themed Thai restaurant with ping pong shows. No shows here. They only have food. Not even one ping pong ball:(I've tried the Panang and found it to be watery and bland. The Pad Kee Maw is consistently delicious and packs enough spice I am satisfied ordering it at Medium heat. This dish is the only reason I come here. It's certainly not for the service. The service is slow when dining in and good luck chasing down a refill. To Go orders are the exact opposite. Either way you choose you are still left feeling like a number. Boy do they pack the herd in at lunch.If only they had a Ping pong table I would gladly raise the star level. Maybe the owner is a ping pong champion from Thailand. Now that would be something to get excited about.IT's CALLED ATTITUDECame here on a Saturday afternoon for a rendezvous with some friends. Place was pretty much to ourselves. We accidentally spilled a little bit of our Thai iced tea and mopped up the table with several paper napkins. The only waitress saw it and allowed us to police our table. Asked repeatedly for napkin replenishment. It fell on deaf ears. Finally she drops off the napkins while serving our lunch. Finished our lunch which was most satisfying, she bussed our table and then slips away into the kitchen abyss. Spent in excess of $50 for lunch. She didn't bother coming out from the kitchen as we left saying good bye in Thai. Assume her presence in the kitchen took a higher priority.Thai people are renown for their friendliness... just not here. Oh well, there are so many other excellent Thai restaurants to be discovered.We came here on a Saturday evening and ordered 1. Pad see ew, chicken - 10.952. Panang curry, beef- 10.95 for 26- Unpleasant welcome. Sticky door. Unfriendly greeting, but seated right away. - 2 girls helped us. Direct service. No congeniality. Want drinks? Order now? Here's food. More Water? Check. Boring! I get more conversation and friendliness at a McDonald's drive-thru.- Presentation is poor. Looks like something that was poured on a buffet line. - Pad see ew noodle was cut short. no chinese broccoli. flavoring was very good. portion was small. - Panang curry was great. veggies and beef slices were good. good portion of curry but poor serving of rice. not balanced.- Self serve to-go. - No bye.- Best received to-go but don't dine in.Conveniently located (for me) on Sunset next to the park, a few miles from my office.  Solid 3.5 to 4 stars for their lunch specials menu.  I've eaten lunch at Ping Pong many times over the last 5 years, but I have never ventured off the lunch menu. Service has always been fast and friendly at this family run Thai restaurant and the food has been served hot and fresh.  The spiciness scale here is 1-4, and I find that a 3 is hot enough for me.  I've tried a bunch of the lunch specials, but always come back to the my go-to's, which are Pad Thai, Basil Chicken, and Pad Kee Maw.The lunch special comes with the soup of the day or salad and non-noodle dishes are accompanied by steamed rice.  You can substitute fried or brown rice for $1.00.  Coke products are $2.50.Not surprisingly, I ordered the $6.95 Basil Chicken lunch special on my last visit, with steamed rice.  It was delicious, per usual.  The veggies were crunchy, the chicken spicy and flavorful, and the rice helped cool down the spice when I needed it.My friend ordered the $6.95 Chicken Chow Mein lunch special and enjoyed it thoroughly.  She said she would definitely get it again.Lunch Specials are available M-F 11-4, and S-S 12-4.I've been here a bunch of times. The food is always good, the service is always great.

I don't know if I hit Ocean on an off night or what but I won't be back after my one experience here.I'm not a fan of this style of restaurant to begin with and I found the food to vary from average to poor.I've never had what I would consider good food at a Chinese buffet and have not eaten at one for years.  It will likely be years before I try one again.

@LasVegasHilton Weekend Brunch is $17.99 per person. Serving crab legs,prime rib a full breakfast and more.They have made to order eggs, steak,bbq ribs,fried chicken, lox,bagels and cream cheese plus they have lots of donuts,rolls and pastries.Service is good, line moves real quick so real wait plus the sportsbook is right there so you can watch the game while you wait in line.For under $20 for a weekend brunch a pretty good deal and the food is really good so it's well worth it!!After a long day walking the convention floor at CES, a few friends and I decided to have dinner here at The Buffet.  I've been here several times and have my favorite dishes.  This evening, I opted for Pizza, Macaroni & Cheese, Fried Chicken, Hot Link Sausage, and for dessert a Slice of Blueberry Pie.The food is pretty good.  My favorite is the Fried Chicken and Mac n Cheese.  The Chicken has a nice, crispy & flaky skin to it with the white meat tender and juicy in the inside.  The Mac n Cheese is thick and gooey....nom nom!Since it was dinner, they had the small bar open, so I had some Oktoberfest Beer to wash it all down....this was complimentary, bonus!Overall, we had a good dinner with great service.Will I return?  Sure.Definitely not the best buffet in Vegas, but when you don't really have any other places to go..it'll do. Options are alright..I did like the grilled veggies, but unfortunately they tasted like crapola. They had an omelette bar in the morning, and then pasta at night. The pasta was bleck. Mine wasn't made all the way through, and it was still warm. I got a bad tummy ache later on that night.The ice cream machine served delicious ice cream though. With some crumbled up butterfinger on the side. YUM.Having low expectations about this place, it actually allowed this place to exceed expectations.Staying at LVH, we got complementary coupons to try the buffet.  Knowing we were going to pay for a big dinner, we wanted to grab a small snack beforehand.  Sure, a buffet isn't quite a snack, but I wasn't expecting to eat much, and since it was complementary, the whole "eating what I paid for" concept that usually happens at most buffets didn't apply here.But the food was actually quite tasty.  They're currently having their FESTIVAL ITALIANO.  I tried a few items.  A couple of their pasta dishes, some meat from their freshly sliced section.  They even have a made to order pasta station if you want to be so bold as to create your own pasta dish.I was a little bummed we couldn't have any of the complementary beer and wine.  Apparently that is only for the weekends.Overall, a pretty decent buffet if you're staying at the LVH.

OMG! This place is delicious! IHOP who?! The buttermilk pancakes are out of this world! The homemade syrup is as well. A short stack is three pancakes and a full stack is six pancakes. A short stack is more than enough for the average person.They give you a huge portion of corn beef harsh. It's pretty good but, not as good as Pamela's.Their fresh squeezed orange juice is something special as well but at $4 a glass is pretty steep. I can buy a whole bottle of Simply Orange for that!My wife had a Reuben and a cup of Wedding Soup. The Wedding Soup was the best we have ever had but it had no noodles. Huh?A must try place! Get there early as they close at 3 pm.

They now offer all u can eat but watch the times. It is something like Mon-Sat 3-5 and 7-9 and all day Sunday. If you have not been here yet. Check it out. There is something for everyone here. Today we had the 3 piece with Fry's and slaw, but since the pieces were small he gave us #4. That was really cool. Everything was cooked perfectly and we had a great lunch.Dang. Duh -HAng This is goo foo! My mom is deathly allergic to shellfish. That, and I grew up in a desert for 10 of my formative years. When I think of shellfish, I think of slightly forbidden, delicious little delicacies. While growing up the idea of lobster and crab was the ultimate indulgence in haught cuisine, it seemed. . The only time my Mom liked fish is when it didn't taste like fish. "I like swordfish because it's not fishy", or "ooh orange roughy is so good! It's not fishy at all". I wanted fishy fish. I wanted something that tasted like the ocean. I wanted to see why lobster and crab was so expensive. In more selfish and morbid moments I hoped a chef would accidentally drop a shrimp into her food so she would die, and I could eat all the seafood I wanted. There's no lobster at Oscar's Pier 83, but you can get things here that are really rare in Arizona, and plenty of it is exquisitely fishy, in the freshest way imaginable. I did takeout and I ordered a lot of food: Oscar's Ultimate Combo (1 Jumbo Shrimp, 1 Jumbo Sea Scallop, 1 Oyster, 1 House Fish, 1 Chicken Strip, 1/4 pound Fried Clam Strips, Fries, Cole Slaw) THEN Fried Soft-shell Crab Crab cake Clam Chowder It was all at least 4 stars. The Exquisite: The Fried Oyster- My god this was good. Keep in mind I told you I like fishy fish, but this thing was fresh, juicy, full of meat, and perfectly matched my seafood craving. I thought it was a scallop at first, which is one of my favorite things on earth- but it was so much better than any scallop I've ever had. The Fried Soft Shell Crab- This was served with a pink remoulade like sauce that was divine. This thing was meaty, a little salted, and perfectly flavored. The remoulade was excellent. The Crab cake- It had a ton of crab in it. The only one I've had that was better was in Maryland overlooking the water. Dipped in the remoulade this more than just good. The Clam Chowder- It spilled in the car, in the bag, so I brought it in and ate the chowder with a spoon out of the bag. It was that good. The Very Good- The House Fish- Really good. Probably the best I've had. What's weird is that I think the excellence of the oyster and soft shell crab overshadowed this. Had I had this on it's own I'd probably be raving about it. It wasn't fishy at all. The Scallop- It was a little dry and bland. Very big however. The Shrimp- Better than a lot of shrimp I've had in Arizona- but not the best I've ever had. The Chicken Strip- Had I been more present at the time of ordering I would have tried to substitute this for something else. When I go again, I will order the soft shell crab, 3 oysters, and some clam chowder. Maybe I'll bring in my mom and Oscar will be the one to finally do her in with a stray piece of shrimp (DEVIL LAUGH). I kid, I kid.When people feel a cold coming, they pop a zinc lozenge or tablet to boost the immune system. I have a much better way to get my zinc supplementation: I head over to Pier 83 for their terrific fried oysters. With the first crunchy bite I begin to feel so much better. Placebo effect, probably. But hey ... as long as I get that feel-good boost, I don't care. The fish and chips are also the best I've had in the Valley. And to think that I've previously been trying to get my fish 'n chips fix from the likes of Pete's ... yikes! And their clam chowder is delicious; I don't need to feel under the weather to have an excuse for ordering this tasty bowl of comfort. The friendly staff and comfortable informal atmosphere complete the enticement for many return visits.Three words:  Crab Stuffed Salmon.  Now that I have your attention, please kindly direct your gaze upon an otherwise non-descript strip center in the west valley.  On the southeast corner of 59th Ave and Union Hills lies Oscar's.  It's small restaurant with an interior that somewhat closely resembles a seafood shack setup you'd expect to find along the shores of New England.  Simple wooden seating, photos and fishing emblems all over the walls, and oh yeah, dynamite seafood.  I had been looking for a new lunch spot to try during the work day and it just so happens Yelpers were giving this place solid marks for the food and especially for Ron, the owner.  When I walked in this time, sure enough Ron was manning the register.  Super nice guy who is super passionate about his product.  Based on my experience it's easy to see why.When you come in, you order at the counter and grab a table as they bring the food out to you.  The place looks like it seats about 40-50 people including the outdoor patio.  Be warned, the menu is lengthy with a ton of different items to choose from.  Ron can recommend items depending on your taste.  And if you're a regular, chances are Ron remembers what you like as he was naming off customer's favorite dishes in succession.  The place was about half full the whole time I was there with people steadily streaming in and out.  I just got a small table near the register since it was just me by myself this time.I had done my research in advance and decided to go with one of their big feature dishes.  A crab stuffed salmon dish with sides of crab pasta salad and mixed veggies.  They have a 10% Yelp check in discount you can apply to your meal.  Total price for the meal plus drink after the discount was about $17.  My meal came out in about 10 minutes.  I believe most of their dishes take less time, but mine is probably among the more complex on their menu.Ron enthusiastically brought it out to my table.  Looked and smelled heavenly (see my photo).  First off, let me praise Ron on the crab pasta salad.  They did not skimp on the crab with this.  I was able to get my fork on nice big chunks of rich crab (and even some shrimp) with every bite.  The cooked veggies were prepared very simple.  A little salt and pepper and include green beans, squash, and zucchini.  And of course, the main event.  The salmon.  A nice fillet with a line of crab stuffed in the middle from top to bottom.  Fantastic texture mixing the gentle subtle flavor of the salmon with the richness of the crab.  Seriously, I think this might be the best way I've ever seen salmon presented.  I pretty much crushed my meal in record time.  I was plenty full and happy when all was said and done.As I mentioned earlier, most of their dishes come out pretty quick and the prices for most of their dishes looked to be around $10.  They also have specials on a regular basis (today they had a grilled swordfish special).  They also have a decent selection of beers and wines to choose from at the front (as well as plenty of soft drink choices).  This place would definitely work as a lunch or dinner spot for sure.  Big time props to you Ron.  You hit it out of the park on my first visit here.  It certainly won't be my last, though it might take me awhile to try everything on the menu.  Or I might just dominate that salmon again.  Either way it's a win-win.People in this town wouldn't know good seafood if it knocked on their door and bit 'em on the nose. I guess I'm somewhat of a seafood snob being from NY and having spent my youth vacationing in Cape Cod. Now, don't get me wrong, this place doesn't have BAD food. It's just not as good as everyone makes it out to be. Let's be clear in one thing: The service was top notch and the restaurant was overall clean and casually decorated. I have no beef with the folks who run the place... Except for ONE thing... If you're going to tout your "signature dish" as being "crab stuffed salmon," it had better be stuffed with REAL crab. $16 for salmon that is stuffed with imitation crab doesn't sit well with me. Let's be honest and call a spade a spade. And it doesn't stop there. The crab in the seafood salad is also imitation. That can hardly be classified as fresh seafood.So, to conclude my little trip to Pier 83 I leave with a heavy disappointment. The service I'd rate a 5. The food I give a 3. I may come back and try something else but not the salmon again. Amd in would love it if they were honest and clarified on the menu that they don't use real crab in some of their dishes. It's just  bit misleading.

Finally, a visit to Nicky's!  It's been a long time in the making....but totally worth the wait!I'm a classic Pad Thai girl.  I know, I must stray at some point, to enjoy some other delicious goodness...but for my first visit, it was mandatory to try it since it's my fav Thai dish!  I ordered the Shrimp Pad Thai.  I just come to expect those little tiny shrimpies in my seafood dishes instead of the large and in charge ones, but I received about 5 large, freshly cooked shrimp. Major points, from the girl who eats every shrimp on on the plate at cocktail parties!  I'm into spice, but can't take a lot of heat (it just gets messy around the face area, trust me!) so I gambled and went with a 4 out of 10.  It was the perfect amount.  Made me a little sniffly, but no major tissue issues to worry about!  I was into the fact that there were almost equal parts sprouts, I love those crunchy little strings!  Super extra special bonus, a tiny crab rangoon that was awesome!  You definitely don't get one at Spice Island!  Although the one thing I do love about Spice Island is they use just the right amount of sauce.  I could have gone for a tad more on my dish...but that's me just being picky. The plate was massive and I ended up taking some home.  For me, that's a rarity, since I usually chow down the whole plate.  So you KNOW that's a ton of food!  Service was great and the place was tiny, but super cute and intimate.  I'll definitely go back and perhaps become more adventurous with my Thai food ordering.  I also have to try the Thai iced tea, I kept glancing over at my neighbor's.  But the Jasmine tea was just right for the day!I finally went back to NIcky's after almost a year! Time flies when you're having fun. Or taking time to eat my way through Pittsburgh. Irregardless... I believe the last time I was here I sorta wanted to be impressed more. This time, I was!I went all in and swayed from my usual Pad Thai and get crazy with another menu choice. Okay, I admit it wasn't super crazy. It was still a noodle dish, but hey, you gotta start somewhere, right? I ordered the Phad See Eaw, which is rice noodles with stir fried broccoli and sweet soy sauce. I 'm always into the shrimp, so I had to add some into the dish. And you know what? It was awesome! Maybe better than the Pad Thai. Wait, it was better than the Pad Thai! Huge portion, enough to enjoy the next day. Now I'm excited to go back and try other dishes. Since there's a new location downtown it will give me that much more of an excuse to head down there to "try" the new joint out. Hot Tip: BYOB and they do take reservations. We went on a Friday night and it was packed for such a tiny place, so remember to plan ahead!

Best eggplant parm according to this bonafide Jersey girl! The sauce tasted like it took hours to make (maybe it did) while the cheese was nice and stringy. Very comforting. Very generous portion with your choice of pasta.The garlic knots served with homemade bread at the start of my meal were so different from what I've known in a good way. They almost had a zeppole-like texture, great depth of flavor, and were not greasy at all- no need to constantly wipe my fingers. I couldn't stop eating them.Their version of cannolis are about 6 inches and filled-to-order to keep the shells (with or without chocolate) crispy. The filling has a nice consistency with a pretty good flavor.This casual venue is just 15 minutes from the Vegas strip and well worth a short detour.I don't get the hype about this place? Olive Garden quality food, but pricier and with slower service. My shrimp parmesan was soggy and drenched in watery tomato sauce, boyfriend's shrimp alfredo was uninspired and boring (tossing in some broccoli or a vegetable of some sort would not be a terrible idea). Overall the food was not cheap, but it was mediocre in every way and the service was slow. We waited close to an hour for something I could whip up in 20 minutes myself and have it taste 10x better.Montesano's is a friendly, authentic trattoria and more.  It is also a deli, pasta shop, and first-rate emporium of memorable baked dessert treats.  A server was slow to take our order, based on some initial confusion over who was assigned our booth.  But, once that hiccup was alleviated, all was well.  She was a fine server, but I would have liked to have been informed of the dinner specials like Lobster Parm I later saw on a board.  A sign inside the restaurant reads "Where love has a taste!" and diners are reminded by another placard to be patient because all food here is cooked to order.  I found great taste in these environs, and the freshly prepared food well worth the wait. I was initially surprised to see that dinners are served here with complimentary freshly baked garlic knots and bread.  Then the surprise turned to shock when the bread and basted knots were placed on the table.  There were 24 Garlic Knots--for only 2 diners!  They were small, but so what?  The doughy knots were warm and quite tasty, and the huge number made up for their diminutive size.  A dozen accompanied us home.I was less impressed by the fresh but earthy Italian bread.  It was sort of dry, and not that tasty.  But this was a minor setback.  For the Stracciatella (Italian Egg Drop) Soup was the best I have ever had: really hot and tasty broth, and chockfull of spinach and egg whites.  An immense "Caesars Salad" with one anchovy as requested, chopped Romaine, Romano Cheese, and fresh croutons was very good but almost overdressed with too much Creamy Caesar Dressing.  A Shrimp Cocktail featured 8 large shrimp that were good but tasted like they had recently been defrosted.  But I harbored no reservations at all concerning my entree of delectable Veal Montesano over Fettuccine, which was simply superb.  This very creative dish featured nicely pounded and tender, hand sliced, and lightly floured milk-fed veal medallions, artichoke hearts, fresh garlic, roasted potatoes, and roasted red peppers, and was finished in a delicate white wine and butter sauce in a brick oven.  The fragile artichoke petals gave the sauce a welcome hint of lemony flavoring.  And the fresh pasta undergirding the veal was cooked perfectly!  The whole edible conglomeration represented a delicious and very nice blend of harmonizing flavors.But I was by no means done, because a lovely, large "Black & White Cookie" in the display case had caught my eye when I entered the restaurant.  I went back to get a good second look, and then ordered it for dessert.  The unusual cookie, freshly baked on premises, was composed of pound cake topped by vanilla icing on one half, and chocolate icing on the other, and was moist and delectable.  The pure vanilla and chocolate flavors startled my taste buds.  Diane's novel idea of biting down on the black and white border to take in both flavors at once was a definite winner.  And, that lovely cookie was so rich that half of it accompanied me home, and even that amount lasted two more lunches!  Affable owner/chef Steven Montesano, attired mostly in red, flitted in and out of the kitchen, watched the front of the house, and came over to our booth to check on us a few times during the course of our meal.  He was a very cordial and accommodating host, and it is obvious that he takes great pride in his fine cooking and baking.  Deservedly so!4-1/2 stars overall!I HAD to come back. I had the eggplant parm and garlic knots again which remain consistently and wowingly delicious. Then I tried the Scungilli Diavolo over Pasta- sliced conch in a slightly spicy marinara sauce and parsley. The conch was cooked perfectly and was oh-so-yummy! Then I had the Tripe- a straightforward name- honeycomb tripe simmered for hours with plum tomatoes. The tripe was just the right texture, not chewy nor tough, and melted in my mouth. So good!  For all the dishes I've tried, the tomato sauce tastes different and delicious for each dish, which means they try hard. Our server, Melissa, was just super with friendliness and accommodations. This place is a must-see/must-taste!I met several friends for a casual lunch.  Feast would be more like it.  The Yelp friend who organized the lunch had pre-ordered what we were getting.  We had a table reserved in the back of this somewhat small mom and pop Italian restaurant.First, drinks were brought quickly when we ordered and refills were constant throughout our two hour lunch.  And then the food started coming.  First up was some bread--classic Italian bread and mini garlic knots.  Very tasty.  Maybe a little more garlic is needed for my taste but good nonetheless.Next up were some starter dishes.  We got two orders of what they call Lasagna Explosions and 2 orders of Rice Balls Montesano.  There were eight of us and the plates were such that there were 8 rice balls so everyone could have a try and 12 lasagna explosions.  The rice balls were breaded and deep fried with sauce and cheese.  The lasagna explosions consisted of rolled lasagna, breaded and deep fried and served with sauce.  The sauce was very good and it wasn't sweet.  They had the good sense to hold back on the sugar.Then came the second stage, the pizzas.  We were brought three different pizzas, a white pizza, a Sicilian fresca (Margarita), and a regular cheese pizza.  I had a piece of the white pizza and one piece of the Sicilian fresca.  My favorite was the Sicilian fresca.  Very tasty and thick crust the way I like pizza.  And you could have guessed it by now, each pizza was cut into eight slices so we all could have a slice of each.The next course was for the serious eating.  We got two orders of sausage and meatballs, two orders of seafood in garlic cream over linguini, two orders of eggplant Parmigiano with ziti, and an order of tripe.  The first two dishes had their meat sauce and were quite good.  The seafood consisted of shrimp, mussels, calamari, and conch over fettuccine in the garlic cream sauce.  I could have had a bit more garlic in the cream sauce.  Then came dessert.  We got an order of Zeppole and we were each brought a small plate with a cookie, a cannoli, and their three color cookie.  Desserts were very good.  By now, no one wanted to move we had eaten so much.Service throughout the meal was excellent.  As I said before, drinks were refilled quickly, plates were cleared, dishes being brought to the table were explained, and the two members of the staff that kept us happy were excellent.  One was Toniann, and I apologize I don't know the name of the other.  The were plenty of smiles and good humor from the ladies and at the end of the meal, they boxed leftovers in separate boxes, marking each so we could bring something home.  My wife had leftover ziti and eggplant and she was quite happy.  I didn't have to cook except to press a few buttons on the microwave.  Really nice lunch with some great company and very good food!Items Selected:Warm Bread and Garlic KnotsRice Balls MontesanoLasagna ExplosionsHomemade Meatballs and Italian SausageSicilian Pizza Fresca - Fresh tomatoes, garlic, basil, our homemade fresh mozzarella and Romano cheesesWhite Pizza - Ricotta, mozzarella, romano, butter, garlic, onionsCheese PizzaEggplant Parmigiano with ZitiTripeSeafood Special in Garlic Cream over FettuccineZeppoleRainbow Cake, Cannoli, Almond CookieButter CookiesSfogadellaFamily owned and operated since the 90's and a purveyor of traditional Italian cuisine for much longer than that Montesano's Eateria had been on my must-visit list even before moving to Las Vegas, but with an extensive menu of classic antipasti, pizzas, pastas, soups, secondi, and sweets the timing never seemed right to sample as much as I'd like - the solution found in the Italian tradition of a family style tasting with seven friends coordinated through the lovely Toniann Montesano herself.  Truly a 'mom n' pop' red sauce sort of place, said in the most complimentary of ways, with a full service bakery up front and walls strewn with signed celebrity photos, maps of Italian neighborhoods in various locales, and kitschy décor it was at a long table in the rear of the restaurant that we were seated and with superlative service, ample beverage refills, and enough food for a party twice our size the nearly two-and-a-half hour meal  could not have better met expectations - each plate perfectly prepared, well presented, and unquestionably delicious.  Beginning first with an opening volley of house-baked bread and supple garlic knots before progressing to fried options including creamy lasagna explosions and toothsome rice balls in bright, aromatic sauce it was at the second 'proper' course that the meal truly took flight, a trio of pizzas ranging from simple cheese and garlicky white on lightly  charred crusts alongside a pillowy 'Margherita' on buttery, thick focaccia-style crust that easily ranked amongst the best 'grandma slices' I've had to date.  At this point sated but certainly not stuffed it was with great spectacle that our final savory course arrived and featuring two platters each of Eggplant Parmigiano,  Housemade sausage and meatballs smothered in marinara, and a bounty of fresh squid/shrimp/sea snails/mussels smothered in creamy white sauce plus a bowl of supple braised tripe the table was literally covered as eyes stared wide - leftovers a guarantee, though all ate heartily with favorites varying from person to person and the tripe a personal favorite, especially atop slices of warm bread from the refreshed basket.  Taking to heart the gluttonous portions provided thus far dessert was ever so slightly scaled back as hot, spongy Zeppole dowsed in powdered sugar and filled-to-order cannoli both shined brightly while Rainbow cake, Butter, and Almond cookies were spot-on authentic  - a characteristic shared by a hot sfogadella that I requested as I paid the bill, ostensibly for 'later' had it not been so perfect...the creamy citrus filling beneath shattering layers not even making it to the car, no matter how full I was.I have had this place bookmarked for some time, so when given the opportunity to dine here with some fellow Yelpers, I was excited by the prospect. We arrived around noon and the place wasn't too busy. We shared a large number of items from the menu.Here's a list of all everything we tried:GARLC KNOTS: Really good. Really small, but warm, flavorful and soft. RICE BALLS: These were just ok. I enjoyed them, but they weren't notable. LASAGNA EXPLOSIONS - I don't usually like lasagna, but this was a nice change of pace from typical lasagna. Moist and very cheesy.TRIPE - My favorite part of the meal. I don't typically enjoy tripe, but this preparation was very enjoyable. Not chewy at all and didn't have that tripe-y smell that usually turns me off.MEATBALLS & ITALIAN SAUSAGE - This dish was ok. The meatballs are huge, however, and I enjoyed the tomato sauce.  SEAFOOD PASTA IN GARLIC CREAM SAUCE - This dish was just ok. the sauce didn't have enough depth of flavor for me and I don't see myself ordering this dish again if I returned.SICILIAN PIZZA - I'm not usually a fan of deep dish. This had nice flavor, but it was a little doughy for my taste. Everyone else seemed to love this pizza, so it's just a matter of preference.WHITE PIZZA - This was one of the standouts. The pizza was seasoned and cooked well. I could have eaten just this dish and been happy. EGGPLANT PARM - I absolutely love eggplant, but this wasn't my favorite preparation. Too much breading and the eggplant was sliced a little too thinly for my taste. I do enjoy how they serve ziti instead of spaghetti with this dish, since I'm not a fan of spaghetti.ZEPPOLES - These were my favorite of all the desserts served. I usually don't enjoy Italian desserts since they are a little denser than I prefer, so the zeppoles stood out for being a little more subtle and not overly sweet. Plus, I can never resist powdered sugar. RAINBOW CAKE - This was a little on the dry side for me. A little too chocolatey as well, but that's just a matter of preference.CANNOLI - I don't usually like cannolis and I can't say this one changed my mind about them. ASSORTED COOKIES - These were good. They have a number of varieties and I would be back for more of these for sure. Service was spectacular. Our drinks were kept full and everyone was extremely friendly and entertaining, making our meal that much more enjoyable. We all had a great meal and there were plenty of leftovers for all. I was able to take some home to my mom who's a pasta fanatic and she loved it. I'd definitely be back for pizza, tripe and dessert as those were my favorites from our meal.Montesano's could easily be overlooked with larger establishments like Panera and Buffet @ Asia closer to Eastern and mostly obscuring view of this location.  It sits in the small strip with Cheeburger Cheeburger behind Buffet.  It has a very unassuming presence, but is packed with delicious flavors.Upon entering, you're smack dab in front of the devilish bakery case full of coffee cake, cookies, cannoli, loaves of bread, cheesecake, etc.  Whilst waiting for an open table, you get plenty of time to peruse the offerings because there is limited space in the entryway.  Needless to say, the not exactly subliminal advertising worked on me and we left with a box of baked goodies to enjoy at home.This trip, after a 15-20 minute wait, our party of 2 was seated at an 8 person table with convention/banquet type chairs.  A bit odd, but at least we were in.  Drink orders were taken quickly, hot garlic knots and bread was brought out right after, and our order was taken within a few minutes.  We started with the Caprese Salad which was refreshing and delicious.  I ordered the Chicken with Peppers & Onions (Caccitore) over penne, which was divine.  The chunks of chicken breast were tender and the sauce was amazing.  I really enjoyed the bell peppers in the sauce.  The portion was enormous!  I ate about a 1/4 of my entree at the restaurant, and some more the next day.  It heated very nicely in the microwave. The BF ordered the Meat Loaf Parmigiano with angel hair, which he enjoyed immensely, but only got through a 1/3 of...more yummy leftovers.Our desserts to-go included one of the best cannoli we've had in Vegas.  A fantastic moist coffee cake, and an assortment of delicious cookies.  We have to stop forgetting about this place since we enjoy it so much for dine in and take out.

I love these kinds of breakfasts places, and I'm glad to see this one is still around.When we walked in the locals eating knew right away we were first timers. The cook/waitress/hostess asked us what we wanted with a smile on her face. This no-frills place has limited seating but the food is amazing. The best hash browns I've ever had in my life and it was so cheap, I was amazed. Go here for a quick breakfast but if you get a seat at the counter stay for some lovely conversation with the employees. They put a smile on my face and made my tummy very happy.

I swiped my badge at the time clock at roughly 5:32.As I walked wearily down the long gray corridor under the sickening fluorescent lights of my office building I felt overcome with weariness. The bleakness of my 9-5 schedule and the resulting placid evenings were grating on me. I stepped foot outside the building and lit up. The sun was setting, the clouds unfurling and soon the night would fall. I strolled over toward the light rail stop on Priest and Washington, the cigarette had made me queasy and I realized how hungry I was.  I contemplated some greasy tacos and a fat burrito from Fili-B's; semi concious of the direction I was heading, my stomach lead me by the nose- My brain was weakly suggesting tacos, but my stomach had seized power, and in this coup, resistance would be futile. My feet meekly obeyed and stomach was dictating, barking out orders like Idi Amin, 'Falafel!' he demanded. Sami's Gyros was mostly empty around 5:40, save two plump young ladies watching the Cowboys and Red Skins game, and the lone Greek fry cook cleaning his station, the door jingled and he looked up at me from under bushy eye brows, his dark eyes made large by the thick prescription lenses he wore. I walked up to the counter and in a voice not my own, made my order.  "A Falafel sandwich and an order of Hummus!" I demanded, slamming both palms on the counter. The fry cooks eyes bulged even larger and his lips parted, the mustache on his upper lip trembled as he replied "1 falafel sandwich, and 1 hummus plate? cccertainly.." he stammered.I handed a young woman in a pony tail with heaving breasts my atm card, she languidly rang up my order and stared strangely at me. I snatched my receipt from her fingers, turned on my heels and sat regally on a high stool that faced the plaza outside. Occasionally I'd glance at the game, it appeared as if Washington was winning, but I'd never been a football fan, and these teams especially didnt hold my interest.  Before I knew it my order came, the fry cook brought out my hummus first, I devoured it, then he brought my sandwich.  As I sat and greedily ate my sandwich, tzatziki sauce dribbling down my face and fingers, I saw one of my co-workers leaving filiberto's, panic and shame overcame me, I tried to hide my face behind my hulking sandwich, she passed by aloof, thankfully- the last thing I need at work is a new nickname. After I'd satiated my tyrant stomach with Sami's fare, I felt gladdened to know that crappy mexican fast food was not my only after work snack option.

Dos estrellas.My review has been fed into Yahoo! Babelfish Text Translation...twice.  First English to Spanish, then Spanish to English:Not more than two stars. It ate the tacos of fish, #6. combined. The fish was exaggerated and oily and now I have a pain the belly. The rice was good, the beans was hardly acceptable. My daughter ate enchilada of the cheese. She was just very well also. My wife had kidney beans of the rice and the swindle of the flutes. Once again two to star worthy. Moreno' s does not come until now near my hole preferred in the Mexican restaurant of the wall, Mess orderly from in the boulevard of the chandler hardly to the east of the 10. Grieved, as soon as can' t recommends east place.The original:No more than two stars.  I had fish tacos, combo #6.  The fish was overdone and oily and now I have a tummy ache.  The rice was good, the beans were just ok.My daughter had a cheese enchilada.  It was just ok as well.  My wife had flautas con arroz y frijoles.  Again, two star worthy.  Moreno's does not come close to my favorite hole in the wall Mexican restaurant so far, El Ranchero on Chandler Boulevard just east of the 10.Sorry, just can't recommend this placeI kinda feel sad about the two (2) star reviews, because this place is really good. I avoided this place for 3 1/2 years now (as long as it's been here) because it looked a little sketchy from the outside and I thought it was just one of those gross Mexican food places to eat at. I now find myself kicking myself. The hot dog cart is outside the entrance and all you have to do is go in and pay for your dog inside and they give you a ticket that you show the man outside to order. $3 for a pretty decent Sonoran dog grilled on a griddle, wrapped in Mesquite-smoked bacon, topped with chopped tomatoes, onions, shredded yellow or cotijo cheese, tomatillo salsa or red chili sauce, pinto beans, mayonnaise, ketchup and/or mustard, and served on a bun with a fresh-roasted chili. Oddly enough, I liked that the menus are on five different flat screen tv's. The Carne Asada burrito was phenomenal, way better than any other Mexican fast food restaurant. The salsas were tasty which is something that is very important since I always start the meal by drinking some salsa. If it is good, then the restaurant is good. Smoked chile and garlic salsa is always welcome! The green guacamole sauce is great!The tortillas are super soft and the beans were homemade, nice texture and flavor. I still prefer the rice at La Tolteca (but hey, no one can compete with that place) but it was still moist and flavorful. They seemed to have a lot of employees working here for such a small place but that's a good thing because the place was very clean and they brought our food to us.After an intense Sonoran hot dog craving, I decided to hop onto Yelp and came across this little gem of a place.  I rallied up my friend and we set out on an adventure for an early-dinner Mexican food quest!My friend had actually been here before.  He use to work in the area so he knows all the great spots on Arizona Ave.  With the great Yelp reviews and my friend's word, I was really pumped up!  I got myself a horchata, a Sonoran dog, and a Moreno's burrito [AKA a "wet burrito," with carne asada filling and enchilada sauce poured on top].  He had an agua de jamaica, a Sonoran dog, and a carne asada torta.  After polishing off a delicious Sonoran dog, I couldn't even look at my burrito!  I took a few bites of the fluffy rice, the smooth beans, and the flavorful yet kinda tough burrito and I was full.  I think I should have took the advice of another Yelper and ordered two Sonorans and called it a night.  That food coma is hitting hard!  My friend said the bread on his torta was a bit dry but he still took his food home so I think that's a good indicator.  Also, don't forget to stop off at their small little salsa bar.  Their green guacamole sauce is great!Anyways, there are limited parking and limited indoor seating so I can see how the place can become packed fast!  Service is superb and it's always nice to see such friendly and welcoming wait staff --- she really sold those hot dogs!  Portions are also huge and I really could have just split a torta with my buddy.  Anyways, upon reflection and a few more bites of my now cold burrito, I think I found a new favorite place in the east valley for Mexican.  I will definitely be back for the Sonoran dog and their horchata.  Yum!What can I say?  I'm an Elmer's Tacos fan.  I tried Moreno's asada and adovada tacos, and... if you put a big piece of gristle and fat up in my taco, I cant help but notice it as it slows my molar's roll.  You really jack up a taco by doing that... seeing as the tacos aint that big to begin with.I did like the sonoran dog, but it was a little clumsy to eat, with the toppings spilling all over my baboso shorts.  Also... weren't a fan of the oversized pepper that its served with.  But the avocado sauce at the salsa bar is pretty good

i went to this place on Saturday night and the two ghetto hostesses  literally had their heads down on the front desk. I had to ask them if they were open and they responded rudely then stared at me as if they didn't know what I wanted. I finally requested that I have a seat and I sat waiting for several minutes when I saw the waiter who looked like he was either high or very tired and not interested in working there. After I saw the first 3 employees, I decided that I was going to leave. I will never ever ever go to that Applebees.  It seemed like the place didn't have a manager on duty. Avoid this place.

Review Text :
There is absolutely nothing like Orange Julep anywhere! If you've flown in to Montreal, you might have noticed that huge Orange along the highway...and that's where you'll want to end up. This is a drink that is fruity, frothy, and delicious! It may look like plain ol' O.J. but you'd be wrong, it is a mix of fresh squeezed orange juice and some secret ingredient (my guess is powdered egg whites). Mixed together it makes a magical potion that you'll never forget. I am so glad they sell it in 2L size, because I could probably drink one all by myself in one sitting...don't judge me!They have some fast food items: hot dogs, burgers, poutine, and large stuffed pretzels; but you don't go for the food, you go for the drink.Wednesday nights in the warmer months are "Car Night" where people come by and show off their rims, engines, and whatnot. It's a fun, retro experience in a time where everything is going über high tech.

Chinese ChowWe were defeating the system as we purchased a mini Heinekin keg @ the on site "one stop shop" in the Rio. Beer filled Starbucks cups in hand- we walked around the casino and finally planted our butts @ the food-court like area right next to the sports betting. Perfect!Brew, the Lakers game, and a few steps from some grub. I hovered back and forth from the two choices and Mah Jong won (but not by much). A $12 hot dog verses a $12 Chinese food.. take YOUR pick. Highlights & Low-lights:*Pricey but think about where you are*Ordered the BBQ Pork Soup: The broth wasn't flavorful AT ALL but it's nothing a LOAD of hot and hoisin sauce can't fix*Pork itself was good but overly fatty*Lines can get long so of course the wait can get lengthy as well*Service was middle of the road *Lots of condiments out for your taste buds pleasureYes, I've had WAYYY better Chinese food. Would I go back? Maybe if I were staying in the Rio again and had my fill of Buffet madness. Not bad but not tooo good either!!

I woke from a drunken stupor not knowing where I was & how I got here.  The last thing I remember seeing prior to the temporary shut down of my eyelids was Blue Martini and the next thing I know, I ended up in the Philippines!  This place had all the makings of a typical Filipino disco lounge...the flowing San Miguel Beer, Filipino servers speaking Tagalog, and Karaoke!  We sat in the patio to get away from the interesting music selections by one of the restaurant patrons and because it was nice to be out there soaking up the mild summer heat.  The menu was a little blurry because the alcohol was starting to kick in a bit so all I could remember were the pretty steep prices & large selection of items.  I was a little disappointed that some of the entrees didn't come with rice because...well...Filipinos eat practically everything with rice!  Hearing "no sorry ma'am it doesn't come with rice" immediately snapped me out of my lethargic state and I almost keeled over in my seat.  I ended up ordering the topsilog (tocino w/ 2 fried eggs served over garlic fried rice) because of this.  I don't know if it was the alcohol or if I just didn't have high expectations but it was the best Topsilog I've ever had in my 26 years of existence!  The sizzling Sisig platter that the BF ordered was also just as good.  Who would've thought that the one of best Filipino food restaurants could be found slightly off the strip?!!  This will definitely be a a required stop the next time I'm in town...especially since I have yet to try the drinks there & the assortment of Pancit & desserts!!

The dessert crepe here with bananas and almonds is one of the top three desserts I've had in my life.  My husband and I stumbled across it in 2010 and purposely sought it out on this trip, now with our 2-year-old.  It lived up to the memory we had of it, and even our toddler loved it.  We didn't try the meal crepes, but we can't say enough about the dessert crepes here.  We will go out of our way to eat here every time we come to Montreal.

Wow, loved loved loved this place. The interior of the restaurant is beautiful and very classy, and service is amazing. They're very courteous and helpful. For lunch, there's a 3 course option for $25.15, which is so worth it. They also provide complimentary bread with olive oil from Greece, which I enjoyed very much. To start, I had the salmon tartare, which was very good and fresh. My companions had the lentil soup, tomato salad, and smoked salmon as appetizers, and they all loved their starters. We also split half a dozen of oysters, which were excellent. I had the white whole fish of the day as the main, which was Mediterannean porgie. It was simple but amazing and very fresh, and I love how they don't skimp on the portion size. For dessert, I had the baklava ice cream, which was super good. Also, random side note, their bathrooms are super nice! Super big and spacious and classy.Long story short, this place is amazing in every aspect - service, decor, food. Even if you're short on cash, go for the lunch menu! You won't regret it!

Review Text :
Sometimes thankfully not very often the travel schedule gets skewed and there's absolutely no time to eat between flights and the choices near the gate isn't exactly what you had hoped them to be. This is when you're caught between a Sbarro and a Burger King and on this particular day I really didn't have it my way so after contemplating just doing without I realized I was flying Southwest and they have nothing but a carbo snack basket and if I grabbed a slice of pizza worst case I could just eat the toppings so I did, yes it was horrible pizza but the service was very good and they did have a fresh right out of the oven pizza being sliced up when I joined the short line. I was also fortunate enough to find a small dirty table next the the exit only a short walk from my gate. I don't think it's something I'd do again....Staff was friendly and service was quick. Only one of the registers was working. Ordered the small spaghetti and it was the biggest ripoff. $4 for a little bowl of unsalted, watery, old noodles with a spoon of sour tomato sauce on top. Got a stomach ache before I could get back to my room upstairs.

Ennio is my BFF. I love him, I love his food, I love his jokes, I love his accent; he makes me smile and laugh so hard. He has shared so many stories with me, and at times his food has given me a glimpse of where he's been and what he's about.My absolute favourites are the eggplant parm and cannelloni. I've also tried the escargot, gnocchi, and Chez Ennio pasta, all of which were great but didn't hold my attention for as long as the eggplant parm and cannelloni did. I would still absolutely recommend them, though!This place definitely has some charm to it; it's cozy and feels like you're sitting in Ennio's living room while he prepares your meal and serves it to you. This is a one-man-show most nights, guys. So tolerate the slowness, go there and enjoy your evening, don't rush through it. Bring a bottle, or two or three, and enjoy the home-style meal with good company.

Restaurant name  New Orleans Sno Ball
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
Don't call them Sno-cones! New Orleans Sno Ball, Coffee, and Chicory  shares the same building on E. Indian School Rd.  as Two Hippies Magic Mushroom and Mamma Mia's Subs. They serve authentic New Orleans Sno-balls from an old-time Sno-Wizard ice shaver. They had 50 flavors, including old favorites like Cherry, Spearmint, and Grape, and other more exotic flavors like King Cake and Red Velvet Cake. We ordered the Red Velvet Cake and it was tops! The ice was very soft and the sno-ball had just the right amount of flavoring syrup. They carry coffee and chicory and some other Cajun/Creole cooking products and also sell Zapp's Potato Chips. The owner and sno-ball maker were especially nice, and will reminisce about New Orleans with you while you wait for your sno-ball!I'll be going back, especially if New Orleans Sno ball starts selling King Cakes around Mardi Gras. Until then, I'll keep coming back to get my sno-ball fix here.Completing our trifecta of food for lunch at the corner of 7th St. and Indian School on Saturday was New Orleans Sno Ball.  I let the kids choose between this place and Sacred Hogan for a dessert capper after Mamma Mia's pizza.  One went with frybread the other with Sno Ball.I liked this place immediately.  The congenial and conversant owner made us feel welcome as soon as we walked in.  I recognized that the shaved ice machine was older and more classical looking than the one I am used to seeing at our neighborhood Water & Ice.As he began making the shaved ice for my daughter I could see that the product coming out was much finer than we are used to.  My daughter ordered grape flavor and he was so busy chatting with us that he made orange.  He noticed as he was finishing that he had grabbed the wrong flavor and offered a taste before making another one.  My daughter chose to keep the orange.  Light and refreshing!Now there is only one more location to try at this intersection - Two Hippies burgers.  Perhaps another weekend outing.

Review Text :
Vasco is owned by the same person/people who own Ferreira. The difference is that Ferreira is high-end, while Vasco is more affordable, offering a variety of sandwiches, salads and desserts. It's suitable for breakfast/ brunch/ lunch, while Ferreira is more suitable for dinner. Ironically, the service at Vasco is MUCH better than Ferreira. Both offer Portuguese dishes. Vasco has basic staples that you will always find on their lunch menu and these include tasty delights ranging from the bison and vegetarian burgers, to the Ferreira club and preserved lamb panini. They have such a great variety of options that you would be hard-pressed not to find something that pleases your palate. My personal favourites are the veggie burger (made with quinoa), the Club, and the grilled veggie and goat cheese panini. All three are amazing.  All burgers and sandwiches come with your choice of salad, and you can usually find 4-5 different salads being served (these all change daily).  While all of their salads are delicious, my go-to is the sweet potato with curried chicken. At least I think it's curried. Either way, it is damn good salad!Their dessert selection is quite good for a small venue, and include the traditional natas and other pastries. If you're a chocolate lover, then you'll have to try l'Entrechoc - my FAVOURITE of all chocolate desserts! It's a tart with a firm crust (I think it's got a butter base but what do I know?) and i's filling is a combination of dark chocolate with caramel and whole hazelnuts. The top is a thin, crunchy crust. It's to die for! On that note, I've gotta go. There's an Entrechoc waiting for me with my name on it ;-)I gave them a 4 because the place is very small, and when you order to go, you have absolutely nowhere to wait for your food, other than at the cash, which has a table right next to it. The table is next to the entrance where everyone piles in to wait for a table. A bit chaotic. If you're going for lunch, get there before Noon and you'll be fine. Remember that the hostess will assign a table number when you arrive, and you will order your food at the back. A server will bring your dishes to your table. You can pay after you have ordered, or when you're done.

In Surprise this is probably the best Chinese offering which isnt saying a whole lot. I really wish there was an awesome offering out there in terms of Chinese food.. Mexican food, oh yeah, some very good places mostly but Asian, youre better off staying at home and cooking. We ordered the Asian Chicken Salad, chicken was old and had that old gross fridge taste.. Dan Dan Noodle, the noodles were over cooked and stuck together as one large soggy noodle.. Curry with Tofu, the curry had a weird perfume taste.. the honey chicken was pretty good as well as the hot and sour soup though neither made for good leftovers. With Surprise having so many chains it wasnt surprising to see one of these finally opening up.. a far better choice than Panda Express.. kind of sad, huh?My wife wanted to try this place for awhile now.  One of her brothers friends used to be a manager of one in Colorado too.  Tonight we decided to try it out.I placed my order online.  Easy process.  My wife went with an order of Chicken Lo Mein and I went with Sesame Chicken/Steak with fried rice as well as an egg roll and 2 pot stickers.  Total for everything was $24.80 after tax.  I drove down and picked up my food.  The manager their was friendly, rang me up real quick and I was out the door in no time. This bag was heavy as hell too!   Here is how everything tasted.....................Chicken Lo Mein-  Only had a little of this.  Good noodles, good white meat chicken.  My wife liked it.Sesame Chicken/Steak-  I decided to try out 2 kinds of meat.  They let you mix and match which is cool...they charge you for the highest priced item.  I substituted fried rice for white rice (.99 cents extra).  This was touted as soy citrus glaze, red bell peppers, onions, scallions, ginger, garlic and chile paste and sesame seeds.  It was just alright.  The flavors didn't really do much for me.  It was a tad spicy from the chile paste but overall it was kind of bland.  I had some pieces of steak/chicken that were a bit funky too.  I would definitely try out a different dish next time here...if there is a next time ;-).  The fried rice was good!Egg Roll- Eh.  It was an egg roll.  Nothing fantastic about it but it tasted fine.  It came with a sweet mustard dipping sauce which was pretty tasty.  Usual fillings of pork, veggies etc.Deep Fried Pot Stickers-  I got 2 of these things.  They were good.  Small but good.  Straight pork filling in the middle of them.  Overall it was just alright.  I will say that they give you a GRIP of food.  The 2 entrees we got could have easily fed 1-2 more people.  For $24.80 it was a great value.  The food just wasn't the type of thing that  you would ever crave and keep you coming back though.  While I was eating my meal, all I could think of were better Chinese food places I have had before....wishing I was eating them instead.  It filled my belly, service was friendly and the value is definitely there.  I'll probably give them another try and order some other dishes to see if there is something I really like.  We shall see............

I returned here for lunch yesterday with some friends, armed with a snap fax.The 50% discount made the meal really cheap,my friends paid around £3.50 for their burgers with chips, I paid £1.75 for my sweet potato chips (cannot eat gluten). This discount makes the prices extremely reasonable.The sweet potato chips were a little overcooked, but tasted pretty good and came with a huge dollop of sour cream. The burgers from 3 thumbs up. One friend got 'the ultimate kohl', a double layer burger with pretty much everything. Another went for the fajita burger, whilst my boyfriend opted for the falafel burger. Each came with a small portion of chips and some coleslaw, everything on the same trendy looking wooden board which Jenny mentioned. Everyone said the burgers were amazing, and they looked it. The rolls looked fresh, the fillings generous. The portion of chips seemed more of a token though, and I can imagine some people wanting more. If I could I would give bar kohl 3.5 stars, as I feel that whilst the quality of the food is good, it might not be worth the full price. I would say the same too about the cocktails.

Came here after a long vegas night, we were so hungry! You get to ride the elevator inside the coke bottle to get here, it's pretty cool!It wasn't very busy, we were seated right away and ordered. We ordered a burger and bacon cheese fries. Everything came quick and was pretty good- just the usually greasy fast food type of food. It wasn't very flavorful but I feel like I would respect anything crazy from this place.Good service, alright food and reasonable price.ok, so my last experience with Outback was not the best. this time taking into consideration we were in Vegas was much better .I came here with a couple of co workers and a dealer we all ordered steaks and they were all done right and nice cuts. of course we paid the price the difference between the Outback and Hugos Cellar in Vegas were about $20 I will take Hugo's hands down for service. the meat was on point in both places. we had great service and food and a view of the strip I got the checkI had SLOW-ROASTED PRIME RIBSeasoned with an herb crust, served with au jus and hand-carved to order and  wood-fire grilled. with a side of shrooms.everyone else had ribeyes and fillets but the went med well so I will not talk about that, there is no point to having beef jerky for dinner go bit into a slim jim!

I just finished my muffeleta sandwich from Dlicious Dishes and am trying to figure out a way to get back there as soon as possible to try more of the items! Workies and I ordered sandwiches to bring back from the office. They were D'LICIOUS! While there I also purchased some white truffle oil and 2 large wooden spoons. The place is filled with prepared foods that look amazing and priced well. There are also pastas and sauces and breads and all sorts of gourmet condiments. You need to check it out-- you can eat there or take it home. Either way, your tummy will be happy!I've been in here like a million times to raid the counter at Petit Fromage, but I had never actually tried any of the offerings from D'Licious Dishes.  Finally, the husband and I had way too busy of a schedule to go out to eat or to even make dinner at home so I picked up a piece of sausage lasagna and some garlic mashed potatoes here.Once I got home and reheated my food I nestled up on the couch to eat and watch Judge Judy.  I was not prepared for how delicious my food was going to be!  The garlic mashed potatoes were beyond perfect.  They were smooth and creamy but with some chunky pieces every now and then.  The garlic flavor was perfectly balanced.  You could definitely taste it, but you weren't tasting it hours later.  The lasagna was exceptional as well.  It was also really big for a really fair price, 7 bucks I think.  The noodles were a perfect al dente, the tomato sauce was fresh and robust, the ricotta was yummy, and the sausage had a great kick to it.  I have nothing bad to say about this place!  Plus, they share space with my new obsession, so how can I go wrong?OMG DD! OMG! I'm eating my roast beef sandwich now, typing this review and pounding my hands on the table like Meg Ryan in When Harry Met Sally...moaning, groaning and achieving culinary orgasms. Now that's a pretty picture for ya!House roasted roast beef with a blue cheese horseradish spread, red onion, tomato and my favorite green next to Brian Austin Green...arugula! All served on a yummy artisan roll. Such a cute place with a case FULL of delicious looking temptations from crab cakes to mashed sweet potatoes to chocolates and cheeses and VINO!! Great staff...friendly and helpful. Why I'm even a proud card carrying member of their sandwich club. And I'm sure it won't take me long to earn that free heavenly sandwich!DD! Fyi...I will return to you asap!

When I pulled up there were people out back bbq'ing  on an open pit and it smelled really good.They have the big $5 lunch special sign out front and after looking over the menu I was disappointed they only serve chicken,ribs and links here.No brisket, NO pork loin, no bratwurst, no chili,no mac & cheeseI ordered a 2x2-ribs & 1/4 white chicken plus potato salad & baked beansThe bbq sauce was very sweet and it covered everything. The beans were canned and the potaot salad was creamy. Really creamy?? Whats up with that?The ribs were tough and gristly with way too much sweet sauce on them. The chicken was juicy but crisy and the sauce worked well with it.I wouldn't go out of my way again but some people might like that outdoor bbq flavor.

Umm we were staying at the Palazzo and they said we still had to pay $20 to get into a club that looks hella dead inside??? You must be on crack Mr. Bouncer guy that needs to get the stick outta your ass. I ain't paying for that shit! I'd rather walk my ass to the V Bar where it's free and play better music.This has to be one of the best Nightclub experiences i've ever had.  Im from LA and have been on the club scene for 10+ years.  I'm kind of done with the club scene, but found myself in Vegas for a bachelorette party.We got a table at LAVO and the service and treatment was top-notch all the way.  I was beyond impressed and i'm a tough cookie to impress.  We had 2-3 waitresses for our group of 12 girls and they took care of us all the way.  I would compare it to the service I've gotten at a St Regis Hotel.  We also had our 1st bottle comp'd.  Additionally the club itself is beautiful. Gorgeous details and interesting things to see everywhere.The crowd was great too, good looking, classy for Vegas.  (We were at Prive the night before the the low-rent crowd there was SCARY- people stealing red bull cans off our table and sticking them in their purses with no bouncers around anywhere).Back to the LAVO review....And to top it off, I ended up losing my passport there somehow!  They found it the next day and Fed Ex'd it back to me immediately.Way to go LAVO - you get high marks in my book!!!!Getting on the guest list entails: still having to wait in line (granted it is a guest list line), free cover for ladies, and half price cover for the gents. A good plus for this joint is on Saturdays for about an hour (11pm-12am) there is an open vodka bar for the ladies. Holla! Let's be real though, they're not gonna be pouring Goose or Belvadere.  It's vodka from a bottle where the label is stickered on.  But hey after your fourth or fifth one...who can tell the difference..right? Haha. Music is good...but the dance floor gets PACKED!I couldnt hold out any longer and finally came out to a nightclub for the 1st time since being a new Las Vegas resident. I had heard about Lavo before (I always thought it was a pool... kinda like Wet Republic) but never went. Also, the thing about Vegas is, if youre a dude and you wanna go out to these popular nightspots with your boys (and plan to get in in a decent amount of time) you either gotta 1. spend $$$ like theres no tommorro 2. get lucky (walk in with some girls you just met, come up with some bs story about how you know someone there, etc) 3. come in late (past 130 or so) 4. or have a hookup.... Fortunately we had a hookup so off we went.The downstairs (restaurant) part of lavo is nice. They were giving us appetizers and drinks (on the house) all night, so no complaints there. A sizeable group of saints fan (congratulations!) were at the bar partying up. At about 11:30 we walked out and walked right past the line to the club (thats were the hookup comes in handy). Lavo reminds me alot of The Bank Nightclub at the Venetian. SMALL. We had bottle service, but there was no rope to keep away the straglers, so everyone was just mixed in (just like at The Bank nightclub). I thought the whole point of bottle service was to have your own space? The DJ was beyond terrible. I kid you not he did not play one song that was made after 2004 until right before I left. Just all Lil' Jon songs. Im not a DJ, never have been, and probably never will be, but I could have came up with a better list. The chick who won the first season of "For The Love of Ray J" (I think her name was cocktail?) is a gogo dancer there. I mean I had fun I guess, but there are definitely better places.LAVO on Memorial weekend = Packed like a can of sardines and it's one really SMALL can too!$20 cover..not bad...TAO was REDONKULOUS anyway!!! Hold hands..restrooms where?! Ouch! My feet hurt! I hate these heels! Why is that guy following you? Do you know him? I lost the guys!!!! TEXTTEXTTEXT...MEETMEETMEET...DRINKDRINKDRINK...DANCEDANCEDANCE!!! Is that Miley Cyrus playing?! I can't see the dancefloor. Let's make our own then! Hallway to bathroom sounds good. I can only move my upper body. My feet still hurt! I hate these shoes! PAPARAZZI PICTURES up the HEEZY!!! More dancing. It's only 2?! We need a B R E A K !!!! Long Beach cocktail is my new fav! Thanks Christian! Whiskey..yuck! Sorry Jay. This wall sure is nice to dance with and lean on! No I'm not taking a picture up her you know what! Vanessa, Melissa..frick it..let's go BAREFOOT!!! Why do we have TAO stamps on our wrist?! Maybe we can get in there now!! PEACE OUT LAVO!!!*****Wow..I can't believe I remembered all that! I guess that's what happens when you go on a spontaneous trip to VEGAS!!! Like my homegirl says, "that was a wham-bam-thank-you-ma'am trip!" Haha. Good times!Since we were staying at Palazzo, it was ideal to do some pre-partying at LAVO. As hotel guests, I'm sure the Concierge could have hooked it up for us, but as I knew a promoter, my girls and I got a VIP table and open bar from 11pm-midnight. Really, the BEST way to pre-party on a Sunday night.LAVO is a really nice spot for lounging, especially for a group of girls. The whole space is very chic and intimate, with the restaurant on the lower level and the club on the top. The cocktail servers are all gorgeous - loved their hot corset dresses - and very attentive. Once we were out of a drink, they were right on it. The crowd was very mixed - an all ages kind of spot. While it was awesome to see a female hitting the decks, the music was also very mixed and after Mariah Carey's "Fantasy" came on, it was our cue to leave. Not that I have anything against Mariah, but I like singing that song at a karaoke club.Tip: The promoters all hang out inside the restaurant, and they're pretty easy to spot as they're the guys in suits on their Blackberries surrounded by women.THE WORST EXPERIENCE EVER IN LVG CLUB I'VE EVER HAD.LAVO your food is mediocre and thank you for a special entry passes to your nightclub. Yes, your special meatball is pretty darn tasty.To be honest, I think thats where the problem begins. You let people eat here and get a special pass for the club. HOLY MACARONI. your nightclub was so crowded it was so bad. Up to a point my body was dancing by itself because people were squeezing me left and right. Drinks were spilled all over the floor. Slippery much? is this a club or ice skating rink? Dance? what dance? I can hardly move and breathe. AND COME ON! THOSE STAIRS? don't you know we girls wear at least 5 inches of high heels? ugh. Oh yeah, better music though compare to XS. But omg, never again for this nightclub.An invigorating dining experience awaits you at Lavo.Upon walking in, you're caught off guard by the perfectly dim lighting and their gorgeous set up. The hostesses were very warm and made you feel welcome. This place screams trendy but definitely not overbearing or pretentious.  We were seated at a roomy booth and were promptly offered drinks and our menus. Our server made it a point to be friendly enough to be likeable, but not overly talkative. The first thing you'll notice is the crowd. No riff raff, just beautiful women and seemingly affluent men. Their menu simple but elegantly put together. Their complimentary bread served with some sort of a tapenade was a great starter.  We ordered the oysters (well not for me), the kobe stuffed rice balls, and their white truffle fettuccine with truffle caviar  (which was that night's special).The portions were about average for an upscale restaurant, so there were no surprises there (negative or otherwise).  The ladies had some red wine, which I think they enjoyed with our meal. The servings were sufficient for the three of us. You definitely don't walk away hungry. Everything was above average in taste, but one thing blew my mind: the chocolate bread pudding with vanilla gelato which we ordered for dessert. It was OMFG-heavenly.  Each bite was paired with a compliment. Yes it was that delicious.  Forget everything else, you just have to try this. Overall, I think what made this experience a 5-star was how well the atmosphere, service, cuisine and of course the dessert just meshed incredibly together.  It's one of those things where each individual factor contribute to an even better outcome. We'll be back for sure.Beautiful Italian restaurant inside the Palazzo, with an outside terrace which is where we dined. We took my sister and husband to celebrate their Anniversary. The inside is trendy, soft lights, romantic, and very comfy. When we were taken to our table, it took a bit long for our waitress to finally come greet us. Throughout our meal she was just OK, she seemed to be in a rush every time she came to our table. Not sure if she was swamped but when you are paying good money I do expect better service. We ordered a few cocktails and a bottle of wine. I chose a Super Tuscan at a reasonable price, when the bus boy brought over these awful little by the glass thick short stemware. Um yeah if I order a b bottle of wine please give me decent stems. After I politely asked him for nicer glasses he did bring over much nicer stems. Of course my sister and brother in law thought I was being a wine snob. It's all good, they have no clue. ha ha We started with some appetizers, mussels, and an eggplant dish all were very good.  The eggplant was awesome!  Then entrees, we all ordered different dishes, their menu is fairly large with many options to please everyone. The presentation was nice, good size portions, cooked fresh. All of our entrees were good, nothing to great. I was not to wild about their marinara sauce. It was sweet and too thick. My sister and brother in law loved their food, and was very happy we chose this restaurant. Food could have been much better as it was forgettable for me. And service well they need some improvement. The view outside was gorgeous, it is a very pretty restaurant, we did enjoy our evening but next time I am so wanting to try "Tao". Prices were high, for Italian food that was just average at best.Yum, yum, yum! When I am in Vegas there are a few things I look for in a restaurant. First and foremost I want the food to be fabulous, check! I want the atmosphere to be alive. I didn't come to Vegas to order room service or go to some quiet empty place. And I want good service. Lavo passed all my 'Vegas requirements' with flying colors. When you arrive you are brought warm garlic bread and marinara sauce. It's the perfect start to the meal and it's hard not to eat all of it.  For starters we shared what seemed to me to be the worlds largest meatball. It was fantastic - moist, and flavorful. Also covered in that tart and sweet marinara sauce.  We also had the beet salad. A healthy choice still packed with tastiness. For entrees we had the chicken, the pasta and a steak. Everything was delicious!This nightclub is disgusting, trashy & classless. Definitely not a Vegas-worthy establishment.Bouncers....um assholes much? They cut off our girls' open bar wristbands for no apparent reason. Damn I know my girls are smokin hot but don't throw a pout cuz they didn't flirt back with you.The line was indeed small but like any other clubs, they try to make it look poppin by allowing 1-2 persons in per every 30 mins. Not very smart & efficient. Clubs make more money off of alcohol bought inside the club & not on cover. So get everyone in fast & you'll profit from that. Duh.My gal friend is a legit Vegas regular so we got hooked up with VIP (reduced admission for guys & no cover for girls) and line-skip tickets. It was $10 entry for guys with the VIP ticket.The venue & space was dark, ugly, small, and awkward. Like a dirty asshole you don't wanna fuck no matter how desperate you are for some fun & action. That restaurant downstairs TOTALLY destroy the nightclub vibe. Seeing families eating while you're inebriated is not the business !!Open bar = cheap alcohol & limp drinks. I believe there was only one big bar on top of the dancefloor. Speaking of dancefloor, it was tiny, yet there was still room to dance. Hence there were barely anyone in the club for a Sunday night.If a club doesn't play house....I don't consider it a club. I don't mind hip hop either but the DJ was playing rap & underground rap mixed with a little bit of hip hop. Um what? This isn't some ghetto club. Play some Kaskade or Jay-Z please. kthanks.The people...HAH. That's all I have to sayInvest your time and money at XS or Marquee !! Where the party is crackin hayyyyy***Club Review***My friends and I got in without having to pay the $20+ cover because we were in town for NAB and our passes got us in for free. That was the one of the few good things of our experience here. The DJ and the music was also pretty good. No complaints there. I'm not even complaining about the $8 I spent on a Newcastle.I am however complaining about the staff with attitudes that work here. I'm also raising an eyebrow at the staff about our missing items. Here's what went down:Sunday 4/15On the dancefloor, a random patron taps my friend on the shoulder to ask him if he lost a cell phone. My friend looks at the phone, says it's not his, then witnesses the patron turn the phone in to the DJ. Several moments later, my other friend realizes that his cell phone is missing only to find out that this was the same phone that was found earlier. Both friends go to club security with the info that the phone was given to the DJ only to find out that club security took it to hotel security. Hotel security has no record of it.Tuesday 4/17While in line to get in, one of our friends steps away to find hotel security to hopefully get more info on his missing cell phone. When he returns, the club bouncer immediately extracts him from the line. I understand that he was only doing his job and not letting people cut. But rather than telling him to get to the back of the line, he flat out tells him to leave. He wasn't gonna let him into the club! I mean, our friend wasn't even intentionally cheating his way in. I'm sure that the 2 people in line behind us didn't mind that we saved our friend's spot in line but even if they did, we wouldn't try to disrespect them. The bouncer just wanted to throw his power trip around on a tuesday night. After some major ass kissing on my friend's part, the bouncer finally let him go to the back of the line.On the dancefloor, another friend realizes that her clutch purse is no longer on her wrist. In a panic, our whole group is searching the entire club for the purse. Club security notifies us that it was found but when they hand it over, her iPhone is missing. One of the guys in our group continued to question club security about the missing iPhone who claims that they haven't found one. But in desperation, our friend says to security "I'll pay you $20 for the iPhone" and security's response was "Wait, what color did you say it was?" WTF??? Why did security suddenly change their story the moment my friend offered a bribe?I do however have to say that the random patrons that we met at this place has been extremely cool and genuinely concerned with all the bad stuff that kept happening to us throughout the night. We even got invited to hang out in the VIP area for table service by a few different groups. Again, I understand that staff is doing their best to make sure that the tables stay reserved for those who reserve it. So when one of the waitresses told us that we had to leave, I tried to politely explain to her that the people who reserved the table invited us to drink with them. She responded with the biggest attitude: "Don't yell at me!" Um...hello? I wasn't yelling at you. I'm just talking loud because we're in a club and if I don't talk loud then you won't be able to hear me!The staff here needs to get over themselves. SMH.Night Club review:Very nice decor; bath (Lavo) themed.Bar area is in weird shape. Bartenders were not very nice at all.Dance area is small. Overall club is small.More of a lounge type than club.Too many bottle service areas. This place needs more dance areas.Place needs better ventilation & shouldn't allow smoking went it's so stuffy inside.They play house & trance here. Open bar for ladies from 11 pm-midnight.If you know a promoter, they can usually get you in free & ladies free drinks & table.   Doors open at 10:30 p.m. Fridays and Saturdays and 11 p.m. Sundays, Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays. Cover is $20, and locals are admitted free Tuesdays, Wednesdays and ThursdayI just remember coming here when the girls and I were super hungry and ready to go on a carb binge. Eggplant Parm is phenomenal. They have a salad here call the Louie Salad which is a mix of seafood (lobster and shrimp) served over greens and vinaigrette topping. One of the best salads I have ever had. Drinks are served in slightly smaller glasses here, but don't let that fool you... way more alcohol than anticipated, and that creeped up on us after about an hour. Sneeeeeaky bartender!I haven't had the pleasure of dining here yet but Im sure that's in the near future. But this place as a nightclub... is awesome. Came here a few weeks ago with a group for Dash Berlin. We had the table directly behind the DJ booth where we got to enjoy the music and intimacy with the DJ all night. It was truly an amazing experience. I really like venues like this one and Marquee Day Club. Where you can actually mingle with the DJ before/after his set. The ambiance was beautiful as well. Bartenders were great along with our cocktail server. I will defineatly be returning to this venue in the fiuture.This nightclub was a dud.  My girlfriend and I stayed at the Palazzo, as such we decided to check it out since we didn't really want to leave the casino.  Upon our arrival, we were directed to a very long line.  We were supposed to be on their VIP list, and that long line was for VIP guests.  WTF? I might as well wait at the regular line because it moved even faster than ours.  This club did not live up to my expectations.  I expected spacious dance floor, high ceiling, opulent decoration.  What I saw was a tiny dance floor that we could barely move.  The club itself was very small compared to XS and some others.  I felt claustrophobic being inside this place.  My girlfriend's foot got injured because people stepped all over us.  We left after 30 minutes.  It was definitely not one of our best experiences.  I want my money back.  It's good thing we didn't pay or I would have tried to get my money back.Items selected:Illy CoffeeBalsamica - Rum, Rhubarb, Basil, StrawberryPastry Basket - Everything Bagel, Focaccia, Oreo Scone, CronutChocolate Hazelnut, Strawberry, Crème Anglaise DipBreakfast Mac & Cheese - Two Fried Eggs, Truffled Shells, PancettaAlmond Crusted French Toast - Cinnamon Panettone, Fresh Berry, BananaChicken and Waffles - Cap'n Crunch Crusted Chicken, Bourbon Maple Syrup, Spiced PecansWarm Chocolate Bread Pudding - Vanilla Ice Cream, Duce de Leche SauceA favorite of friends for their signature meatballs, thumping bass, and eye candy I'd never paid much attention to Lavo until I heard rumor that a "proper" Sunday brunch had been introduced - an interesting menu, beautiful strip views, and proximity to both Bouchon and Ferragamo making it a worthy destination for 2pm brunch on my mother's last day in town.  An ornate space clearly befitting its trendy nightclub roots with friendly, though somewhat cocktail-pushy service and excessive hyperbole (no, your chef did not 'create' the cronut, nor was he the first to coat chicken with the cap'n) it was with the aforementioned bread basket, freely refilled coffee, and a cocktail that our meal began and with the basket particularly impressive given its complimentary nature it was much to my delight that the rest of the cuisine followed suit; substantial delay due to our waiter flirting with two tables full of sorority girls notwithstanding.  Electing to sample two sweets and two savories it was with a trio of selections and the smooth, dense, and semi-molten-centered bread pudding to follow that our meal progressed and attempting to abstain from exaggeration I will simply say that if I returned I'd be hard pressed not to order the exact same thing, the French Toast harkening a fruit infused Bostock and the pasta a peerless example of knowing how to use truffle oil with restraint, the end result a dish warranting an extra slice of focaccia to sop up every drop of the eggy aromatic cheese.This review is for the CHAMPAGNE BRUNCH. Lavo Champagne Brunch runs every Saturday during non-pool season from 2-6pm. It takes place inside the restaurant, not the nightclub. I am not sure what the cover charge is, but our promoter for Marquee was also working as a promoter for the brunch and she got us in right away with no cover and no waiting in line. So be sure to look into that option first. We arrived at 3pm and it was a little weird because people were just eating at tables and there was a dj spinning and gogo dancers. There is a minum purchase for a table with food and/or drinks, just like at the nightclubs. Once it became about 3:30 or 4, the place went full on nightclub status. The lights were turned down, the music was turned up, and everyone was dancing and waving light sticks. Drinks: Pricey but on par with Vegas prices. Most drinks were $13, even a glass of champage. Attire: Guys should dress dressy casual. Girls can wear anything but most girls wore short dresses that are slightly less dressy than the ones you would wear to a nightclub. Overall, Lavo Champagne Brunch is a fun place to get daydrunk and preparty for the nightclubs.*** Review for Spring Restaurant week 2014 menu ***What a great way to end Restaurant Week!  I had a reservation and asked to be seated on the patio (the Terrace, the occupancy sign says).  The sun was in my face for about 15 minutes before going before going behind Treasure Island.  It was a great evening to sit out and enjoy the outstanding Las Vegas weather.I was seated a few seconds when my server, Casey, came and took my drink order.  My iced tea was delivered quickly.  A different server came to take my order.  There was no Restaurant Week menu sheet with my regular menu so she just told me some of the choices.  After making my choices, a runner came by with aluminum foil wrapped garlic bread with a dish of marinara on the side.  Super garlic bread and very good marinara!Back to ordering.  For course one, I went with crispy fried calamari.  It came with a side of the same tasty marinara as the garlic bread.  The serving size was huge.  This would definitely be an appetizer to share with one or two other people.  I sent almost half of it back so as not to fill up on calamari but I could have finished the plate.  Lightly breaded and fried lightly, it was very good!I chose the penne alla vodka for course two.  It was a good sized serving and it was very good.  I slowly ate the penne enjoying each bite and forcing myself to have more garlic bread.For dessert, I opted for the raspberry cheesecake.  The cheesecake was lightly flavored with raspberry--just barely noticeable.  The top was crisp from lightly torching the top like you would a crème brûlée.  There were several black cherries on the plate that was a good accompaniment for the cheesecake.Service was excellent.  Casey came by often and topped off my iced tea, dishes were removed promptly by bus people, and my check was taken for payment by someone who had not been at my table at all.  It was a case of everyone watching how all the guests were doing.LAVO Brunch is so strange. It's pretty much ratchet night clubbing during the day. But don't get it twisted with Vegas pool parties; LAVO is on a whole 'nother level.I really wanted to go day clubbing but Marquee Dayclub Dome was closed over the weekend and all other pool parties had ended for the season. When my promoter suggested LAVO Brunch, I hopped on the opportunity. None of my friends wanted to go, so it was just Craig P. and me.We arrived around 3 pm and thanks to my promoter, both of us walked in for free without a wait. The moment we stepped in, I regret my decision. It was crazy inside. LAVO is an actual restaurant with dining tables all around. People were dressed to the nines, brunching, eating on dining tables, and DANCING on them, along with several go-go dancers. The restaurant is dimly lit, misty, and foggy inside. We weren't trying to get pussy misted at three in the afternoon so after a 5-minute walk-around, Craig and I were over it and bounced.If this sounds like something you'd enjoy, then by all means, come and have fun! It's about $100-150 per person if you want a table, brunch, and bottles. But if you're looking for something more chill, like Marquee Dayclub or Encore Beach Club, LAVO is not the place.Been to LAVO for both brunch and dinner time.FYI....LAVO isn't a full-on nightclub anymore. It's only open on weekends until 2am as a lounge style. There's still music being played I'm sure, but just don't expect it to be a night out full of visual effects, big DJS, dance floor...etc.Restaurant-wise.....food was delicious. They gave us a basket of garlic bread to start off with. First batch is complimentary. Waiter was attentive throughout the night. Keep topping off our drinks. For entrees, I ordered:Brick Oven Salmon Oreganato ($31) -Seasoned breadcrumbs, lemon, white wine, garlic butter. I've never been a fan of seafood but WOW! This was flavorful,  fresh and cooked to perfection. The salmon with the buttery sauce just melts in your mouth.My boyfriend ordered:Grilled Tuna with Roasted Artichokes ($36) -Yellow fin tuna, oven roasted tomatoes, lemon vinaigrette.We both enjoyed our dinner very much....plus that complimentary dessert platter with cheesecake brulee and fried oreos dipped in melted vanilla ice cream was just the icing on the cake to our fabulous dinner date.  =)One thing I do have to mention, the restaurant MAY be a bit dark and loud to some people. (Fobby Asian parents come to mind. LOL) But this restaurant is a definite repeat. I know there are plenty of other Italian restaurants here at The Venetian or Palazzo...or even Las Vegas in general, but I would rank LAVO over Dal Toro or B & B Restaurante.Happy Anniversary to us!! We threw on our exercise clothes and walked from the Aria to the Palazzo.  (Yes, we were completely sweaty because of the heat, but let's face it, we needed to sweat out the booze from the night before!) We stumbled upon Lavo and stopped in for brunch completely on a whim.  Um hello...it was absolutely delicious.  Nothing was a problem and we felt completely pampered.  We left happy and full.  A perfect addition to our weekend--thank you so much Lavo!!

How could I have missed this resto after living in Mtl for 4 years? Well, likely 'cause most of my McGillian friends have never come here. They should have. Place Milton is the place for hangover recuperation.Though, mind you, it's not a bad idea to read there alone with a coffee. Very inexpensive breakfast. I think it was around $5 for a basic breakfast combo of coffee+eggs+sausages/bacon+toast. Coffee comes hot and fresh. A soothing balm for an upset stomach. I would not recommend going with more than one person. There's clearly a solo or couple atmosphere. Heard it gets really full on weekends.

I finally decided to try this place out, despite the mix reviews I keep hearing about them.  I figured if WFNZ is promoting them, it can't be all that bad.  Now, besides all that, I had a $10 off coupon, and had just got back in town from the beach and was thinking this place had better be good because there will be no cooking in my household today.  I think this place is more of a bar than a restaurant since it's Sunday and the only 2 people here were not eating but watching football.....not a good sign but I stayed and ordered the pork chops, and hamburger steak, both came with 2 sides and a roll.  I must admit that everything was really good:Pork chops-3.5 stars(a bit too much salt)Hamburger steak-4 starsMac n cheese-4 starsGreen beans-3.5 cannedGreens-3.5 canned(very sweet)Rice-4 starsI did hear the server say that the cook that was there today was the best cook on staff.   I would probably frequent this place if I lived closer, but I would return.

Review Text :
Brass Monkey isn't just a random bar that you pop into for a pint. Well, wait, it is. Ok I have notorious foot-in-mouth syndrome, so don't take that as a bad thing. What I mean is, yelpers and visitors shouldn't judge or review Brass Monkey on one visit alone.If they did, they'd probably still be pretty impressed. Maybe even 4 stars worth. It's got charm. It's cosy. There's a good crowd and whether it's quiet and chilled or busy and buzzing, it's still comfortable to mooch, drink or banter in. It's got that perfect mix of students and non-student, regulars and visitors. It's got lots of beers, lots of rums in particular, cute wee food deals (soup and sandwich and a pint for £5 I think). And it has free wifi.But the real charm and that final 5th star of Brass Monkey comes down to the staff and if you start to come here a lot more often. They're friendly, charming, bearded (just don't ask to touch their beards). They'll banter away for as many drinks as you can please. But, and most importantly, they're not cliquey. Yeah, the regulars hang at one end and it's obvious they're regulars and know the staff. But you're not made to feel awkward for bantering in equal measure and becoming part of the bar stool furniture for a few hours.So I've let the cat out the bag and letting it be known that whilst I rarely have the routine or time to have a local, if I did, it'd be Brass Monkey. And for a local, it easily deserves 5 stars and then some.Mmm beardy.

I feel bad bashing what is obviously an old, well respected fixture of the Park Road shopping center. But I gotta do it. The decor is so great, so checkered, so old school diner. Lingering smoke, very intense. Mirrors and bored hostesses. Awesome.For a vegetarian, this place is optionless after 11 am (an no, they won't fix you an omelette if it's 11:10 - them's the breaks) other than the veg plate and an amazingly, insanely bland egg salad sammich. So that's what we got : egg salad on white (there was no mayo, no herbs, no nothin going on here) with a pile of diner fries, good fries, and a veg plate - 3 slices of tomato, 4 banana-tasting slices of fried to liquid zucchini, three broccoli florets with a somewhat creepy "hollandaise" dripping into a pool at the bottom of the bowl. For 6 bucks.  There's so much better food to be had in this area (hell, even this shopping center) for the same price or cheaper.

Restaurant name  Ohana Hawaiian BBQ
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
It's been almost 2 years since I last eaten Ohana Hawaiian BBQ.  The last time I was here, I got their Salmon with rice which I thought was one of the best Salmons one can get, especially at a Hawaiian restaurant.  On my most recent visit, I opted for their Katsu Mini and a Katsu Masubi.  I really wanted a Loco Moco, but cut off red meat for Lent. First of all, let's talk price and portions.  Price is probably one of the cheapest out there and the portions are huge.  My Katsu Mini looked as big as a regular.  My only issue is that it was missing some taste.  From the rice, the macaroni, and to the Katsu, taste was lacking and it was super bland. My Katsu Masubi was also missing taste. If this restaurant was in SoCal, it may be considered really good stuff.  But with the amount of Hawaiian restaurants out here in Las Vegas, I would say Ohana is just okay.  My co-worker had lunch with me.  He never eats anything outside of Pizza, Burgers, BBQ, etc.  In other words, he doesn't eat outside the box.  For the first time, I actually witnessed someone order a Cheeseburger at a Hawaiian restaurant. Hilarious stuff and he thought it was just okay, nothing special.  On a side note, this restaurant also carries Chinese Food.  You can get what looks like Orange Chicken here and noodles.  Really??  Couple of things I do like about this restaurant is the details and pictures of their food. Almost every item that you can order has pictures represented. Overall, I really don't see myself driving out of my way to come here. The location is far from the usual areas I'm in anyway.  However, I still remember how good their Salmon was.  Maybe my next trip is just for that.If "ohana" means family, what's the Hawaiian word for tasty?Nothing fancy here, just straight up Hawaiian styled food. I've been trying to eat less carbs lately and I figured maybe a giant plate of meat would be fine for lunch.I ordered the BBQ Mix plate with chicken, short ribs, and BBQ beef. This massive BBQ plate is a great lunch fix and for anyone who needs that premium protein boost. The chicken was very tender and plentiful and the BBQ beef was perfect! I could have eaten the entire cow if it came prepared like this.The Short Rib on the other had almost no meat on it at all. I know short ribs don't normally have a ton meat on them, but usually there's a little to nibble on. This small set back didn't ruin my lunch, I mean; I still had three pounds of chicken and BBQ beef to eat. As a wild card option I ordered the Chicken Katsu Musubi. This was very interesting, but also very good. The crunchy katsu chicken with the soft sticky rice was a great combo. They have multiple musubi options including the classic spam musubi, just incase katsu chicken isn't your thing. With my sodium levels through the roof and my belly full, I would say that this was lunchtime victory. Would I come back? - DuhMahalo!

Our trip to Vegas could not be complete without trying one of the best Bún bò Hu (spicy beef soup) places. I must admit I was a bit disappointed that there was no Pho but I was up for the challenge of trying something new. We started with an order of Vietnamese BBQ spring rolls with peanut sauce. The spring rolls were pretty yummy but nothing special. Next came the Bún bò Hu, I was a bit hesitant about trying the blood jelly. But everything else was tasty; the spicy broth was my favorite part of the meal. Service was fantastic, super friendly and knowledgeable. P.s. This place is cash only.

Coffee - horrible.Baklava - mediocre.Straight table setup right across from front door - hella drafty and uncomfortable.Bathrooms - rather disgusting.I needed to warm up in cold winter night, it was there. Can ONS term be applied to coffee houses? I will never see you again, Cafe Noir. You suck.Yikes.

Review Text :
In the city of Longueuil, which is across the water from Montreal in what is called the south shore area, is the quaint old town area of Longueuil. This little strip is dotted with little shops and restaurants, including this one, La Magia. The restaurant is in a sort of old house, with the front room cleared out for diners. The food is casual, and good for lunch, offering salads, pastas, and pizzas. I had a nice Spaghetti Pancetta, which included a nice side salad, for $11.95, very reasonable and done well. Service in the busy lunch hour was good, too.It's a bit pricey, and the portions are small. I had bruschetta, it was yummy. I had the vegetarian risotto, which was amazing! I spent $60, and the waitress forgot about me, waited nearly 30 minutes for her to pick up my payment. I had two glasses of wine and I'm a light weight so I hadn't noticed that much time had pasted, the book I was reading kept me entertained.

Review Text :
This might the sushi sleeper in Henderson.  I met a coworker for lunch here since it is near work, at her suggestion.  They have lunch specials, plenty of cooked options, and sushi.For my first time here, I figured the lunch special is a pretty good deal. $12.50 for 6 pieces of sushi or sashimi, 1 roll from a list, and miso soup plus salad.  There were also lunch bentos (pick 2 from a list) but all were cooked options.I opted for sushi, so I could try the rice.  After the soup and salad, I was presented with a very simple but beautiful plate...with generous cuts of nigiri and the roll.  I received 2 pieces each of maguro (very deep red, beautiful), nama sake, and hamachi.  They were arranged in a colorful pattern.  I also got the spicy yellowtail roll as my roll choice.I was surprised honestly - the quality was definitely decent for our landlocked region and the rice was good.  I also got a green iced tea, which was served in a large glass, limiting any need for a refill.  Our server was very nice and quick.  We were in and out in under 35 minutes!  It is quiet inside and there is a cherry blossom painted on the back wall.  The ambiance is nice.  This is a definitely a good lunch spot on this side of town.I don't plan on coming back as they don't have AYCE option, yet their sushi is very much AYCE quality. I can understand places like Miko's not having AYCE because their menu is extensive and fish consistently fresh. The nigiri at this place was just mush, the rolls we had kept falling apart and the prices were on the higher side.When we first walked in, the restaurant was empty. I noticed the decor was very lovely and modern and I had high hopes that we had found a nice go to sushi joint near the house. As we are sitting down, my butt has not even touched the seat, much less looked at the drink menu the server asks what would we like to drink. "Uhhh...guess I'll start with water " is all I could say. I then ask if they have AYCE..she almost scoffs and says no. I think to myself, either this will be some bomb ass sushi or this woman is a delusional witch. It turned out to be the latter. As we are looking through the menu in the span of FIVE minutes she comes by at least 3 times asking if we had decided, increasingly annoyed each time. NO PRESSURE. Eventually we opt for baked mussels (pretty good), nigiri sampler (eight pcs of mushy old fish for $19.99)..oh that comes with a miso soup which I imagine salty bath water would taste like. Ex girlfriend roll ($14.95 and fell apart) and Tiger roll ($12.95..confusing... 5 of the 8 pcs had salmon on top, one pc had half salmon half nothing and the remaining two had "white tuna"). It took forever to get our last roll.... we were checked on once where a different server asked if I'd like my water refilled. At least we got the check and got out of there as quickly as possible. $60 down the drain. I think this place gets rave reviews because a) this is hendertucky and b)there are no other sushi joints in the vicinity. Poor service, poor quality of fish, no AYCE, and stupid prices.

Review Text :
Decent and inexpensive pizza. I chose HH's because, well, they were in my credit card's rewards program and I needed one more "dine" before the end of the year. I've been past this place lots of times and never thought to stop because of Luigi's.Today I got a medium "Howie Maui" which is their name for the classic Hawaiian pizza with pineapple and ham. Well topped with plenty of both, it was plenty hot and it didn't take long at all. I do like quick service!As far as the chain pizzas go, I would put Howie's ahead of Pizza Hut and far ahead of Domino's, maybe it's almost as good as Papa John's. But like so many things, pizza is a very personal choice. You likely feel different.If I'm ever looking for a variety of pizzas for a party or a lunch, I think Hungry Howie's would be a good choice. But if I was just looking for a slice, I'd look to Luigi's.Note: Some people drive this parking lot very quickly. Be careful.

Restaurant name  The Clark Bar
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
Clark Bar is a casual, neighborhood bar.  Don't expect much of a college scene here.  And because the bar is off the main strip for downtown Champaign, you won't find the modern urban socialite scene, either.  Most nights are relatively low-key, though they do host live music from time to time.   The place is deceptively large as rooms are sectioned off to allow for cozy, private settings for small groups.  I love to sit in their patio area in the summer, which also has a layout that allows for some privacy among groups, including a small screened porch (for people who fear insects).The alcohol selection here is probably not indie rock enough to impress beer elitists.  They offer standard beers and well drinks, but there are no obscure microbrews.For some confusing reason, Clark Bar is listed as a "tapas bar" on Yelp.  I think that this classification is somewhat misleading as tapas evoke a distinctly trendy, European sensibility.  While the tone of the food verges into tapas territory at times, the ambiance at Clark Bar probably wouldn't be suitable for an elegant dinner date.  The menu ranges from standard fare (burger and fries) to surprisingly exotic.  My carnivorous friends rave about the ribs, which are served exclusively on Wednesday and Friday.  Once I stopped by and found fried ALLIGATOR on the menu, an exceedingly rare delicacy outside of the deep south (ESPECIALLY in Champaign, IL).  Any appetizer they make with shrimp is absolutely perfect.  As a fair warning, some dishes are only offered seasonally.The variation you see in terms of food might also apply to the clientele you meet here.  Most nights the bars is populated by absolutely ordinary local people.  However, during one surreal visit, I watched as a stream of people dressed in Victorian hoop skirts and silk waistcoats marched in.  Not an experience you'd run across at most bars.  Apparently Clark Bar was hosting a meeting of the local steam punk club that evening.I'd recommend Clark Bar for anyone who isn't scared of a bar with a "townie" vibe.  This unassuming establishment serves some of the most interesting food in town, depending on the cook's mood.  For those who love to people-watch, there are fewer prime locations in the area.

Restaurant name  Napoli Pizzeria

Review Text :
First of all, this place left a menu in OUR mailbox...so it was perfect, we had a flight leaving at 6am and still have a ton of stuff to do to get ready for our flight.... So we gave Napoli a shot....TWO hours later and our pizza was still not delivered. We called to cxl an to say that was ridiculous and the girl just offers a discount and says that they are busy! Really? I have never waited 2 hours for ANY pizza. So did it take 2 hrs to actually get the pizza cooked or has it been sitting under a heat lamp for two hrs waiting for a delivery person? Don't solicit or leave your flyer at or even near my home if you can't deliver a flipping pizza in the proper amount of time.  I would never ever recommend this place.This place should rename themselves to orgasmic pizza or something of that nature. Thanks to my scooby doo crew down the street giving me the best referral a girl could ask for, aka this pizza spot, my mouth just had the priviledge of having a series of orgasms, one after another, all over my mouth and tongue!! The funny thing is... our local friend already knew this place and had ordered from them several times for one delicious pizza after another, just didn't know the name off hand, nor had he been to their location. Wooo! Yeah! So... there was three of us to feed and I didn't want there to be a shortage of pizza and/or us to be scavenging through the cupboards of our beloved friend's house late night tonight, so I wanted to go big, real big. I ordered the extra large pizza, aka 24 inches of pure pleasure (half pesto, half italian sausage) and a greek salad for the road. The salad was anything short of toppings and the pizza was so monsterous, we had to put it in the trunk of my SUV! We barely chipped away at half of it between the three of us. Crazy! Whoa-- the pie itself was ahhhhmazing. Dough made fresh, in-house and completely soft with a touch of browned/burntness around the edges. Another yelper said epic, I will have to second that notion. EPIC PIZZA to start off an EPIC HALLOWEEN. Their pizzas here are consistantly good (based on our temporary roomates reports) and never fall short of perfect. There was no shortage of staff to help the patrons and answer the phones as well.The dining area was small and casual, with lots of eye candy to browse around and look at. In other words there was nothing fancy about it, except the orgasmic pizza and the screamin' Greek Salad! :) The staff was exceptionally nice as well!Absolutely horrible experience. Quite possibly the rudest people I've ever met. I ordered $110 of pizza to be delivered. One pizza was dairy free due to food allergies. When it was delivered 1 hour ten minutes later 1/2 of the dairy free had cheese. When I called and asked for a credit they gave me two options. 1/2 half credit for the part that was incorrect or pick up the pizza and replace it in 30+ minutes. I asked for the manager and he was verbally abusive.  Did not acknowledge their mistake or the fact that they jeopardized my health with bad product. 15 minutes later the driver appeared to pick up the pizza saying they would replace it but I'd still be charged for the pizza.  Unbelievable. The other pizzas were wet and soggy. Extremely poor service and lousy product. Avoid this place. I called my credit card company and disputed the charges. I'm not paying for crappy food and abusive staff.

Did you know you could get healthy options at Pamela's? I sure didn't! Although I would love to stick my face in a plate of their Lyonnaise Potatoes, I'm trying to be good (snooze). I recently discovered their spinach and feta omelet, which I love, so I just health-ied it up with egg whites, whole wheat toast sans butter (because they tend to be heavy on the butta) and a side of fruit. And you know what? It was still tasty! I was even surprised how awesome the fruit was! It was a big bowl full of delicious banana's and strawberries! They also have turkey bacon and sausage. I was tempted to add that one, you know, for more protein, but I stuck with my little satisfying dish.This location is very tiny, so I'd strongly suggest going during off hours. I've been during peak and you wait forever! Plus, there's very limited parking on the side of the building. And most importantly, it's CASH ONLY, with no ATM for a couple blocks.So eat up, with loads of delicious calories or not!

Restaurant name  Erin's Snug Irish Pub
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
I was back in my hometown, Sun Prairie, for the Sweet Corn Festival. Good, small-town American fun. Our plan was to visit the Festival on Saturday. So, Friday Night, my Dad wanted to treat us to an All-You-Can-Eat Fish Fry. I asked him about Erin's Snug Irish Pub and if he had been there before. He hadn't, and in fact he had been wanting to try it out. What a perfect time to do this!Erin's isn't located in a residential area. It's in-between the build up of Madison & Sun Prairie. Right by American Family Insurance. Growing up, this was all farm fields. Now, you can't tell when Madison ends and Sun Prairie begins!  The outside of Erin's is fresh and crisp. Nice landscaping. Inside was a bit of a surprise for me. It's really nice. Woodsy décor. Beautiful rugs on the floor. Lot of little nooks and crannies to sit in besides the larger dining areas they have. Plus, a long bar with plenty of seating. The bar was busy, but the restaurant not so much. We got a table right away. It was a little too close to the bar, as for the noise level was high. Looking into the menu, I saw why the bar was so busy. Erin's has a Happy Hour that runs until 6 o'clock. We arrived just after 5:30, so when our server stopped by, we inquired about it. A buck off draft beers. 2 bucks off apps. Erin's has a good selection of beers and it wasn't hard for me to pick one out. A Wisconsin brown ale. Alyssa went with a Raspberry Tart from New Glarus. My Dad got a Long Island Iced Tea. My Ma, well, I can't remember. The menu is pretty well laid out. Lots of selections highlighting Irish Fare. The back page has all the daily specials. Friday tells me that the AYCE Fish Fry is served standard with Beer Battered Cod, Steak Fries, and Coleslaw for $13.99. That is exactly what my Dad & I got. Alyssa got a Rubin and my Ma got a Salmon Burger with Sweet Potato Fries.After ordering, our server brought us a bread basket. Fresh, hot, garlicky buns with soft butter. Boy. Those were good. We devoured them. Our wait for supper wasn't all too long. My supper came with two full fillets of lightly battered Cod, a large pile of Steak Fries, a medium sized ramekin of colorful Coleslaw, and a small ramekin of Tartar & a lemon wedge. I squeezed the lemon on my fillets and took a dip into the tartar sauce.  Solid taste. Batter isn't thick. Too much lemon might make your Cod a bit soggy. The tartar was really good. Seemed to be house made. It was chunky with dill pickle. The Steak Fries aren't a favorite of mine. I personally don't think they go well with a Fish Fry. They are called Steak Fries for a reason. right? To go with Steak? I think a Fish Fry should get the skinny Fries. The Coleslaw was fantastic. Again, seemed to be house made. Purples & oranges mixed in. Great cutter into all the fried food bites.Our server was alright in checking back in with us. I was able to get a few more pieces. I shared with Pheona and gave a bite to Alyssa. Her Rubin was good. I got a bite of it. The bread didn't get soggy, as some Rubin's do. The cost isn't justified of this Fish Fry. $13.99 is way to high. Reason being: You don't get any selection. No choice of side or Cod. A Baked Cod would be nice. I'm happy we tried this place out, and will be back to have a drink. But $13.99? C'mon Erin's. For that cost, let me choose what kind of potato I get with it. Overall, the food was good. But not $13.99 good. The ambiance is nice, but loud. This is a place worth checking out. There's a little something for everyone.

Review Text :
Poli is a little different than some of the other ~bertos places, with a bit of variety in the menu and a bunch of quality in the food.The place is clean and the booths are quite cushy and comfortable.It was good, but fuhDANGah i can't be loose enough to give 'em more than a 4.0The Carnitas taco was great.  (that's pork for the gringos and recent transplants) It came in full size, not tiny, soft corn tortillas, with roasted pork chunks covered in a drizzle of "guac-like sauce / saucy guac" and some pico de gallo.  The pork was standout - tasty and tender and not dry at all.The Pollo (chicken, Guero!) taco was good, as well, but not the best I've had.  Shredded chicken was moist, sure, but this stuff is always precooked and waiting in a watery broth to be tong'd out into a waiting shell, so not too hard to be decent.  Poli's was average to good in the meat, generous with lettuce and cheese, but the hard corn shell was not the right consistency and crumbled into my hand as i ate.There was a Carne Asade Nacho (grilled meat and chips, Pan Blanco!) plate that was about a foot in diameter and about a third as high.  It looked impressive, but the meaty bit I sampled had a wierd taste -- good at first, but then almost 'fishy' later.  Who knows. 8^ |NQI Napkin Quality Index : poor, not the worst i've encountered, but only a 2 star napkin experience, as best.I will be making more return visits, but this does not earn the title of the best hole in the wall mexican joint from me.  (A title a Somethingberto's near you is wishing hard that they had!)

Review Text :
Eddie's Place is as homely of a restaurant as you can try.  The no-frills Cotswold location has a wait staff with character and hearty food.  I'm pretty much sold on those points.I've been a few times and I've had their Greek Cheese steak-it's like a gyro on steroids!  Filled with lamb and beef, this gyro is hard to bet.  I'm not a fan of the fries however-they were "chipped" fried potato pieces without much substance.  The other sides are worthwhile however.  The staff are an absolute riot-I got "jostled" by my waiter for my indecisiveness.  Still, its a laid-back atmosphere and it certainly appears that the staff enjoy their job.  Our server was out to check on us regularly and we felt much love.  I'm going back to Eddie's at some point. The menu has some interesting treats, like Cajun dishes and really down-home dishes that I haven't seen in restaurants.  The beverage selection is top-notch, he-llo!

Review Text :
After a long, long day of meetings, our work associates hosted dinner at La Colombe. All I can tell you is they have seriously good taste.  I enjoyed the most sumptuous meal I've had in a long time.It's a small, one room place, with a simple, french-inspired menu of  "cuisine du marche" or "cuisine of the market". And it's fixed price, no matter what course selections you make; though appetizers are extra.I wasn't starving, so I went for a simple beet and greens salad to start. My entree was leg of lamb, and it was the best I've ever had...in my life: falling off the bone and perfectly seasoned, over a bed of what appeared to be black-eyed peas in bacon-infused sauce (I don't exactly know what it was, except Good).  Dessert was a perfect blueberry tart with a matching cup of perfect coffee.La Colombe is BYOB. Our associates had taken care of this as well. Did I mention their good taste? They brought quite a bit of excellent wine, and they didn't seem to want to have any left over.  It was a good thing I took a cab.

Review Text :
I enjoyed my lunch meeting at Daily Dose today... and I will definitely return, but I can't bring myself to give more than three stars just yet.The location is extremely convenient and despite a ton of Spring Training Game Day traffic, I found a prime spot right around the corner from DD.  Score!Since I beat my companion to the restaurant, I had a few moments to peruse the menu.  There is plenty to choose from and it all sounds delicious! There were a few salads that I was looking at and then I saw that they had fresh crabmeat as a salad topper, and I was sold on the spinach, avocado, grapefruit salad with crabmeat and a cilantro lime dressing.  My companion had a cobb salad with chicken.  I have to say, service was incredibly slow - both in acknowledging us and getting our drinks, and getting our food once we'd ordered... and then, even slower when we were ready to pay the check.  Hence the main reason I'm giving three stars instead of four.But, I will say the salad I had was delicious  -  the perfect light and healthy lunch.  I can't wait to go back and order it again.  The breakfast choices are awesome too.  Just make sure you give yourself plenty of time if you're dining in.DD is moderately priced... it would have been under $30 out the door without my crabmeat ($6.95 additional for that).  If the website that is on their business cards were updated, you would be able to see just how many menu items there are that you'd like to try too!  Hopefully they will get that done soon...One more perk of Daily Dose: they have patio seating!  Go now before it gets too hot!As they say, "trust your gut" - your gut instinct is usually right... and while it's time for a DD update, it seems my gut instinct is still right on with this one.Sine my initial visit, I've been to DD a handful of times, mostly out of convenience.  While my rating is staying the same, I will say that Daily Dose is consistent... they provide satisfactory food and service every time!  Portions are generous and the food is good; it just never blows me away... One fun fact for you new moms out there: Daily Dose has a very large bathroom area with plenty of room to change your baby's diaper if necessary - I believe there were even diapers and wet wipes provided.  (This is probably because the owner has a little one).  I'm not at that stage of my life yet, so don't get any ideas, but good to know for those that are!The Beautiful Carin invited me to accompany her to church this morning after power yoga at the Village...how could I say no? :-)I am her "arm candy" in those kinds of social situations...and in fact, I cannot cross over the transom of the church, unless we are holding hands...I have an unfortunate tendency to spontaneously combust when I try to enter a church on my own:)But we held hands and I safely navigated the inner sanctums of Scottsdale Bible Church this morning:)But, I didn't get a chance to retox immediately after my workout and running on nothing but coffee, I was starving by the time the preacher said "Amen, Go forth", etc.We were looking for someplace kind of close to the house, with a varied menu (we took Carin's mom, the Lovely Lynn, out for lunch after church today, so we were looking for a bit more than chicken and waffles:)I suggested we give Daily Dose another go.Carin had not been here before, nor had Lynn, so there we were:)We were met at the door by the owner, Jenn-Lyn (also of Fusion, although she informed me that they closed Fusion a few weeks ago...sadly:(...but, on a positive note, the closing of Fusion seems to have allowed them to focus on DD, because, the everything is much better than the last time I was there, and they were quite busy:)Drinks and menus' arrived right away, the service was friendly and accommodating and Carin and her mom were just delighted with the menu selections, the service and the ambiance of the place, and I agree...it's a pleasant spot:)I decided to try something other than a burger today and am I glad that I did:)I had a sandwich called the "Old Town Stack...shaved prime rib, gruyere cheese and red cabbage slaw on the sandwich...inventive and very tasty!Carin and Lynn had the Chopped Southwestern Salad and the Spinach Citrus Salad, respectively...they pronounced the salads delicious and the salads were also huge (we ended up taking  1/2 of each home).They made my girls happy, and I am here to tell you, if your wife and mother-in-law are happy, you are going to be happy:)I love getting the chance to give another star to nice people for real improvement!The DD is a solid 4 stars and solidly in the Old Town rotation:)What a great breakfast spot!  Came here for a quick one yesterday before heading over to work for our complimentary annual flu shot and work after.  The weather was delightful enough that I toyed with the idea of dining outside, but wasn't sure if smoking was allowed (I don't smoke).  I decided to dine in at the counter, but did find out that smoking isn't allowed in all dining areas, at least not in Scottsdale!  I'll have to try patio-dining with friends soon.Had ordered the biscuits and gravy platter, which came with herbed potatoes and fruit, but all I really wanted was a biscuit and gravy, and soon spotted it among the sides menu and cancelled the original.  My only complaint during yesterday's experience was that I felt my server had pressured me into ordering more than I had wanted to.  I'd asked if their gravy was chunky since most of the places that boast "sausage gravy" LIE, and she assured me that I'd love their chunky gravy, so I knew not to order a side of sausage patties, but she had asked me more than three times if I wanted to order two sides, so I thought of trying the bacon, but decided against it when my inquiry of whether or not it contained corn syrup and celery juice came back positive.  So I went with the patties.  There wasn't a need to order more meat as the side of B&G is ample enough for little young me :)  [This dish kept me going for almost six hours!]I loved this spicy breakfast item so much, I came back for more this morning!  I literally bumped into an old friend, at the Mayo Clinic of all places!, and we thought it'd be nice catch up during breakfast afterwards.  I arrived earlier and placed my order in for a biscuit and gravy ($3.95) and one stuffed pancake ($2.95).  I chose the peach creme brulee.  (This was going to be a treat as I haven't had peaches in three years!)  No powdered sugar, please, and FYI, the pancake syrup here isn't 100% maple.  My friend, who exercises and counts calories as much as I do, was going to look at the pancake list when I, recalling he liked egg-white omelets, told him that DD offered an egg-white wrap.  He instantly ordered this, but also ordered a blueberry and banana pancake made w/ honey whole wheat.  (I'd lamented that the server hadn't asked me for my batter preference, so my pal said he'd order one with whole wheat, for me to try.  A pleasant double-surprise was when he chose blueberries and banana, the latter which I haven't eaten in three years!)He absolutely loved his egg-white wrap.  I almost tried a bite, but didn't want to play with fire since I was already trying my luck with the peaches and the banana.  (The wrap contained eggs and mushrooms...)  I loved both of the pancakes- the peach creme brulee was perfect w/out any added butter or syrup, but my friend's pancake needed a little maple syrup.  Thank goodness I always carry some, just in case!  =)Can't wait for that upcoming UYE a yelper teased about during our jaunt at Haus Murphy's ;)10/24Couldn't wait till a Friday UYE at DD, so I opted to go on my own and try the Daily Dose Kobe burger and sweet potato fries at happy hour prices ($5, plus a $1.50 upcharge for any side dish substitution other than their hand-cut fries or regular fries).  It's not 100% Kobe, but Daily Dose's "own house blend of Kobe and beef burger patty."  I asked my server to have the sweet potato fries cooked extra-crispy, and she assured me that their way of preparing them made them very crispy.  I also ordered a glass of Cab ($5).Loved the two pieces of thick-cut pepper-smoked bacon!  Their crispiness lent the Kobe-beef burger a much-needed textural component it greatly lacked, or so I thought.  (I'm a huge fan of the "crust" that cooking on flat-tops and grills impart on food, be they cuts of meat, stone fruits, bread, or veggies!)  I enjoyed the harissa aioli on top of the aged cheddar, but I wished that the pretzel bun spent more time in the oven/grill.  The sweet potato fries were very unsatisfactory.  I would definitely order it extra-extra crispy, or I may just try the chorizo mac 'n cheese next time I go.  The Gladiator burger ($5.50, plus fries) is calling my name...Thanks to Donald and Carin for sponsoring this wonderful event! Just got back and it was a lot of fun. Great food and drink not to mention the company - shoutouts to Jim and Kevin ... I also commend the waitstaff highly for their friendliness and extreme competence in handling the many and varied orders of 25+ people with grace and efficiency.Just as a side note, I was also taken with the (XTREME?) hand dryers in the bathroom, which told me at the spout to FEEL THE POWERThat about says it all.Thanks again and best wishes for the season!Holy cow.  I could be a Hindu if only the method of worshipping was eating the object of worship.(which I guess makes my true natural religion Vulvan, but that's another story)   `,8^ }The Half Priced, Half Kobe, Half Chuck, Happy Hour Daily Dose Burger was Wholly delicious.   The pretzel-bread bun just took it over the top.The rest of the menu looked thoughtfully prepared, and a brief conversation with one of the principals confirmed the serious attitude with which they take their establishment.The staff handling our patio party was to be heartily commended.  The server was actually remembering and calling most everyone at the table by their first name!The empty plates and beer bottles never lingered long, and the cucumber slice infused (i'll never enjoy lemon-water quite as much again, this stuff was so refreshing!) water glasses were never empty.Perhaps the wonderful company of multiple yelpers and the genuine conversation had me in a bit of an in-clover stupor, but I left Daily Dose with a feeling of fulfillment that went far beyond my belly.Special thanks Donald for the set-up, and Carin's parents for being so hip and cool!Daily Dose Definitively Delivered Downright Deliciousness.While sitting on the patio with a fubar of Yelpers I kept seeing the "DD" logo with it's overlapping D's and red background and thinking it looked really familiar.  Isn't that the logo for the Marvel comic DareDevil?  You remember that right?  Occasional guest in the Spiderman series, subject of yet another godawful Ben Affleck movie?  That DareDevil?So these folks provided outstanding service (Thanks Tina!-she remembered every person by first name and even caught on when I was trying to slip my charges under Brian's name) and excellent food!  The Yelper special was a great bonus!  Thanks to Donald S for hooking up the UYE and the special with the owner!  I'm sure we made up for any loss from the special with lots of alcohol.The burger (.5 Kobe beef, .5 high quality other beef) was really good and the pretzel style bun was a nice touch.3/2, 3/9, & 4/16Took Mom w/ me for breakfasts twice and then (finally!) tried the $2 tacos on Taco Mondays.  Aja (brekky) and Ashley (dinner), our servers, are always delightful.  They're both warm and friendly (and both pretty, too!), and, most importantly, they patiently listen and retrieve the info I need should I require it.  (I have to contend w/ numerous food allergies, it isn't funny.*)  Breakfasts consisted of the ham benedict and the Rosemary Steak and Eggs.  The benedict's hollendaise sauce was silky-smooth, and not too heavy-- it had a nice mouth-feel to it.  The eggs that laid beneath the sauce were perfectly cooked!  They were a beauty to behold, and even more enchanting to bite through...  Have I mentioned I liked food w/ good mouth-feel??  The slices of ham, while very lovely to look at, were too salty for my taste.  (Mom concurred.)  The DD hash, made w/ caramelized butternut squash, sauteed mushrooms, and caramelized onions, was good, but Mom preferred the country potatoes, and I'll have to agree.  I really like perfectly cooked butternut squash, and alas, the squash preparation here has consistently been hit-or-miss (either not cooked enough or too mushy), but the country potatoes are always a hit!  Perfectly seasoned and browned every time.  Perhaps we would've enjoyed the meal better had we swapped out the muffin and hollendaise sauce for a biscuit and some sausage gravy (DD still serves the best biscuits and gravy I've ever had!).  It's nice to know that this option is always available in any of the benedict dishes!  The rosemary steak and eggs platter was a disappointment.  First, we had to send the steak back, as it was definitely cooked to well-done (we prefer medium rare to medium), but no worries, this was quickly remedied.  Ten minutes later, we were able to try our first bites.  Eh, nothing special.  (Leftover steak was less flavorful, moreover.  What a waste!)  Eggs were a bit scorched on the outside and too runny inside- we asked for over-medium.  (If I want scorched and runny eggs, I can cook them myself at home!  Hehe.  Actually, I make great fried eggs!)  Thank goodness that the toast was delightful, but, in the end, who wants to walk away knowing they paid $20 for, literally, toast and coffee?  BTW, the coffee here is very weak.  We haven't ordered another cup since the initial attempt, and should we try again, we'll have to see if they'll brew a stronger batch just for us.  (Hey, other venues have done so, and quite 5-stars of  them, too!)  So, breakfasts at DD that week weren't too successful, but we'll keep going back for the creme brulee and banana-blueberry pancakes (try the gingerbread batter!), as well as the awesome sausage and biscuits (the chunky sausage chipotle cream sauce is to-die-for!!).I can't believe I waited this long to try the $2 taco special on Mondays!  We tried all four varieties (carne asada, and one each of the crunchy and grilled chicken, and chorizo), and Mom and I liked the carne asada the best (we ordered two)!  I liked all but the grilled chicken, of which I had a bite, but Mom enjoyed it.  If you have an avocado allergy, be sure to let the staff know, and double-check your order, as well, to make sure that the guac is delivered on-the-side.  (The second carne asada arrived w/ the guac in the taco...) DD serves up good guac.  Trust me, I suffered through days of pain and lethargy to be able to say this is true.  Try it w/ any of the wraps, if it doesn't already accompany it!*I don't let the issue keep me from a fave activity of mine, though, as some anonymous "Yelpers" have suggested.  I actually use it to my advantage when dining out, as it aids me w/ finding quality venues and the staff that help keep consumers such as myself coming back again and again.Kobe hamburger with pretzel bread. That's all you need to know! Yeah, I'm a fan! I visited Daily Dose on Whiskey Wednesday. That means $5 whiskeys. After one of those, I just had to eat something! Well, hello Kobe burger! I chose the Daily Dose burger which 8oz is topped with cheddar & jack, peppered bacon, fresh basil, shaved onion, tomato & harissa aioli on a toasted pretzel bun! Whew! The burger was tasty and the pretzel bun was a master stroke. The meat was juicy and cooked to order (medium for me). The toppings added to the flavor of the burger and the pretzel bun was chewy and salted just like a YUMMY pretzel. I was a happy girl! I hope to visit Daily Dose for breakfast, maybe a lunch! I hope they can wow me like they did before!After so many review updates, I usually cease to write more unless I have something really noteworthy to add (a new menu addition or fave dish, or great customer service rendered, etc).  Unfortunately, I will have to say that this morning's breakfast of biscuits and gravy and a platter of peach creme brulee pancakes didn't have us leaving w/ happy stomachs :(  There were a couple of hitches, but these were easily amended.  (I think my love affair of DD's biscuit and gravy has ended.)  My major gripe was that our gingerbread pancakes did not contain candied ginger pieces-- did Daily Dose switch to a new mix/formulation?  If yes, please switch back!  The pancakes we had today were too dense and not at all the flavorful-spicy and texturally-exciting cakes we've had in the past :(  The peach creme brulee sauce also didn't arrive warmed, and instead was squeezed unappetizingly onto a sauce dish.  The leftovers that I usually get to enjoy again on one of my work breaks ended up in the trash.I'm going to go back again soon to give DD another try... I'd like to keep it on my list of fave brekky places!This was a great spot to grab some much needed breakfast sustenance after a night of drinking and partying all night long in the Arizona desert!We were seated very quickly and had our food come to us very quickly as well which was totally awesome because I was hungry!They have a menu that was full of delicious options but the Hangover Sandwich definitely caught my eye for being one of the best things they had to serve.The sandwich itself was oh soooo good packed with a flavor of grilled jalapeños, onions, eggs and breakfast meats what more could you ask for?The sandwich also came with a fruit cup and some potatoes all of which were quite good and went well with the flavor of the sandwich.This is definitely a place I would come to again for breakfast if I was in the area great selection and the Breakfast Bacon Bloody Mary sounded amazing as well if your into that kinda thing like I am!After our RnR visit was a fail, we settled for Daily Dose and I am glad we did!My study group and I were going to have study session Sunday, but in order to get our thinking caps on, we needed food first.We were seated at a high top table and greeted by our waitress promptly. We ordered two bloody Mary's and a lame-o ordered a diet coke. I chose the Bloody Mary with cucumber vodka upon the servers recommendation. Boy, did she screw me over...it wasn't good. Actually, even the regular one wasn't good. So..I got a michelada! YAS! which was so much better!Food time! As our appetizer, we ordered the chicken nachos...BEST NACHOS EVER!!! so many ingredients, and cheese ( I LOVE cheese!), and this cheese sauce that was a little spicy but so good! mmmmm! I got the turkey sausage omelet and added mushrooms to it. It came with a side of seasons potatoes and your choice of butternut squash hash, cottage cheese, or fruit. Well I asked for the servers recommendation (I am extremely indecisive), and she said the butternut squash was good. Once again, she screwed me over because I hated it. Everything else was excellent! The potatoes had the perfect amount of seasoning and were cooked to a crisp. The omelet was exploding with flavor. I don't remember what my friends got but they were pretty happy with their choices. We were all in food coma shortly after. Our plates were not even half eaten before we stopped eating because it was THAT much food. As much as we hated to stop eating, we had to or else the rest of the day would have been bad.The prices are really good here! So much food for like $10.00! Cant beat that! Service was good, I just wish my server had better taste in food.I will be coming back fa sho!

If you have ever lived in or traveled through a rural area, the number one rule for finding a good restaurant is to look for the parking lot that is full. Look for the parking lot that has the farmers trucks, the police cars or the fire trucks. When you find this place, you have found the best place in town. Don't worry when you drive by this place that it looks like a little SHACK!!  Because that is just what it is. A place so small and off to the side of the road that if you aren't looking for it, you would miss it. A place so small that if you do see it, you would never think to stop. But if you do venture to try this small shack of a restaurant, you are in for a treat. Jim's Burros offers a small menu of more typical burritos and tacos. They offer a limited breakfast menu, but offer it all day long. And have a daily .99 cent menu item. My favorite... Taco Tuesday... Ground beef tacos on hard shells. Six usually does the trick for me. But that still gets me out the door for less than $7.00. Jim's Burros provides a great food, at an exceptional prices. Most items run less than $6.00. Take Out takes less than 10 minutes. Call ahead and your food is usually ready by the time you get there... I live 5 minutes away and my order is always ready by the time I arrive. If you do Take Out, spend the extra couple of bucks and get a large side of salsa also. It saves well and is better than anything you will ever find in the store. Want a change, try the Chili Reno. A large green chili wrapped in egg and smothered in green chili sauce. This is not an appetizer, this baby is huge. Want a traditional breakfast? Pancakes are so huge that three are two large to for me to finish. Omelette's that are filling. And breakfast burritos that are huge. Again, all for less than about $5.00. Eat In, you get chips and salsa at the table while you wait. Just a perfect taste waiting for the meal. My only complaint.... They are not open on Sunday. This would be perfect for breakfast burrito take out on Sunday morning for Sunday football. If you make it to Queen Creek area, look for the small shack on the side of the road. They have added signs and store decorations to make it more visible. So don't be afraid. It might be a hole in the wall place, but you won't regret it...Remember, if you live in the community, always support your local places. Good restaurants that are just around the corner are few and far between.  So forget the chain places like Filberto's that seem to have popped up everywhere, support the local businesses!!!This is really hard for me. Really, really hard. I have been eating here since the place opened, have loved it. Recently, things have been changing. Ingredients, prices, items on the menu. Food has gotten bland, expensive, and on this last trip has made me sick for going on five days now. I do not believe that the kitchen staff is handling meats the correct way, thus giving me food poisoning. Jims, if you are reading this, STOP! You guys were AWESOME. Go back to quality ingredients not crap we can buy in the frozen section at Frys. Stop changing the menu. Stop increasing your prices while decreasing your costs by using cheap ingredients. Have some pride in your work again. Bacon is supposed to be crispy and fried, not limp and tasting like it came from a microwave. I will not even comment on the burrito that made me sick because it will just put me back in the bathroom. When something is good, don't change it. I cannot tell you I will be back here again, food poisoning is not something I an inclined to risk again. I would sure hate to see the place close down, but you make your other regulars sick, they likely won't be coming back either.

The hot dog and fries were very good! Hubby is the burger eater and scarfed down his.It seems a lot of people are always come into this location by foot when I am here. Sometimes there are just groups of people sitting outside eating Tommy's. There isn't a table people just sit on the curb or near the side of walmart. I always wonder if I am missing out on something or avoiding something shady. This isn't my favorite of the NV Tommy's locations but the food is consistent and the workers are very friendly so when working on this side of town it hits the spot.  I haven't tried their breakfast yet we always make it for lunch or dinner!.. :)LAST TOMMY 'S WAS 25 YEARS AGOHamburger with chili no cheese. Momo didn't even share with Yu-go. Hot dog with chili, onions, cheese, pickles and tomatoes ...larger than life, smothered with dripping chili topped with large sliced condimentsChili fries ...piping hot!

Restaurant name  J & G Steakhouse

Review Text :
Located on the fifth floor at the Phoencian resort, J&G Steakhouse is a dark, open, sophisticated space. If your schedule is flexible, I would recommend dining around sunset to get that extra ambiance. However, even at 8 pm (that is the time we had reservations), the twinkling lights in the distance gave an extra romantic feel.My husband and I decided to have a date night on Friday night, and we chose J&G since it was Restaurant Week and we had been wanting to try it. As most other reviews have said, the service is incredibly lacking and is only 2 stars. Luckily the food is exceptional and pretty much makes you forget how poor the service is that you are receiving. We both ordered the RW menu - I had the caesar salad, parmesan crusted chicken, and the chocolate cake with caramel ice cream. The caesar salad was very fresh and for an appetizer was quite large. The chicken was the highlight for me. You get two nice sized chicken breasts (I could only eat 3/4 of one because they were so large)...the chicken was so incredibly moist. Plus the parmesan crust on the chicken gave it an upscale fried chicken feel and had a hint of saltiness to it which I loved. The chocolate cake was sinful - once you broke into the cake, there was molten chocolate inside which was complimented perfectly by the ice cream. My husband loved all of his food (tomato soup, hanger steak with fries, apple tart) and even shared the french fries that came with his steak with me (the fries were salty and delicious). With our entrees, we also ordered a side of the mashed potatoes which were amazing. They were so smooth and had just the right amount of butter in them. I only wish the side had been bigger because we argued over who got the last scoop!For a beer, two RW menus, and a side of mashed potatoes, our bill before tip came to $79 which we thought was great. For a nice, resort steakhouse, the prices on the regular J&G menu are incredibly reasonable and we are already planning another trip back to try more items on the menu!9/23Had a friend meet me here for Restaurant Week.  We both weren't dressed for the Phoenician, but I didn't care (and soon, he didn't either).  It's a good thing, too, bec. in the end, we found that this place wasn't ostentatious nor that pretentious.  Dressed casually, we still managed to have a good time, despite the overall lackluster dining experience.First off, let me say that the service could pick up their heels a bit.  By the time we received our expensive alcoholic beverage choices, more than 20 minutes had elapsed.  ($15 for a glass of Cab and $11 for a tiny glass of mimosa?  Are you serious??)  Our first plate, a sub-par Caesar salad, arrived close to an hour after we were seated.  But perhaps the fault wasn't entirely J&G's... Digestif's Caesar salad pretty much demolished all other competitors, I'd say.  How about I testify that tonight's salad was crispy.  That's saying something nice, right?  No flavor, no creamy eggy goodness, but somewhat crispy.  The decimated croutons didn't help the situation...For the entree, we had the skirt-steak & frites.  The latter weren't any better than what you would find at McDonalds'.  (Seriously, I'm not making this up.  Just check out the photos and you'll see I'm all about the truth!)  But the skirt steak!  This baby wasn't much to gaze at, but it was tasty.  Let's just say it was delicious enough for me not to cry over the expense we spent that night on a barely-touched salad, a cheap cut of steak, three beverages, and tip.  Now onto the star of the show... chocolate cake w/ caramel ice cream!  Wait for it... homemade caramel ice cream!  And chocolate-lava cake shaped like a star.  Oh. My. Freakin'. God.  This should be renamed "Foreplay."  Nice ambience, despite it being darker than I would like and that we were seated far away from the panoramic views.  I appreciated the privacy, though.  Women's restroom was clean and orderly, and walking past little caches of wine bottles was a nice touch.  The grounds looked pretty, but I was more impressed w/ the property at The Arizona Grand...J & G = my husband's and my first initials.  For that reason alone, I've been wanting to try this Steakhouse.  The menu is created by Michelin starred Chef, Jean-Georges Vongerichten.  The restaurant resides atop the high end Phoenician Resort.  And I've heard many a good review about this place.  Unfortunately, my expectations were too high; my experience at J & G was mediocre.Our team of servers led by Justis was not the problem, the service was fine.  And the drinks were decent too... I especially was happy with my extra dirty Goose martini - it was as big as my head and went down smooth.  But the food was not worth the money!  The rolls they serve don't compare to the popovers at BLT or the bread basket at Mastro's.  The Caesar salad didn't have much flavor.  The Rib eye  steak, while a nice portion, was dry and lacked typical rib eye flavor.  The Chilean Sea Bass was just ok... and I typically love sea bass, especially when it's prepared with a miso-yuzu broth, but I've had better.  And while I didn't try the sweet and sour pork belly, the guys at our table left half of it uneaten.  That's gotta say something.On the other hand, our party of five enjoyed the oyster appetizer and the family style sides (roasted mushrooms, steamed broccoli, and creamed spinach).  We also enjoyed the ambiance, the beautiful view, and the desserts.  My favorite was the carrot cake but we also tried an apple tart and the chocolate lava cake.Bottom line - it really comes down to the food... If you're looking for an incredible steak house, there are a handful of others I'd recommend before J & G.Friday night was going to be burger night; we were going to go to Relish Burger Bistro, the new restaurant at the Phoenician Clubhouse... (and I was going to get the FTR), but there were no outdoor tables when we arrived, and while the menu was appealing, sitting inside was not, so we decided to head back to J & G to give them another shot.We lucked out at J & G and were given a prime table outside with incredible views... it was me, Jared, my brother, and my parents, and it was a beautiful night!  I was exhausted as I came from an afternoon of drinking and hanging out at both the Giants Spring Training game and The Lodge... but I woke up for the meal that was ahead of me.  I drank water but my dad went for the Elderberry Specialty Cocktail and really enjoyed it and my mom had a couple of drinks too... oh, and my bro had a Steamworks beer!Justis was our server again, and we had several other staff members catering to our every need including an extremely friendly GM.  The fresh bread was better than I remembered from our previous visit.  I started with the wedge salad (and so did my dad and brother).  We were all extremely pleased as the salads were chilled just right, the lettuce was fresh and crisp, and had the perfect balance of tomato, crispy bacon, and blue cheese dressing.  We also shared some appetizers for the table including Crispy Calamari, Parmesan Risotto, and Warm Beets.I went with the Crab Cake for my entree... much better than the sea bass I had previously during my first visit.  Served with avocado, cucumber, and a sweet sauce, the serving size was plenty, and it was delicious!  The texture was crispy on the outside, and warm and creamy on the inside.  I also dug into the sides that we shared at the table including asparagus, creamed spinach, roasted mushrooms, and french fries that came with the burgers... (my mom, J, and Z had burgers).  My dad really enjoyed his Veal Porterhouse.  And as if we weren't full enough, we shared a few desserts.  My favorite was still the Carrot Cake and everyone else loved the Apple Tart.And as I'm typing this review, I'm smiling just thinking about what a memorable night we had at J & G... I'm really happy we gave them another shot!  The other funny thing I'm smiling about is that I just wrote about the menu items we had and that I would recommend, and I think they are getting ready to change their menu... we were told they do so on a quarterly basis.  I just hope that the new Spring menu is as good if not better than the one we had on Friday.  And I hope that our future visits will continue to be five stars as well.  As the saying goes, "you never get a second chance to make a first impression," but in this case, I'm glad we gave J & G a second chance - and I bet they are too... after all, I'm bumping my rating up from three stars to five!  Thanks J & G!Simply delicious. That's how I describe J & G Steakhouse. Not only is the food delicious, but the atmosphere is quite perfect as well! J & G Steakhouse sits atop the Phoenician and overlooks the Valley. Every seat in the house is excellent with a window view and it's a perfect setting for a romantic date or a special dinner. In addition to the dining room, the lounge is perfect to sit and enjoy a couple cocktails as well! The food here is delicious and everything I would expect from J & G Steakhouse. We recently stopped by to try out the neighborhood menu special which is quite simply, a steal. For $39 a person, you order from a prix fixe three course meal that includes an appetizer, entree and dessert. I started with the split grilled shrimp salad which had a delectable dressing to go with it. For my entree, I enjoyed the flat iron steak with BBQ sauce. The steak was cooked perfectly and a tasty combination of tender and juicy. We ended up having a medley of dessert and each one was more delicious then the next! I decided that you really can't go wrong with any dessert here, or really any item from the menu for that matter, it all just depends on your taste bud's likings. This is on the list of one of my favorite steak houses in the Valley and it's because of beautiful atmosphere and delicious food combined. If you have a loved one, want to woo a date or simply want to have a special night out on the town, I highly suggest J & G Steakhouse! For a more budget-friendly evening, check out their neighborhood menu from 5-7 PM nightly through September!400th Review!!!!!!!!I have been dying to try J & G Steakhouse for a very long time, and when I saw there was a group of Yelpers going to try them out during the fall restaurant week I knew this was my chance!  1st off, let's talk about the amazing view, you can see for miles, I honestly didn't want to leave, just wanted to watch the city lights twinkle and soak up the view!For restaurant week, J&G offered a few choices, for me, I went to a steakhouse, so gosh darnit I'm having me some steak!! hahaI started with an arugula & boston lettuce salad with a mustard vinaigrette, now if you don't care of the bitter taste of the arugula, then this salad is not for you, but for me, everything blended perfectly.   I ordered the prime top sirloin cap which also came with a broccoli purée and some roasted garlic & chili flakes on the side, now the broccoli purée on its own tasted very wheat grassy green, if that makes since but the waiter told us to spinkle the garlic chili flakes over the steak and mix the steak with the purée, and OMG AMAZING!!!! The flavors all complement each other! Next thing I knew my steak was gone!! So good!!!   Ended my meal with caramel ice cream and a warm chocolate molten cake, omg so good!!! Love the combination of caramel and chocolate, had I not been at the J&G I'm pretty sure I would have licked my plate clean (not really, but yes it's that good).Enjoyed my evening at J&G and with the company I was with, amazing views, great service, and excellent food! Hope to be back soon!I really wanted to like this place after having such a great time and fantastic cocktails during the Yelp Cocktail society.  Alas, the experience came out to be a 3 star average for me.First of all, this place is beautiful on the inside.  As you walk in, you first notice that it is clean and modern with a sexy South Beach kind of feel to it.  I got the immediate feeling that beautiful people come here and stay and come back.  As you round the corner of the hostess stand, you see the spectacular view.  A beautiful view.  I'm still kicking myself that I had not come here before the Yelp Coctail society earlier this summer.  I recommend to anyone coming here to please go just before sunset so you can appreciate the stellar view this restaurant provides.We were seated right by the window with a clear panoramic view facing southeast of the Valley.  We were greeted by our server and ordered a few drinks.  We were not in any rush, this was a b'day dinner/celebration for me, so it was a casual happy event for us.  This is where things kind of went down hill.....The server must have had too many tables to wait on.  He had some support staff, but we waited for very long intervals between ordering drinks, appetizers and dinner.  I generally don't like that.  And my friend, who is not easily irritated, even noticed how long it was taking the server to come back.So, we finally order our meal.  We decided to go for the 32oz bone in Australian Wagyu Ribeye for 2 that was to be sliced table side.  Cool,  a huge piece of meat, cooked Medium Rare.   We order the sides.  Our steak comes out and... its pretty much just shy of being cold.  Definitely not warm.  We are perplexed by it  to be honest, but one thing that worked in their favor, the time we waited to place our order... and with us both practically starving.. NEITHER one of us would have sent it back - at least the sides were hot!  ha!  so, I ate my steak and kept my mouth shut.  The steak itself taste good.  Just the temperature of it was wrong.For dessert, they brought out the obligatory b'day cake.  A molten chocolate cake.  Unfortunately, that was the LAST thing I wanted to have.  I had had so much molten chocolate cake on my vacation the week before, that anyone else's cake would have HAD to be flawless for me to enjoy it, there's wasn't.  not enough chocolate and it tasted like it was not made with any salt.  Also it wasn't very sweet.  so... YIKES.  I'm giving them a 3 star review largely because I expect something better out of a restaurant in which 2 people spend $250+ on dinner.

Review Text :
Third time is the charm...still great and consistent! If you are in the mood for sushi during "off peak" hours (e.g., in between lunch and dinner), Yama is open! I was starting to get hungry around 3pm and I tried 3 different places and by the time I arrived at each place they were closed between lunch and dinner. I guess I was meant to eat at Yama.This could be one of the best sushi places in Charlotte.  I have been here three times now, and have yet to be disappointed.  The staff is friendly and they are more than willing to change a tv to your game of preference.  The best part?  If you order enough sushi, they will bring it out on a boat.  Definitely impressive.  They have all sorts of special rolls that they make, with descriptions on the menu.  As well as the typical assortment of nigiri.The atmosphere is very classy, but you could definitely go in jeans.  They also have a bar area.  I think the fusion comes from the ingredients that they use in their specialty rolls.  They even have soy paper wrapped rolls for those who do not indulge in seaweed.  They were not bad.  Also, another thing is they have a decent amount of non fried rolls.  Many places go overboard on the fried rolls which is a bit much at times.I have only been during dinner time.  Edamame is good.Some of the best sushi that I have had in a while....great rolls with good sauces to complement them. The Chicken Katsu was pretty good for katsu as well (meaning katsu tastes pretty similar in general). The chicken was good quality and the katsu sauce was flavorful. We had the Tempura ice cream for dessert and it was phenomenal.My wife and I are from CA and have been looking for good sushi in the Charlotte area and have finally found a place we both really like! We can't wait to go back and try some more rolls!Note: its not so much Asian Fusion as it is authentic Japanese foodI. Love. This. Place.If you asked me one food I could eat every day for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, it would be sushi. And if you asked for specifics? It would be sushi from Yama. Love the miso soup. Love the seaweed salad (and my husband loves the squid salad). We both love the sushi and sashimi -- it's fresh, delicious, there's a wide selection, and if you order enough of it, they'll even bring it to you on a wooden boat.Haven't tried any of the "fusion" that goes on here, though -- I'm perfectly content with the best sushi in Charlotte.Yama-lujah!  I just found my new favorite sushi spot in Charlotte! A fellow foodie recommended this place as the best sushi in Charlotte......really? After hearing that, I made it a priority to check it out after my next monthly visit to Earth fare. It took me forever to decide on a roll, even though I had studied the menu prior to going, but the server was so very helpful with her recommendations and they were eager to cater to whatever you asked for.......gotta love great service! I finally decided on the Southpark and Filet lover's roll and they both were out of this world good! As good as it was, I'm still hesitant to jump on that 'best sushi' in Charlotte train as Enso's sushi is equally as good as Yama in my opinion, but I will definitely be back........perhaps I'll need to save up before my next visit as the rolls are quite pricey at Yama, but worth every penny:-)I came with my boyfriend and his family for dinner and all six of us were sorely, sorely disappointed. Not only was the food overpriced and gross, but the manager was all kinds of shady.What we ordered:Tempura appetizer ($8.95)Morrison Roll ($13.95)Sunrise Roll ($9.95)Honeymoon Roll ($5.95)Hibachi Chicken entree ($13.95)Hibachi Steak & Scallop entree [+ upgrade to filet mignon] ($22.95)The rolls were DINKY and mediocre at best. My boyfriend says he can find better rolls at Harris Teeter. The chicken in the hibachi chicken entree was overcooked, dry, and salty. The steak in the hibachi steak entree was super dry and supposed to be medium rare, which it wasn't.Honestly, tacking on "Asian Fusion" to your restaurant name does not give you an excuse to serve poorly-made, half-assed, inauthentic "Japanese" food.The fun doesn't stop there. When I got the check, I was surprised to see "19.67% Gratuity" added on to the subtotal. I knew from what was printed in the menu that an 18% gratuity is automatically added for parties of six or more. I called our waiter over to give us an explanation; his response was shady and unclear. I obviously wasn't satisfied so he had the manager come over to explain it, which he did in an even more shady manner. He said something to the effect of "Just subtract the tax from the subtotal and the gratuity comes out correctly." When I didn't buy that explanation either, he said "The computer says 19.67% but if you add it up it's 18%."Anyone with a pea-sized brain would see through the manager's pathetic and feeble attempt to justify the arbitrary 19.67% gratuity. I literally had to punch out the numbers on a calculator in front of him just to show him what 18% really amounted to. He took the check back to "check it out." When he returned, he said he took out gratuity so that we could give however much we saw fit. He didn't even give a simple apology; a "sorry about that" would have sufficed. Needless to say, I left muuuch less than 18%. If you end up siding with the majority opinion here (which I find shocking), at the very least do a double-take when you get your check. I didn't think there could be such shady behavior at a somewhat upscale restaurant, especially in the South Park area, but I was clearly proven wrong.P.S. Fun fact: "yama" in Thai means "don't come." Take that as a warning :PI'm really glad to see new sushi places like this one popping up on the map in Charlotte.   It used to be the same old places, but now with the competition moving in people will have to up their games to compete.Know your roll.... I only tried 2 rolls during my first visit here last night, but they were delicious and very filling.  The menu had a lot of other rolls to try that sounded super yummy so I have a feeling this place will not get old fast with the variety of rolls offered.  The menu also had a lot of sake - which I could totally go for on a weekend.. not when I have a deadline to beat on a Friday (the following day).Our server was very nice and was patient with us since we were a large group and did not all arrive at the same time.  Making reservations for the group, and it was just a quick, painless (less than a minute) phone call.  I did feel a little funny since the phone is quickly answered with a quick "yama" and I found myself stumbling over my words, but I managed to get my gears turning and the words finally came out coherently.   Overall... this is my "sushi-go-to" place for the time being.Yama probably has the best sushi in Charlotte. Their waiter and waitress are soo nice, and they don't forget about you, even when their super busy. I love their Tempura Ice Cream, which is to die for! And their price range is pretty average, but for good sushi like their, I would say their price is very affordable! This place is SUPERB!fresh fish, a very good selection of sake, and a very knowledable owner. this place is great for business meals, family gatherings, and when you want some good Japanese food!

Review Text :
My top 3 budget meals in my Henderson 'hood (no particular order):- Manna - eg Gyro + fries or salad + drink + tax for less than $10- Gata Thai - $6.95 lunch combo served daily 11 am - 3 pm- Village Pub - steak + happy hour booze is a bargainService is always friendly here and I've enjoyed the 2 dishes I've tried so far.  Looking forward to trying more.I've made it my personal mission in life to seek out and try any and all Mediterranean restaurants in any town I live in. I finally made it out to Henderson to try this spot, and I have to say, despite the friendly service, the food sadly wasn't worth the trek.Standard gyro is meaty, and the tzatziki sauce is a bit different than usual- did not seem to contain any cucumbers? There is a lunch option to add on fries and a drink for an affordable price. The side of dolmades (grape leaves) tasted a little off, as if perhaps they were out of a jar. Filling texture was gummy and off-putting, and there was a strong, bitter after-taste that lingered uncomfortably that I haven't encountered with other versions.Service was polite and the location is clean, but pricing is all over the place: $6 for a gyro is great, $2 to add on feta is a little absurd. I wanted to grab some falafel as a side, but the appetizer order is over $5. I think the odd pricing is why most reviewers (myself now included) only recommend the lunch special.

Review Text :
I'm well aware that Jack In The Box is by no means a purveyor of healthy and innovative culinary creations.  But unhealthy as the food may be if eaten on a daily (or even weekly) basis, I don't see much harm in occasionally succumbing to my latent junk food addiction.  Whenever I'm in the mood to throw caution to my waistline while holding tight to my wallet, JITB is invariably the first place that comes to mind--at least so long as it's been a respectable 3+ weeks since my last visit.Setting aside the broader debate on the extent to which fast food may or may not be to blame for all that is wrong with America today, those of us who do at least occasionally frequent what I like to euphemistically term "accelerated dining establishments" are sometimes faced with important choices about where to fill up on empty calories.  For a number of reasons, I think JITB stands above the rest.  First, JITB serves both breakfast and lunch/dinner at all times, so if you arrive at 11:30 am in search of a breakfast sandwich, you won't be stuck getting a burger instead.  Second, JITB always seems to have new and interesting menu items.  Third, and most importantly, the Ultimate Cheeseburger is always delicious.As for this particular location, I've been twice.  Both times, I found the employees to be the friendliest and most courteous I've ever encountered at a fast food restaurant (though the people working at the KFC/A&W location on the corner of Baseline and Central are similarly deserving of praise), and everything I've tried has lived up to my memories of what JITB should taste like.  If at all possible, though, I suggest eating on-site or in the car instead of waiting until you get home, as the food is never quite the same again after those first few minutes pass.

A less than enjoyable Sunday brunch was had here recently, and it was enough to make me reevaluate my enjoyment of V.H.As a deli, it's great. As I've said before, there's a plethora of meat, cheese, vinegars, oils. They have a good, varied and unusual range of savoury foods for lunch and dinner every day; so if you were needing a tasty dinner option, didn't want to cook, but still wanted home-made meals, pop in here for a reheatable delight. Seriously tempting stuff. Their cakes are also scrummy.But this is all for takeaway. To sit in I really haven't ever had a 'lovely' expereince. Y'know when you want Sunday brunch, you want to cosy up somewhere for an hour or two, deliicious food, the paper, warm and cheery enviornment? Everytime I've sat in, the staff have seem a little flustered. The girls are all lovely, but there generally seems to be an air of subdued panic. Most recently, the boy and I came here. His order was taken and I wasn't asked what I wanted. As a result, I ordered seperately, and my food came out 10 minutes after his. So he'd finished his soup (which was delicious) and sandwich before mine arrived. When it did, the order was wrong. I'd asked for eggs benedict without hollandaise (I can't stand the stuff). It came with hollandaise. I saw the girl write down 'without' on the tab, so it must have been a misread in the kitchen. It was duly replaced with a fresh one. Fine. But this, on top of my order being taken seperately and arriving later than my dining partner's left me eating it whilst he watched me, without the same shared glow of "mmm isn't this Sunday brunch lovely". It felt more that "right now my food's here, I need to eat it". Yknow?Ok so that was a mini rant. I do still like Victor Hugo's for all the delicious food it provides. But the sitting in experience has always left me slightly jaded, and this particular instance put me off dining in again. A pity really.

Review Text :
This is one of the most overlooked Jamaican restaurants in the city (due in no small part to its location), but it might just be the best and most authentic. Raised by a Jamaican mother and having taken yearly trips to visit family there, I'm always looking to replicate the real experience over here and this is one of the few places that fits the bill. The staff is amazing, super sweet and incredibly helpful and the decor, though sparse, is welcoming. There are only a couple seat, so it's definitely more of a take-out place, but it is well worth the trip.The patties are fresh and flaky, served piping hot, and you can also get them frozen or in cocktail size if you're having a party (and inviting me). The roties boast some really delicious curried filling and you can get chicken, beef or goat. Throw in some gizarda and coconut drops for dessert and you'll be more than satisfied.However, the best of the best is only available on Saturdays: the jerk chicken and jerk pork. Holy moly is this amazing jerk! Spicy, sure, but also incredibly flavourful and prepared in a drier marinade than most places use here, creating a jerk coating that really sticks to the tender, tasty meat. You can buy it by the pound, so I would suggest one of each to last the weekend if you're dining with friends. Really, really spectacular.One last mention is that they also stock all the Grace sodas, Ting and even peanut punch. It's the complete Jamaican experience, minus the weather.Words are a powerful thing, intuition even stronger...I had just written my review for Anancy and found myself in the mood for a chicken roti, hmmm, not in the mood to drive, I thought but after reading Kim B's review for Mr Pattie,, I jumped into my car and drive over there!My love affair with chicken roti started when I was 19, my ex is a Trini and he introduced me to this delicious delicacy that I still enjoy and crave to this day!I followed the directions on Mr Pattie's website from Sherbrooke St West, very easy, thank you:) About 15 minutes later, I drive onto Patricia, a little residential street.I walked in and was greeted with a friendly smile and a warm hello.I ordered 2 beef patties, their golden, orangey hue was calling me from their display case and I knew they would be delicious! I also ordered a chicken roti and a Grace pineapple soda.My order was ready very quickly and I hopped into my car to go home.I put my keys into the ignition to go but settled back into my seat to taste a pattie. They were very hot which I like, the pastry was very flaky and the filling oh so deliciously spiced and unlike most places, this pattie was stuffed with filling, no skimpy, thin layer! Mmmm, it was worth the drive! I contemplated eating the other but I was a thoughtful gf and brought it home:)I brushed the crumbs off me and started driving home, my roti tempting me with it's curried aroma teasing my senses.Onto the roti...I got home, opened the bag and took my first bite, oh my god was my first thought! Heavenly! Beautifully spiced, saucy, flavorful, nice chunks of potato and the chicken, beyond tender and delicious! I thoroughly enjoyed every mouthful and I will not be hesitating to drive back when my next roti craving hits me!I can't wait to try their jerk pork and jerk chicken, I definitely plan on getting some to BBQ!Thanks Kim for your descriptive, well written review and thanks Mr Pattie for making your food so delicious!You're sure not going to find a better patty anywhere near Montreal. Got that nice yellow-orange flaky action, well-seasoned (if maybe underspiced; I'm always looking for a little more heat than I can get up here). Really lovely people running the shop. This place is more like a 4 to me, but I'm spoiled from having grown up in the north Bronx, so 5 it is.

Review Text :
It's no revelation that Pho Chandler has fantastic tasty Pho, and that its always packed when you go pick up your dinner Pho to-go.What really bowled over my berries was their Pad Thai.  We've all had it somewhere.  I prefer Thai Dressing's version, or even Pei Wei's version to say Thai Rama's.  So I knows whats I likes...The first thing that stood out to me, was the vermicelli noodles.  Much thinner than any other Thai place I've ordered from... and yes, I know this is a Vietnamese restaurant.  Maybe that's the difference... Viet Pad Thai uses angel hair.  I don't know, but I'm going with it.While I momentarily considered it odd, I immediately found it an absolute delight.  And the prep work!  Yes, the prep work.  Everything was skillfully diced.  No chokey chicken pieces here, you know, the kind that are infamous for lodging in windpipes.The taste was there.  The constancy was there.  I was there.  And if I have my way, I'll be there again tomorrow, ordering you know what.  Hey, why don't you meet me at Pho Chandler, and we'll satisfy that Pad Thai lover in you.

Review Text :
I stopped by this past weekend for lunch by myself.  Having never tried Polish food except for the ubiquitous pierogies, I was keen to sample this unfamiliar cuisine.  Because I can be quite picky about the type and form of meat that I eat, I decided to play it safe and order the meatless platter ($11). It came with the following items: a generous helping of haluski, two potato pancakes, and three pierogies (farmer's cheese, potato/cheddar, mushrom/sauerkraut), as well as sides of applesauce and sour cream for the potato pancakes and pierogies, respectively (see photo).All of the dishes comprising the platter were cooked perfectly, and were absolutely delicious.  The haluski was al dente, and had a nice butter-herb sauce; the potato pancakes were crispy on the outside with a soft, pliable interior; and the pierogies were flavorful and stuffed with filling.  All of them were good, but my favorite was the potato/cheddar, which had a deliciously warm and savory filling that was well complemented by the cool, creamy sour cream.  These were definitely not your grocery store variety Mrs. T's pierogies, which are served at many restaurants around town--these are the real deal!As I was waiting for my lunch to be served, I browsed the store and was intrigued by the wide variety of Polish foodstuffs.  My attention was captured in particular by the pierogies in the freezer (the same ones served on my platter, I presume), as well as the interesting soups in the refrigerator in the back (tripe soup, anyone?).  If you're looking for hard-to-find Polish goods, this is probably one of your best bets around town to find them.  If, on the other hand, Polish cuisine is as foreign to you as it is to me, stop by for a delicious, filling lunch that will provide a great introduction to it!Working just up the street from S&D Polish Deli, I cannot believe it took me so long to get here.  The Deli is a combination of a store and a lunch window, which is perfect.  While you are ordering lunch and waiting, you can pick up any meats or Polish delicacies you could want for dinner!  They also have frozen pierogies that you can take home and heat up for dinner!I came in a week or so ago, and I ordered the spinach and cheese pierogies, which was the daily special.  For only $4, I got 4 pockets of joy.  The butter sauce was delicious.  The inside was 98% spinach and 2% cheese so I would only order these as a spinach lover.  The filling was fantastic, and there was a plethora of it.  I really want to try the farmer's cheese and potato cheddar ones now too.The employees are very friendly, and I look forward to returning soon!

HORRIBLE!I will be brief because I would spend way too much time writing on how bad this place is.1. When we asked not to be sat at the bathrooms, the hostess rolled her eyes and pointed to a table behind the 1 she wanted to sit us. After saying once again, "I don't want to sit at the bathrooms please," she huffs and throws our menu's at the 3rd booth and walks away. Normally I would have left but it was the only place open on Christmas Eve night so we had to stay.2. Our waitress, Kris, took her sweet time in getting to our table just so we can order our drinks. I was able to sit down at the table, take my jacket off, get the baby situated, realize the baby needed a diaper change, go and change her diaper, come back and it took her 10 minutes to show up to take our DRINK orders. My husband got a fork where the prong was bent straight up and he had to ask her 5 times for a new fork. She was very slow, fake attitude, and didn't listen to anything we had to say.3. The food....I would have eaten Moist n Meaty dog food and it would have tasted better. Since I wasn't all that hungry, I ordered a Caesar salad and baked potato soup. The dressing on my salad tasted like somebody poured it on the floor, danced a jig on top of it, and scooped it back up to put on my salad. It even looked bad! Caesar salad dressing should look creamy, kind of a pale tan color....this had a dark tint to it and smelled horrible. My husband also got a Caesar salad and he had the same problem. He ordered a cheeseburger that was a hockey puck. The only thing that was good was the skillet dip, the chips weren't even good! They were from the bottom of the pile, broken in a million tiny pieces, most of them were burnt, and salty as hell. We didn't even finish our meals it was so disgusting. Since we didn't have a good experience with the hostess (which we found out it was the manager), we didn't even bother complaining about the food or the service. It was not worth the $30.52 at all. Nobody got a tip and we will NEVER go back there again. STAY AWAY!!

Review Text :
Holy goodness, this was awesome. Tonight I had a dining experience so amazing that I can't even attempt to be hateful, catty and mean about it. BLT Steak is the best restaurant in the Valley, for realz.The Camelback Inn is a beautiful property and BLT Steak fits right in. The dining room and patio directly faces south on Lincoln, giving you a breathtaking view of Camelback Mountain. This served as a great reminder that I will have to hike my fat ass up Echo Canyon about 50 times to work off all the beef I'm about to devour. Inspirational!The bar has attentive service, stiff drinks and serves complimentary olives, nuts and pop corn with some wizardy spices sprinkled on top. Score - because I like to pre-eat before I sit down and eat. (not being sarcastic)  The servers are great - I think we had a separate food server and beverage attendant, which was fancy and efficient - too things that rarely go hand in hand.But the real highlight was the food. I don't even know where to begin. I'll list everything I ate, and describe it, if I can:Bread with pate: The only thing I didn't like, but I'm not a fan of liver. Not their fault.Moving on...Fresh Popovers with euro butter: The second best bread experience of my life, second only to the GIANT BREAD CART at Le Louis XV, Alain Ducasse's restaurant in Monaco. (An EPIC journey in dining and a must visit for anyone who lives to eat)Hamachi: The freshest buttery yellow tail that ever lived - or lived than died. Whatever - it was dope.Shrimp Cocktail: Holla! Chopped Salad: This was pretty good - but more like a greek salad hybrid. I'd skip it in favor of the...Buffalo Mozzarella Salad: Jackpot! Cheese so soft it melted. Fresh yellow tomatoes, great dressing etc.Filet: The best filet I've had in Arizona, dethroning Maestros and Donovan's, for sure.Ahi Tuna: Rare, plump, buttery, holy shit.Glazed Carrots: I'm obsessed with carrots, particularly cooked ones, and I don't know why. These carrots were off the hook and I almost ate the whole a la carte bowl.Hash Browns: The fact that the hashies came in huge hunks of hash brown pie was pretty awesome and ridiculousPecan Pie: Dope, and ice-creamyFruit Crepe:I  wasn't a fan - too passion fruity for me. But my dining partners dug it.Random Complimentary Dessert Cookies: A nice surpriseSauces: Holy f-ing crap - they offer all these random sauces like peppercorn sauce, horseradish and a mustard trio. Order them ALL even though they are $3 each. Totally worth it!I really liked this entire experience. I left fat and stuffed and happy - and didn't even feel sick or like I had to RUN - not walk - to the bathroom immediately after. Similar dining experiences at steakhouses make me dash for the loo. I know - gross. But you know it happens to you too.BLT Steak 4E, bitches. Seriously.Warning:  what you are about to read may make you want to break open your piggy bank or take a large withdrawal out of your savings account... and likely, you will need to do so to afford to enjoy a meal at BLT Steak.  Read on at your own risk!My fiance and I went on a double date to BLT on Friday night, 2/13 with my parents.  We were celebrating Valentines day a night early, and celebrating the fact that our wedding plans are coming together little by little... this is the perfect place for a celebration!The service was over the top attentive beginning with the valet and hostesses to our server, Matt, and everyone in between.  When I asked where the ladies room was, he escorted me there.  Nice touch.  He also acknowledged our engagement as I told them we were celebrating when I made the reservation.  When we were deciding upon which wine to order, Matt offered to send over the sommelier.  While we didn't take him up on his offer, I was still quite impressed!Since we arrived right on time for our 6:45 reservation, we didn't get to try the "complimentary olives, nuts and pop corn with wizardy spices sprinkled on top" that Jenn H mentioned in her review.  Bummer, cause I love that stuff, but probably good because I had room more for everything else we ordered.I skipped the first bread course but I ate an entire popover - the second bread course.  Divine.  Really.  I didn't realize what a huge popover fan I was until I polished that off!Oh - and I can't go on without mentioning the fact that we had a really tasty smooth and savory bottle of Cabernet that went well with everything we ordered.  OK - on to the apps...I had the raw oysters, my dad had the fried oyster special, and Jared had a spinach salad.  Of course, we shared with my mom as well.  Actually, come to think of it, I think they shared theirs but I'm not so sure I shared mine!We did share our sides, and each one was better than the next... creamed spinach, glazed carrots, and stuffed mushrooms.  To go with those, my parents shared a T-bone steak (cowboy dusted I think), and Jared and I shared a Kobe Ribeye.  It was ahhhhhmazing!We were way full after all of that food, but we were celebrating after all, so we decided to share a dessert which my family allowed me to choose.  I went with the blueberry-lemon merengue.  My dad didn't like my choice, so he requested a chocolate peanut butter mousse as well.  On top of that, they brought us some complimentary espresso chocolate petits fours.Can you say food coma?!BLT was an experience... and I enjoyed every second of it.  I highly recommend BLT for a celebratory meal or dinner/drinks if someone else is footing the bill!Lastly, in case you didn't know ('cause I didn't before I took a BLT business card), BLT stands for Bistro Laurent Tourondel, named after Superstar Chef Laurent Tourondel... and there are several other BLT concepts across the US.We dined here for my birthday on 2/13. We had a reservation and we were seated promptly. We got a very nice table with corner bench seating, so we could sit side by side. Our server was efficient and very friendly. We were served the complimentary chicken pate. Sorry to say, I am not a fan of pate, but it was a very nice touch. Next came the legendary popovers. I understand that these are Chef Tourondel's signature. They were so amazing. We decided to share the crab cake appetizer. It was served with remoulade and spicy coleslaw. I can't say enough about how delicious it was! The slaw and the crab was a perfect combination. It was definitely the best crab cake that I ever have eaten. The best! Since it was my birthday, I went a little crazy with birthday drinking. I had "The Fountain of Youth" which was delicious. Can't remember any of the ingredients, but it's an amazing drink. For dinner, I had the filet mignon. Oh, my. It was perfectly cooked, and so tender and delicious with the right amount of char. I opted for the chimichurri sauce which was SO good. BJ opted for the 3 lb. lobster. Wholly, mother of lobster, it was huge and perfectly prepared. And even more amazing, he was able to eat it all. Well, I helped a bit. For sides, we selected grilled asparagus and a baked potato. The potato was served with add your own sour cream, chives, cheese and bacon. The sides were huge and meant for sharing. Even though we were full, we couldn't not pass on dessert. We had the warm chocolate tart served with pistachio ice cream. Wow, it was so good. Also, they were thoughtful enough to serve this complimentary with a nice bday inscription on the plate complete with candle. How nice. Another thoughtful touch was a letter with the Chef thanking us for dining there and a promise of 10% off on our next visit. Wow, that's sweet!  Also, the complimentary dessert cookies were also very nice!As the other yelp reviewers have mentioned, this restaurant is expensive and best reserved for special occasions. However, my birthday experience here is one that will never be forgotten. It was amazing!!  Thanks BLT!My husband and I ventured up to BLT Steak at Camelback Inn on Friday evening to celebrate our third wedding anniversary, which was two days earlier. We sat inside and our corner table gave us a perfect view of Camelback Mountain at night. Our waiter was super nice and did a great job of suggesting items and answering questions when we had them. There was a seperate server who kept our water glasses full all night - we couldn't take more than two sips without having them refilled it seemed like. My only negative about our waiter was that when it was time for a new glass of wine for me, he didn't check with me first to see if I wanted another glass of the same wine. I think we all know the common saying about assuming things...On to the food...here's what we sampled:Popovers - delicious. I was a bit skeptical about the butter and sea salt, especially since I don't like butter very much, but it was great! Caesar salad - good size and it was one of the best caesar salads I have had in awhile. Crabcake - my least favorite part of the meal. While it wasn't horrible, there was a bit too much celery for my taste and not enough crab meat.Cowboy Ribeye - since it was 22 oz, I graciously told my husband that I would have some of it so he could order it. Now those that know me know that I don't eat red meat because I don't like the taste. But I sucked it up and had some...holy crap, I had a few bites and said, "Wow, this is really good". So that should say something about how good it was. However, my husband did think the outside was a tad too well done, although the meat itself was cooked perfectly. While he liked the ribeye, he did think his steak at SW Steakhouse in Las Vegas was better.Mashed potatoes - is it possible to get divorced over mashed potatoes? I thought we were going to throw it down because one side of the potatoes was just not enough!! They were sooo creamy and delicious. Chocolate peanut butter mousse - we got our dessert for free since when I made the reservation I indicated we were celebrating our anniversary. The dessert was a nice way to end the meal, although the chocolate on top was just a touch too rich for my taste.With tip, our bill came to $162 which we did not think was bad at all for as much as we ordered. Unfortunately we didn't get to sit on the patio or enjoy the view at sunset, but I guess that means we'll have to go back which isn't a bad thing at all!BLT Steak truly is a special occasion restaurant, as my boyfriend and I learned firsthand on Valentine's Day. We arrived at the JW Marriott Resort's restaurant a little early and were greeted by the hostess, who then apologized that they were running a little behind on reservations. Not a problem, since we'd hoped to have a drink in the bar before dinner. The bartender made a good Manhattan for my sweetie and I enjoyed my V-Day special drink, which was a prickly pear-flavored Cosmo. Just a little while later, we were approached by a woman who announced that our table was ready, placed our drinks on a silver tray, and escorted us to our seats. (I love when restaurants go the extra step and take care of your drinks for you. Failing that, I love when my date carries my drink for me.)At our table, we were faced with a terrible decision: order off the $60 special prix-fixe menu or select from one of the many prime cuts of steak on offer. The horror! Fortunately for us, the items on the prix-fixe menu were also available a la carte. We decided to splurge and get the most romantic dish on the menu: the 40 oz. Porterhouse for two, plus a roasted beet salad starter from the prix-fixe menu and sides of creamed spinach and potatoes au gratin. Last of all we selected Roquefort and Bearnaise from the list of sauces. Honestly, there were so many choices in each category and everything sounded so great that it took us about half an hour before we could place our order. Our server was patient with us throughout and never made us feel rushed.Sometime in between ordering our entrees and receiving the complimentary gigantic popovers for which BLT is famous (and rightly so), we were approached by the sommelier who offered recommendations, such as a bottle of DeLille Cellars D2 2007.Our Porterhouse was a massive two inches thick, cooked to the requested medium-rare, topped with a thyme compound butter, and served sliced on the bone with a roasted head of garlic alongside. My first bite of steak practically melted in my mouth, and though they didn't need it, the remainder of my bites were topped with either sauce. Some of the steak seemed to be a bit more done, but that's to be expected when trying to cook such a thick, bone-in cut. I found that I preferred the Roquefort with the more well-done pieces, and the Bearnaise with the rare.The sides arrived in adorable individual Staub casseroles and were also mouth-watering. The gratin was a perfectly arranged layer of potato coins bathed in a rich, creamy, cheesy sauce with a hint of roasted garlic. And the creamed spinach was the best I've had: not too saucy and with the perfect amount of nutmeg.Throughout the meal, the wine paired well and really opened up as the evening progressed. At the conclusion of the meal, however, I realized that the full-bodied wine's flavor had changed to something more, well, saline. In fact, the only note I could taste was salt--and my boyfriend agreed. When Scott came by to check on us, we invited him to taste some of the wine. He declined politely, but when we explained that the flavor of the wine was now off, he poured a small taste off the floor. When he returned he conceded that he could see how we felt it was now salty, and said that perhaps it would have benefited from being decanted. Did we want it taken off our bill? Just then, although we'd declined dessert, our server placed a complimentary plate of brownie-like bites on the table. As Scott was talking, I took a bite and then a sip of the wine. Again, the wine's flavor changed and really enhanced the toffee flavor of the little cake. My boyfriend told Scott that the wine had been fine up until the end--and was again perfect. Still, Scott insisted that we have two glasses of dessert wine, especially since we'd received yet another complimentary dessert plate, this time of chocolate mousse-filled cornets.As we sipped the late harvest Zinfandel and the Hungarian Tokaji, we chatted with Scott and learned that he is originally from Napa. We mentioned that we are from the Bay Area and enjoy going up to wine country. But next time we'll be well armed with his suggestions of wineries to try.My sweetie and I ended up closing down the restaurant, with full bellies and fond memories. Even though there had been some minor imperfections with our meal, the personal attention we received from Scott Larson and the gracious service ensured this five-star review.Oh BLT how I love thee. You are one of those restaurants that my mind wonders to on a hungry day. You are a restaurant that I think about when I want a restaurant with an atmosphere and view of Camelback Mountain. And with your bar and indoor/outdoor seating arrangements, you are the perfect place to enjoy a meal on a warm or cool day.I've dined at BLT twice and I think I will be setting up a sleeping bag and just living there from now on. Most recently, I went last night for my birthday. When asked to pick my restaurant poison for the unbirthday celebration, I didn't have to think twice before saying BLT. I wasn't disappointed. The restaurant was full with people but not overly crowded. Our table was ready upon arrival and situated just by the patio and overlooking the mountains so a perfect mixture of indoor outdoor seating. The service was a bit on the slow side but I enjoyed that since this was a leisurely dinner and not one you want to get rushed. The waiter definitely gave us our time. After beginning with wine (a must at a Steakhouse of course), we were served my very favorite classic starter -- popovers! They were large in charge and full of buttery taste. I could probably go back for the popovers alone. For the meal, my table chose between the classic steak and the sole. I went with the sole and to insert much needed awful puns here...I felt the soul train after just one bite! How do I describe it. Upon taking a bite, I tasted candied pecan. As random as it sounds, it tasted delicious. It was a good amount of sole and due to the heaviness of the sauce (delicious sauce by the way), I couldn't finish it as much as I tried. I know I'll be dreaming about the sole for years to come. Plus, since this is not a restaurant you visit for a random Tuesday night and the dollar signs exceed $$$, I will be dreaming for awhile but it's a good memory to have! Moving on to dessert, we tasted a bit of everything and the cheesecake was tasty. I ordered an apple crisp tart and it was ok, but the entree was definitely the highlight of the evening. The only awkward moment of the night was that since it was my birthday, my table apparently tried to tell the staff three times and put the note on the reservation. But, alas three reminders later, still no birthday candle on a dessert (which was fine by me since I like to avoid the birthday if at all possible but my table wouldn't let it slide.) Finally after one final awkward reminder, just as we were ready to go and plates had practically been cleared, a random chocolate souffle appeared with happy birthday. Still no candle and the moment was kind of over but the thought still counts. So I'd probably say this was a great birthday spot for me since I don't enjoy the birthday candle as much, but if you visit and that's important to you, you may want to get on that as early in the dinner as possible! Now that I am officially full for the weekend, I will never forget my great birthday experience at BLT and I definitely think this is a restaurant you should consider for a special occasion. One last thing -- the mixologist for cocktails is amazing and she knows her bourbon, so if she's working the night you visit, definitely ask her for a special drink!This review is just for Happy Hour:I finally got to try out BLT Steak granted it was just the happy hour menu but I was still blown away.  For starters the prices are no where near the full dinner items so it really makes it affordable to just pop in and see what this amazing place has to offer.  The drink list is huge and again very affordable.  I recommend the mojito very good and just the right mix of tart and freshness.  For light bites I had the Duck Pate with wine mustard which was very good.  It had some nice earthy flavor that the wine mustard really played well with.  I then got the steak tartar which was just phenomenal.  It had a little kick to it and the steak just melted in your mouth and absorbed all the richness of the quail egg.  I can't wait to go back for dinner service.

Restaurant name  The Mission

Review Text :
I met the BF for a nightcap at The Mission on Thursday night, and it was such a cool place and had such an appealing menu that I decided to return tonight (Friday) to celebrate my birthday with a small group of friends.  Even though it was kind of last minute, the staff at The Mission was extremely accommodating, and we had an incredible experience.(For those of you that follow my reviews, please note that our birthday dinner at The Mission was quite the opposite of our experience at Estate House in February, in a wonderful way!)I am pleased to say that I did not taste anything I didn't like tonight at The Mission, and I did a fair share of tasting!  Starting with their red sangria, their special frozen mango margarita, fresh made guacamole, incredible salsa (I swear my friends wanted to bottle it up and take it home), scallop entree, sweet potato & potato fries, and milkshake dessert, I feel like I gained a good five lbs at dinner, but I would do it all over again for sure - we had so much fun!  The food really is exceptional and there are still a handful of menu items that I can't wait to try!Sonia was our waitress and took great care of us along with Brian (who runs the joint), and a team of other staff.  Our glasses stayed full throughout the evening and they continued to check on us to make sure we didn't need anything else.  It was crowded with a fun vibe and I am sure we'll be back again real soon as The Mission is a new favorite in the hood for us!So, Gabi did it again!  She somehow found the perfect spot to mingle with fellow yelpers, and MINGLE we did!  I don't know if it was the Coronas or the guacamole, but for some odd reason all of my inhibitions flew out the nicely decorated adobe windows.  I found myself chatting with some very interesting people and thoroughly enjoyed myself.When I first arrived (@5:25pm) there weren't too many people here.  Scott reminded me that it was still a bit early, so I took advantage and GOT MY DRINK ON.  Eventually, a group of blue hairs came in and got the party started (not really, they just sat down and ordered food, but that would make an awesome story, right?!) I saw some familiar faces from past events Julia, Dottsy, & Robert. Sorry, I don't nag my weak memory with last initials, but I also met some GREAT new faces.Thanks, Gabi! I dunno how you do it, but somehow you always do!I should probably give in and up this review to 5 stars but I want to go back and right an update where I use LOADS of exclamation points, so I'll stick with 4 stars for today. That said: !!!!!!!!! and to follow up: yummmm. I stopped by for lunch and sat on the front patio which was perfect since the the sun was diffused, there was a breeze and I could eyeball other people's meals while I waited. My server was Sam who is probably the most gregarious server I've had in a long time. That was great because I was dining alone and he made me feel like I was not a loser. I ordered the Corn Gorditas ($9) and the Taro Fries ($7) and was pleased with both. My only regret was using the fries' two dipping sauces because it numbed my pallate a little in terms of appreciating the nuances of the gorditas, which were a little small for a $9 appetizer but all the same, very complete in their blend of flavors and textures. Then I took my meal to the next level by ordering dessert. I'm not sure "orgasm in my mouth" is a family-friendly term but nonetheless it applies to the pumpkin bread pudding ($6) I ordered. As if pumpkin needed any help, The Mission soaks it in a caramel sauce and sprinkles it with pepitas and pomegranate seeds after adding a heaping scoop of vanilla bean ice cream. orgasm.in.my.mouth. I only wished there were a few more pomegranate seeds tossed on there because their tart juice really contrasted beautifully. I tried not to moan out loud as I ate it. So the Mission isn't cheap, not by a long stretch, but what is created in that kitchen is culinary artwork, and combined with their very friendly staff and cozy atmosphere, I think the Mission is doing everything right.I think for my sesquicentennial review, I've gotten to a point where I'm letting the food direct the show of stars. Sure, we have the servers and cooks as producers, the location as our stage, lighting, sound and supporting staff. But the meal, ah, that is our celebrated lead actor. Without it, all other pieces may paint a pretty picture, but what good is a painting when it medium is missing? The Mission really delivers its lines well. Almost too well. Like Dakota Fanning well. Each plate has a spectrum of flavors--bold and smoky with subtle and delicate undertones of fresh herbs. Each dish is skillfully plated and ready for its closeup. My steak tacos were so intensely flavored, I didn't really dwell on the fact there were but three petite tortilla shells mounded with strips of magnificently grilled flank steak and slices of fresh avocado. And the papas y chorizo, which I ordered as an accompaniment, helped balance the palate yet was still a strong item on its own. Robert M's pozole was as unique as it was flavorful, delicious, satisfying and, ironically, humble. The bread pudding he ordered at the end of meal was, according to him, a premature ejaculation. Apparently, that means it was good, so I'll take his word for that. Those who joined us for this meal seemed to share some of the enthusiasm over the dessert, but I don't eat sweets so will have to believe their accolades worthy. What, pray tell, denies The Mission of the much clamored five-star rating? Primarily, it's the associated fees. On one hand, I was blown away by the sensuous flavors apparent in every edible item. On the other hand, I was blown away upon seeing the bill (especially since I had nothing but water to drink). Does one negate the other? Perhaps. Am I at a place in my life where such a statement rings true? Not necessarily. While my initial response was, I wouldn't likely return to The Mission if it was my decision, I confess that I would, willingly, give myself back to The Mission if only for the sublime sins of doting on sustenance.Since The Mission is getting ready to celebrate their one year anniversary, I figure it's time for an update.  I went in for my first visit last November, shortly after they opened, and I've been in countless times since.  The atmosphere is amazing, the staff welcoming, the food unique and tasty... oh, and the drinks go down easy too!The Mission has become Jared's second home - he's there much more than I am!  I go for an occasional drink or dinner.  My favorite menu item is the tableside prepared guacamole.  It's fantastic!  I am also a huge fan of the white bean puree, the street corn, and the salmon.  I wish they had some lighter options on the menu though - just a suggestion on behalf of those of us that are health-conscious!If you enjoy Latin-inspired fare, for sure go check out The Mission... Or at the very least, go in for a drink and some guacamole.  Look for Jared at the bar when you're there!I"ll for sure be excited to celebrate The Mission's one year anniversary in late October.  I'm sure it will be one helluva party!  It always is at The Mission!I want to love The Mission. I really do. The decor is awesome and the margaritas ROCK! But, the food is not doing it for me and I'm so disappointed! I have had the guacamole and I thought it was fine but nothing so special it should be three times the price of guacamole anywhere else.The cheese plate, on the other hand, I'd say that's where it's at  - the cheese portions were fair and the grilled pan de yuca was warm, soft and delicious!The pozole was good but while I thought it was cute that the "heat" came on the side (you add your own serrano and garnish) I would have liked more of the flavor to come from the kitchen. I actually have to say I did NOT like the mahi mahi tacos and it had nothing to do with the size (they ARE small - the tortillas can't be more than 4 inches in diameter but the filling portions are generous). It was the fat little fish sticks that served as the filling --  all I could taste was the batter! By my second taco, I was trying to pick the batter off and come the third - I just gave up and left it in hopes of enjoying dessert.Dessert was good - I had the churros on the recommendation of the many Yelp reviews I had read and they were OK. I actually preferred the fried bananas - more specifically, the peanut butter mousse that they were plated with! OK, I was going to give this place 2 stars but I'm going to round up to 3 with a caveat: For dinner, "Meh. I've experienced better." but for sharing a cheese plate, maybe some pozole, a couple margaritas or a romantic setting for dessert with a bottle of wine, it's "A-OK."Table side guac is such an awesomely good idea. They'll make it here as spicy as you want, even throwing in habanero peppers if you think you can handle it. Besides the appetizers I tried the mahi tacos and they were great, baja style, but very, very lightly breaded and fried. We also had the please of trying mini-churros with a milkshake (mmmmmmm), fried bananas, and bread pudding. I'm not a fan of bananas or bread pudding so I'm not a good judge of if they were good or not, but the rest of my table assured me they were.I also really dig the interior of The Mission. It sort of reminds me of the Alamo, although I only ever went to The Alamo once many years ago so my memories could be wrong. However, it has that open, cool, stone feel with tons of great chandeliers and candles hanging around and setting the mood. So, um, check it out and get into the mood.Holy Shit. If 'the mission' of The Mission is to serve the best brunch in town...then...Mission easily accomplished. We went here for the weekend brunch the other day and our socks were completely knocked off by how amazing it was. To start...it's just such a quaint and unique restaurant. The salt bricks...the old chandeliers...the antique furniture...it all makes you feel like you've stept into some fine dining establishment in a South American town.Food was AMAZING. To start the chips were fresh and crispy and the salsa tasted almost like it had just been made minutes ago. We then ordered a Black Bean Arepa with fries and a Cinnamon Almond Waffle. The BBA was delectable...two freshly made thick corn tortillas with egg, cheese, black beans, and peppers...it really hit the spot. The fries were a mix of regular and sweet potato, and honestly are some of the best fries I've had in recent memory. Thin, crunchy and fresh tasting. The waffle was also sent from heaven...drizzled with candied almonds, cinnamon, cream, and topped with cinnamon ice cream. It was basically a wedding of breakfast and dessert in all the right ways. Top top it all off...this all came out to a mere 19 bucks. Unbelievable. Incredible value for your money when you're eating at a nice place like this. You could easily go spend the same amount of money at Denny's for God's sake. It wasn't very busy when we were there and I'm not sure why. I'm guessing this place is more hoppin' around dinner time, and I can't wait to try their dinner menu. You've been warned though...you're missing out big time if you don't try brunch here. If they stop serving it due to a lack of demand, I might just explode like the dude at the end of Big Trouble in Little China. GO HERE. 5/5.I never knew that there could be fancy Mexican food that I loved as much as my local taco truck. I was wrong. Dead wrong. Be sure to order the pork shoulder tacos and a bottle of the Inedit beer straight outta Barcelona!My wife and I were spending time with another couple at old town Scottsdale and we decided to eat at The Mission.  This was our first time here and all four of us were extremely happy that we chose The Mission.  Everything about the experience was awesome.  You must get the table-side guacamole, it was amazing!The entree portions were just the right amount because you'll definitely want to enjoy all the chips and guacamole.  Very yummy!  Plus, the service and drinks were superb.  We were able to get in right away on this visit, but I would recommend making a reservation via Opentable to ensure you get a table.  You won't be disappointed.We are looking forward to going back to dine on the patio again.I am torn between two stars and three stars even though the food was Exquisite.Short Story-Great food but smaller than Barbie Sized but full price.Long Story-I had the halibut that was over maybe two tablespoons of rice and had a delicious tomato sauce poured around it that tasted similar to Campbell's Soup but better because I couldn't taste the tin can and it had a great layered spice to it that was just right. The top of my fish was sprinkled with some crisp taro threads and my petite halibut was cooked to perfection and seasoned perfect. Vegetables were not a part of this meal ($28)My husband had the Chorizo Porchetta it was impressive coming out with a flaming rosemary stuck into it, I noticed that it looked like a petite filet  across the table in the dark but was a pork shoulder and the chorizo (a hard style chorizo) was stuffed into it, the plate had a very tiny dish of white bean puree on the side. I am looking at my measuring cups right now and the dish looked like my quarter cup but the dish of beans wasn't filled all the way so it was less than a quarter cup also vegetables were not a part of this entree ($24) Both of us and the two tables seated on both sides of us thought it was too dark in the dining room you REALLY HURT your eyes trying to read the menu in such darkness no matter how young or great your eyesight is.The tables are too close together so much so that you have to pull your table out of the way for people seated on the bench to get out. Service was casual.Petite proteins, less than quarter cup side with entrees (1/2 cup is correct amount of food) vegetable side not included,full price..I wouldn't mind paying $10 more an entree so we could receive 1/2 cup side portions and a vegetable portion.                               We will not return.Whoa. Oh, and wow. So, I was debating giving this place four stars because yes it is dark in there and yes the tables are a bit cramped and it did get loud.... but..... I just can't. The food was so good that it completely made up for those things. The BF and I went here for my (very very belated) birthday dinner (we had made res's somewhere else on my b day that fell through *cough* monarch *cough* and had to make new plans). So I decided to try something a bit different and go to the Mission. I am very glad I did. The BF and I made open table reservations and were seated promptly when we got there. Our waiter was this funny guy named Derek, who, at first I thought I wasn't going to like that much (I have an aversion to trendy scottsdale people) but turned out to be wonderful and make great suggestions all night! So thanks Derek!The BF and I decided to order a few different small plates to get a feel for the restaurant. We ordered the cola crispy pork belly, the table side guac, the steak tacos, and a side of chipotle honey grits. I also got a Mission margarita. So my margarita comes out and it is really great! I have only had one other margarita that I liked equally. It was extremely fresh and it wasn't made out of that disgusting green sweet stuff that normally makes up margs. I would definitely recommend it (with salt). We then get the chips and salsa. The salsa is really smokey and reminds me of the salsa at Abuelos, if you've ever tried that. I liked it a lot. So the man who makes the Guac came over and asked how spicy we wanted it, and we told him hot. He then proceeded to mix the guac using all fresh ingredients. It was so good! and so fresh! I liked how I could taste each flavor that went in, from the cilantro to the delicious tomato and jalapeno.... it was all good.... also, it had pinons on it, which gave it a cool texture. I have only had one better guac, and that is at Barrio cafe.... We get the rest of the food, and the portions look tiny, but in reality, they are huge because I just ate half an avocado and a bagillion or so chips. The cola pork belly was Ah. Maze. Ing. I have never had anything like it. It's a crispy sweet and spicy pork with peanut sauce in a lettuce cup. It's like thai mexican fusion. It was the best of the meal. The steak tacos were also wonderful. The BF said it was like eating a new york strip in a taco. It was a little sweet and a little savory... all good. The grits were the only part that were just ok. I liked them, they were creamy and different, but I wouldn't get them again. So we had to get dessert, as it was my 'birthday' and Derek recommended the pumpkin bread pudding. Holy crap Derek, you are the man! This thing was one of the most delicious desserts I have had, and definitely the best bread pudding. It's pumpkin bread with a little bit of creme brulee, in a sea of wonderful butterscotch sauce (made from real scotch...mind=blown) with the perfect amount of ice cream and little crunchy seeds for texture. Whoa. Just whoa. All this, and the bill was like 65$... that's wonderful! We could come and not get drinks and not get grits and it would be an affordable dinner, which is the best part, because I want to go back.... like right now.It's been awhile since I last wrote a review for the mission but my love still remains. My two favorite things about the mission are their fresh guacamole and the patio atmosphere. The entire restaurant has this charming old world feel to it and the food and drinks flow with it.I was here shopping in Scottsdale's Old Town just around lunch time. I got hungry so I checked the best place for lunch in the area on Yelp and found The Mission, was highly rated. It was across the street from where I was standing so we headed that way.When we arrived we were able to get a table in the outside courtyard in the front of the restaurant. We informed the waiter we had very little time for lunch. The three of us ordered margaritas with salt at $8 each. They charged an extra $2 for one with Cointreu. We ordered two Almejas Al Vapor stews for $14 each and one shaved Kale salad for only $10. The shaved kale salad consisted of aji amarillo vinaigrette, baby heirlooms, blood orange, goat cheese & marcona almonds. My friend loves kale. The Almejas Al Vapor is a peruvian clam stew, rock shrimp, chorizo, pan de yucca, aji amarillo & roasted corn. I especially enjoyed the unusual appearance and spice of the stew. See my pic. The stew made me want to go to Peru for some more. I have never been to Peru. The waiter was very expeditious in serving us.My total bill for the three of us for lunch was a very reasonable $69 without gratuities and we were all happy with our meals, margaritas and service.If only the service had been more on point, I definitely would have given the Mission 5 stars. The food was fantastic. Every single bite. Drinks were well made too. We had the table side guacamole to start and it was remarkably good. Not sure what they do differently from other places, but it works. I had the Green Chile Duck for my entree and it was one of the best plates of food I've had in a while. It had a sweet, salty, spicy thing going on and was really well balanced. The service, while quite friendly, was inexcusably slow. We waited way too long between courses and what should have taken an hour and a half at most, took close to 3. The restaurant itself is beautiful and the crowd was sharp and good looking. It was extremely busy - especially for a Monday night, so I would definitely recommend getting a reservation.

Review Text :
My second time there was a horrible experience. Gina herself told the waiter to stop telling us what's good for the day's menu and told him "they're young they don't know nothing, don't waste your time on them". We were the first people to arrive and order and the smallest group but our food was last to come out and we began to notice that all the waiters, waitress, and Gina herself was entertaining other customers and left us out. I will never go back there again especially after I have told Gina myself that I did not enjoy the service and she just walked away.A great, family owned Italian bistro with friendly service and incredible home made food at very reasonable prices.The bruschetta is excellent and a refreshing start to the meal.  Loaded with fresh vine ripened tomatoes, EVOO, and a touch of sea salt on perfectly toasted bread.  Perfect start.Any pasta is incredible.  Pastas are always perfectly cooked and finished (the pasta is tossed with the sauce over heat not just poured over).  The veal bolognese is a standout (animal lovers please don't hate me).  A rich tomato sauce, velvety veal, hint of garlic, finished with a drizzle of EVOO and perfectly cooked pasta is so hard to pass up.Prices are very low.  Expect to pay less than $20 per person.Well worth the try.Please read this all the way through.  I'm sorry to be writing this, and I hope that the owner contacts me via yelp.  Summary:  horrible service and bad food prep...probably good recipes though.  My gf and I were so excited to go there tonight for a romantic dinner.  She read about the cioppino reviews on yelp and in the local paper, and we can't disagree with those reviews...BECAUSE WE NEVER GOT SERVED OUR ENTREES!!!We got to the restaurant and were encouraged by all the italian speaking customers; they must know something.  Our waiter told us that they had none of the wines on the wine list, but put it out anyway because their new wine list for their new wines wasn't printed.  A bit quirky, but he recommended a Pinot Grigio and it was decent...so onward.As this was our first time there, we asked the waiter for recommendations and ordered our food.  Me:  fried bread and mozzarella in tomato sauce and filet of sole francese.  Gf:  calamari (recommended by server) and (what else?!) cioppino.  My appetizer was a glorified grilled cheese sandwich; nothing special, but not bad and a huge serving.  My gf's appetizer did not come at all.  We shared and got halfway through my appetizer, when we asked the waiter about her calamari.  He said it would be ready in 3 minutes.  Obviously, they started cooking it right then, and a few minutes later, out came her calamari and my entree!  Her calamari was not good.  The breading was decent, but the squid itself was not.  The dipping sauce, however, was excellent.  This place has some of the better tomato sauce we've had in Las Vegas.  Let's talk entrees:  My fish was raw on the inside.  If you check my profile, I love sushi, but not half-cooked, half-raw lower quality fish.  The francese sauce seemed good, but it was hard to get over the mushy egg-coating and raw inside.  The side of vegetables were excellent, but I'm really starving for something good to say.  (pun?)  We asked about my gf's entree and were told it would be out soon.  About 30 minutes later, we left without getting my fish or her cioppino.  Our waiter obviously let us down.  We spent 1 hr and 20 minutes in there and got a glass of wine each, a grilled cheese sandwich and a bowl of undercooked calamari.  We left $40 on the table and walked out.  Our waiter never admitted a single mistake, nor brought a comp'd glass of wine to hold us during our wait.  In fact, our wine glasses were empty for between 30-45 minutes and still did not get the attention of our waiter.  The owner did not acknowledge a mostly uneaten bowl of calamari and an entree that was sent back.  When we walked out, we passed the owner who couldn't be bothered to even spare us a glance.  This restaurant was not busy.  There was no reason that a table of six, who arrived 30 minutes after we did, should be finishing their entrees when we walked out hungry and unserved.  Also, there was a brand new busgirl.  She was sweet, but had no training and was left to her own devices.  She was the only one who saw our unhappiness, but was obviously in no position to do anything about it.  To quote my gf, "Our romantic dinner turned the entire evening sour."  Thanks for nothing, Gina.*** #300  ***A friend read good things about Gina's Bistro, and suggested we try it together.  Soon after this, I saw that trusted Yelp friends gave high marks to this eatery.  So, my party of four soon assembled to find out for ourselves.  As a result of this visit, I am happy to report that I have added yet another fine Italian restaurant to my list of places for recurrent dining, even though there are enough spots listed already that it is getting ever harder to make this list.  Although this is my favorite cuisine, there is only so much time available to indulge in Italian dining.  So, standards are high.What are those standards?  1) Bread products of whatever type must be good or better.2) An Italian style soup such as Minestrone, Pasta Fagioli, Stracciatella, or Italian Wedding Soup, or something similar like mussels in tasty broth must be first rate.3) A Caesar or Chopped Salad must be good or better.4) Veal must be tender, and rendered delicious prepared with either sweet Marsala Sauce, creamy and cheesy Pomodoro or Marinara Sauce served Parmigiana style, with melted Mozzarella, or a little sour, salty, and tangy served with prosciutto with or without sage Saltimbocca style.  5) Pasta must be al dente and available tossed with a tasty Bolognese, Pomodoro, or exceptional Marinara Sauce, and mushrooms. 6) Available desserts must be well beyond Spumoni Ice Cream.The food at Gina's Bistro passed all qualifying tests.  Warm rustic bread was very good.  Mussels & Vongole in a spicy light Tomato Sauce was an excellent starter.  The Caesar Salad was good and tasty, with a light Caesar Dressing.  A quite tasty side of Spaghetti Bolognese with Mushrooms was prepared al dente.  Veal Saltimbocca consisted of three good-sized medallions of tender veal enrobed in melted cheese over salty prosciutto, bathing in a slightly sour and tangy sauce.  And, desserts included a very good lemony Mini-Cannoli with powdered sugar and drips of Chocolate Sauce, and a large and very tasty Chocolate Truffle also adorned with Chocolate Sauce.Seating was comfortable in an intimate space, with tables covered by burgundy tablecloths.  Service was friendly, efficient, and accompanied by a welcome Italian flair.  Even the Iced Tea was noticeably fragrant.  A nice little jewel in the desert!XXXX-1/2 stars overall!I honestly didn't come here thinking it was going to be THIS good but it was really all that and then some.  You wouldn't think a place located in a mostly deserted plaza whose best outdoor view is of a gas station would be serving such great Italian fare, but they are and it's worth checking out if you're in the neighborhood.As a lot of other Yelpers say, the atmosphere is nice and cozy.  Service was great and I think this was the only time in Vegas where we had a server that was actually from Italy.  But on a side note, how hilariously fucking awesome would it be if he were American and just doing a terrific Italian accent every night?  I would fall off my chair!!I am a sucker for any place that hand makes their pasta and they make a lot of theirs in house with the exception of spaghetti and penne.  The parpadelle pasta was insanely good!!  I had it with a tomato sauce that included prosciutto, mushrooms and 2 HUGE meatballs.  Just to avoid going completely carb crazy, we went with a veal dish cooked in lemon butter sauce and that was delicious as well.The only disappointment for us was the tiramisu which tasted a little weird so we didn't end up finishing it.  But who freakin cares when they're pushing out such terrific, well priced food?  Consider me a repeat customer!I have seen this place on many occasions, but never thought twice about trying them out until I saw the Groupon. Italian isn't my favorite cuisine, but when I'm craving carbs, it's the place to be. We arrived around 6 for an early dinner and were greeted warmly and seated. Our drink orders were taken and our waiter gave us a rundown of all the specials. He then gave us plenty of time to review the menu while he got our drinks and some bread for the table. We couldn't resist digging into the bread and it was fantastically crunchy on the outside and moist on the inside. Just like it's supposed to be. We indulged in quite a few pieces while we decided on what to order. I went with the gnocchi quattro formaggi. My fella got the mushroom chicken and my mom went with the eggplant parmigiana. Our Server was incredibly attentive and friendly, even while dealing with several other tables he was able to keep track of us and make sure everyone always had drinks filled to the brim and bread and butter on the table. Our meals came out quickly. All the pastas are made fresh and you can tell. Excellent textures and flavors. We all enjoyed our meals immensely and portions were quite generous. We all had leftovers packaged for later as well. Outstanding service, we were quite happy with our meal, I'll definitely be back to check them out again. They even gave us a 20% for our next visit, which is awesome. They'll accommodate just about any request and mentioned that if you are craving a particular type of pasta, just call them a day in advance and they will be sure to have it ready for your next visit.It was back to Gina's Bistro again over 7 months after my introduction to it.  Amazingly, the same server greeted me warmly and said he was placing my party of four at the same table as last time, and me in the same seat--which he correctly did.  He also accurately remembered what I had ordered on my one previous visit.  Eerie but great memory!  Soon after we were comfortably seated in the rather cozy, romantic dining room, and ordered several dishes, the food began to arrive.Very good lightly battered Calamari Fritti was presented with an aioli, just as I requested, followed by a large and excellent homemade cheesy Caesar Salad with fresh Romaine leaves, and Cozze e Vongole in Guazzetto, mussels and clams in a spicy tomato broth.  There was a nice balance of 6 clams and 6 mussels, and the fairly thick broth was good enough to substitute for soup.Excellent al dente spaghetti was next served with a tasty Bolognese Sauce mixed with crunchy mushrooms as a great side.  This was a fine accompaniment to my chosen entrée of Vitello Piemontese, tender medallions of veal bathed in truffle oil and topped by Gorgonzola Cheese in a reduced sweet Brandy Wine Sauce.  The veal was well pounded, fork tender, and cheesy, and the sauce luscious and silky.  We did not order dessert but received a bevy of varying complimentary chocolate-covered strawberries anyway, including ones covered by sprinkles and nuts.Except for having to ask twice for water, meal service was excellent.  After a friend's bowl of leftover Marinara Sauce had been mistakenly tossed out rather than placed in a takeout box, the chef quickly prepared and presented a full order replacement without charge.  And I received a 10% discount off the entire bill after showing my La Voce card.I knew after my initial visit that this ristorante had great potential, and this time it fulfilled its promise.  My fellow diners and I enjoyed a 5-star experience!This time a star was lost--by partly burned Bruschetta with fresh diced tomato.  Being told by our server that charring the Bruschetta somewhat was intentional in order to make the dish authentic was unconvincing and not at all believable--especially since I have not encountered blackened or partly burned Bruschetta anywhere else before or since.  A cool Chopped Caesar Salad with tasty and crunchy homemade croutons, on the other hand, was very good.  And, a hot bowl of Minestrone Soup was a superior rendition of this Italian mainstay, with carrots, spinach, carrots, tomato, peas, celery, onions, and Cavitappi in a tomato-based broth.  Fettuccine Alfredo was creamy and great in texture and taste.  But, although Veal Piemonte featured well-pounded veal, it was warm rather than hot, and had a slightly stringy consistency to it..  Service was very good, but bread plates were inexplicably removed early from the table.A true Italian loving Las Vegas living the American Dream. Riccardo is the owner of this quaint little traditional Italian restaurant. From my experience in Europe, this is almost atypical of the family dining experience in an Italian restaurant. Family recipes, cooked by (or at least supervised by)  the owner represent the ballast and hallmark of this restaurant. Riccardo bought this restaurant (From Gina) in 2012 and brought his third-generation restaurant experience with him from his birth-home of Genoa, Italy on the coast in Northern Italy near the border of Switzerland and France.This restaurant and the owner of this restaurant are a significant contribution to the Las Vegas culinary scene. This is a unique offering amongst copies of copies. The food is as authentic as the air you breathe, being recipes handed down from generations. There are few independent restaurateurs in Las Vegas who can offer such a wonderful dining experience. This is one of them at the very top of the quality scale. A superb wine list accompanies the superb dishes. A white tablecloth red wine pink sauce experience.Expect to spend $80-100 per person, order appetizers and soup and salad plus the entree and get to-go for the leftovers.Ask about the "7 day discount". "Io sono affimatto" (John Pinette)Even with as long as this place has been around, I have never heard of it. We were up in the Boca Park area craving Italian food and decided to do a quick search. Gina's popped up just a bit away, and luckily it was at a time we could go eat there since they have such limited hours. Open only 5 or 6 hours per day throughout the week for dinner, this restaurant has fairly limited seating and per the website suggests reservations. When we walked in on a Sunday around 7pm, there were only a few tables taken and we got seated right away. There's not much in the restaurant besides tables and a small waiting area, but it's a dark and intimate setting that would make for a great date night. About the only downside to the location is that their bathroom is "outside". You have to walk out of the restaurant into a separated bathroom area, similar to how some gas stations are set up.After being sat, we were greeted by Riccardo, who I believe is also a part owner. If you can't tell by his accent, he is from Italy and has a lot of experience in Italian cuisine. He explained some things on the menu and when I questioned him on a few choices I was considering, he suggested my secondary choice of the Strozzapreti alla Norcina. The dish which he said is extremely popular in his hometown features hand rolled pasta with a sausage ragu in a cream based sauce. Similar to a dumpling like texture, the strozzapreti noodles are thick and were cooked perfectly. Being that they're hand rolled, there's a small section in the middle that acts almost like a bowl for the sauce. Their cream sauce is light, but has great flavor and has a hint of truffle oil in it as well. With the sausage mixed in, it's makes a perfect combination for a very meaty and flavorful pasta dish. We also ordered a piece of their NY style cheesecake to share, and were pleasantly surprised. Sticking with the same theme as the rest of their menu, the cheesecake is made in house and was extremely tasty. The crust was a nice thick and buttery graham cracker that wasn't too hard and added perfect texture. The cheesecake itself was rich and it didn't have that chalky or pasty type of texture you find at a lot of restaurants. Drizzled lightly with chocolate sauce and fresh whipped cream, I'd highly recommend a slice to finish out your meal.Alongside excellent service and food, the prices here aren't one bit questionable for the quality. I noticed some other reviews suggest that you'll be spending a big chunk of change, which might be true if you're ordering apps, drinks, desserts, etc. But we walked out of there for just a little over $60 including tip. Not even taking into consideration the area, that's a price I wouldn't hesitate paying over and over again. Personally, I'm nowhere near finishing off my long list of Italian restaurant bookmarks, but if you're looking for a solid and authentic Italian meal, check out Gina's Bistro...you won't be disappointed.Items Selected:Bread, Butter, Olive Oil, BalsamicArancini - Arborio rice filled with bolognese sauce, peas, and mozzarella, breaded, fried and served hot w/marinara sauceAntipasto Italiano (for 2) - Prosciutto Parma, salame, cheeses, and olivesMelanzane alla Parmigiana - Oven baked, breaded eggplant w/marinara sauce and mozzarella served w/side of angelhair spaghetti in marinaraPollo alla Parmigiana - Breaded chicken baked w/ marinara sauce and mozzarella cheese served w/side of angelhair spaghetti in marinaraGnocchi ai 4 Formaggi - Potatoes & flour dumpling in a four cheeses sauceStrozzapreti alla Norcina - Priest choker' elongated hand rolled pasta, fresh sausage ragu in a tomato cream & truffle oilZiti alla Salsiccia e Mozzarella - Hand Rolled Ziti w/ Italian Sausage, Baked with tomato sauce and mozzarella cheeseDouble Espresso on IceTiramisuCannoliTucked away on South Durango in a small shopping complex, just like many local gems that those merely visiting Sin City will never even know to exist, Gina's Bistro is one of those mom n' pop places I'd passed by a hundred times before finally deciding to stop in and touting "authentic Italian recipes" amidst a setting that vibes of an older couple's home the experience is one of well crafted food at a good price, while service ranks amongst the very best in Vegas...and bearing mind the city in which we live, not in a 'damned by faint praise' way.Truly the sort of place where 'dining out' feels much more like 'eating dinner in the house of an old friend,' a visit to Gina's Bistro first sees the glint of a small kitchen tucked behind the hostess stand and quickly seated at a cozy four-top flanked in old photos and paintings it was mere moments before water was poured and perusing the menu while chewing crusty bread served alongside butter, olive oil, and balsamic a list of several specials was recited, a simply grilled fish atop orzo tempting though the housemade pasta inevitably got the nod.Treated to soft Italian opera, the volume appropriate to shroud conversation without ever trending loud, it was not long before a duo of appetizers would arrive and although I personally would have not ordered the $19 Antipasto given the unexciting options, both the prosciutto and olives proved pleasant and sharable while a somewhat undersized duo of arancini proved far more interesting, though a bit more melted cheese and less ground meat would have certainly been preferred.Moving on to entrees, an order of five proving a bit aggressive for just three diners when taking into account bowls of angelhair served with both plates of parm, it was with share-plates replenished and bread relinquished that a vast tasting began, the hand formed gnocchi a bit overcooked and sticky beneath rich cheese sauce while both ziti and priest-choker pasta were prepared perfectly al dente with no lack of flavor from housemade Italian sausage to be found.Having already noted the duo of plates served 'alla Parmigiana,' it was perhaps an unfortunate choice to do both items on the same day alongside so much other food, for as good as the baked eggplant iteration was with a light breading overlying the baked vegetable and bold tomato sauce draped in cheese, the thinly pounded chicken was almost entirely flavorless beneath the same accoutrements, a slight oiliness reserving me to only a few bites, though by the end of the meal the plate - like all the others - was clean.Limited in sweets, the options comprising small, conservative classics with $5 prices perhaps a bit much when compared to other similar spots in the city, it was a single cannoli with surprisingly delicate filling that joined an equally light tiramisu alongside coffee, and chatting with friends as a few more locals filtered in to half-fill the seating one really couldn't help but see the pride in both the maitre d' and waiter's faces as they circulated the room warmly welcoming each guest, water refilled for the umpteenth time without request as lit candles were placed at the center of each table.Setting aside the fact that many of the classic plates are made using store bought dried pasta, and focusing mostly on what the mother and nephew team is doing in house, Gina's Bistro is the sort of restaurant unlikely to wow but happy to please, the service and setting "Un-Vegasy" in the best of ways while the food is often times quite good, particularly considering the price.

If I could give them NO stars, I would.We have eaten at the BluBurger location on Jomax and had a great experience.  Good food, decent service, no complaints., so when a new location opened up around the corner from our house we decided to check it out with our neighbors and their 2 kids.I arrived first and went to put our name in for a table but instead I waited.  And waited.  And waited some more.  The hostess finally came over and when I requested a table for 4 adults and 2 kids, she let out a sigh and told me that they were completely backed up and could not seat us.  Confused, I scanned the dining room and counted no less than 4 empty tables and 3 teenaged waiters milling around aimlessly.  Dude, the hostess hasn't even met my neighbors kids yet and she was already throwing us out!  At this time, the rest of my party arrived and I let them know what the hostess told me.  My husband walked over to her and asked why she wouldn't seat us mentioning the open tables.  The hostess told us that they were short staffed and backed up in the kitchen but she will seat us anyway.  She also added that we would get no service, not even water, for 20 minutes or more.  WTF.  I have never in my life encountered such a thing in any restaurant - especially one that was newly opened, the smell of fresh paint still in the air.  Certainly not the way to treat potential customers.  Instead of sticking around and starving, we all ended up at Pei Wei a few steps away.Apparantly we weren't the only ones annoyed with the rudeness of BluBurger.  Within minutes of us sitting down at Pei Wei, 3 other groups from BluBurger walked through the doors.  They got tired of waiting as well.So, can't comment of the food at this particular location but the attitude that we got there was so atrocious that we will not be going back.  Ever.I'm hoping that someone at the Health Department reads this and is as alarmed as I am about what I witnessed at BluBurger last night.I was sitting at the bar and ordered a cheeseburger with no add-ons - so no lettuce, tomato, any of that jazz. Literally within three minutes of placing my order the bartender put a plate in front of me. Surprised by the speed but not thinking much of it I ate a couple of sweet potato fries, then noticed that "my" burger was awfully dressed up. I lifted the bun up with fingers I just wiped my runny nose with (I know, I'm totally gross but I thought it was my food) and saw that it was not what I ordered. At the very same time the bartender came hurrying back, saying she accidentally gave me someone else's order.As she whisked it away I explained that she'd have to make it over again because I already touched it and I have a cold. She kind of laughed and brought the plate back to the kitchen window. I watched while the cook did nothing more than put the big toothpick back into to bun and sent the contaminated plate out to the unsuspecting diner.I don't know if the bartender didn't tell the cook what I said about already touching it and having a cold, or if neither of them cared. What I do know, however, is that is really, really gross, and if I knew that I was eating someone else's snot germs I'd barf.So if you ate at BluBurger last night and you develop a cold this weekend, now you know why.

My husband & I have been avid BWW goer's ever since we moved to Gilbert 3 years ago. We frequented the McQueen & Elliot location almost once a week the entire time we lived nearby.  The wings are awesome and it's the best place to watch any kind of sports. Every time friends come in town we take them to Thursday night $.50 wings & $3 you-call-its. We have since moved to East Mesa and last night two good friends where in town visiting. We were on our way home when they asked about BWW and said they had been really looking forward to making a trip there while they were in town.It was 12:30 am and we were driving nearby this location. I wasn't sure what time they closed so I looked up the number on my phone quickly and called to ask. Someone answered the phone and said "we close at 1." We knew we were cutting it close but were craving wings so we decided we would run in, order wings togo, have one round of drinks while they were being cooked and make it out right at closing. We have all worked in the service industry so we are very cognizant of common restaurant courtesy and always tip extremely well.When we walked in we were immediately faced with the manager, Shana I believe, who very rudely said "we are closed." My husband looked at his phone and said it is only 12:40 and we just called and someone told us you close at 1. She said she was indeed the person who answered the phone and her clock actually said it was 12:55 and they are closed. We explained our intention of ordering togo and having one drink and she again very rudely  said the bar was absolutely off limits they did last call 20 minutes ago and if we HAD to order food it we would be waiting for awhile because she would have to "refire" up the kitchen and get everything back out since its all been cleaned up already. At this point we had no intention of staying and were really offended at how we were being treated. We calmly explained we would have appreciated if she had been truthful with us on the phone. If she had simply replied that they close at 1 but the kitchen has already cleaned up and last call for the bar was 20 minutes ago we would not have even wasted the time to drive there. She did not apologize and was still speaking to us with a ridiculous attitude. Everyone was frustrated at this point and as we started to a leave a server that had walked up earlier called my husband an "asshole". This was completely appalling, so unnecessary, absolutely undeserved and insanely unprofessional. We will NEVER go back to this location, if you are craving BWW stop in to the McQueen & Elliot location where all of the staff are super friendly, accommodating and professional.

Yay! I FINALLY made it here to have lunch! I am such a lazy slacker that the 5 mile drive from work has been holding me back.  But SO glad I finally went.Got the Yelp special mocha frappe (vegan, with soy).  Awesomeness points - they don't charge extra for soy (or rice) milk! (You can also get almond milk for a bit extra.)Ordered the tofurkey sandwich (veganized - tofurkey, vegan cheez, tomato, spinach, red bell pepper, hummus on whole grain bread) and my friend got the An Alien Left a Burrito in the Middle East (hehehe), veganized - spinach tortilla w/ beans, vegan cheese, hummus, couscous, and veggies.  I had a bite and it was nummers! I'm gonna get that next time for sure. They also have a black bean sandwich (not veganizable) and breakfast items (can't wait to try the breakfast burrito!).  Reasonably priced coffee drinks, lots of teas (including a very tasty local organic "Summer Orchard").Very friendly staff, and we got our food and drinks really quickly.  Was surprised at how inexpensive it was, bonus! Looks like it would be a fun place to hang out with a few friends on one of the sofas (they had several board games). The only disappointment was the vegan brownie; not bad -- just tasted too "healthy."  Guessing it was sweetened with dates? Which is cool if you're looking for natural sugar, but I like my vegan desserts to taste like junk food. :)Will be coming here on the regular from now on!First time here and writing this review chillin' inside Sunrise Coffee right now.  Couldn't wait to write a review because I just had the best effing egg croissant in my life right now!  At first I was like wow $5 fro a breakfast sandwich and the moment I took my first bite I was like oh sh*t, this egg sandwich is hella good.  The croissant was soft enough that it just melts in your mouth,  Egg was scrambled just right.  It came with avocados and tomato and something that I have never had or seen before in a sandwich. It wasn't lettuce but instead leaves.  Yes, like leaves on trees.  Anyone that has been here before know what these green leaves are?  Reason I'm asking is I'm going to attempt to see if i can make a sandwich similar to this at home.And oh, they serve coffee as well, haha.  Free WiFi too along with good music in the background because any place that plays nightmare on wax is a def' thumbs up in my book. They do spoken words (open mic poetry session) I believe every monday night from what I know of before, but I don't know if it still goes on as of now.Aight ya'll, back to studying.This place is AWESOME!  Aside from the fact that it's one of those rare-in-Vegas artsy-farsty bohemian hangout-type coffee shops, with bookshelves full o'crappy old paperbacks and lots of comfy seating...it also serves A*M*A*Z*I*N*G food! I had the "Aliens Kidnapped a Burrito From the Middle East" and it was nothing short of jaw-dropping! Crammed full of healthy shit like fresh spinach leaves, avocado, couscous and hummus...very hard to find quick, healthy eats like that, and it was only $5.99. I will DEFINITELY be spending more time here. It's become a destination thing for me -- if I ever happen to be in that part of town, I will make a point to go there. It was that good!! I can't say enough fabulous things about this place!!We're in the desert people.  This ain't Seattle.  And with the lack of cold and wet comes a lack of inviting public (indoor) spaces to sit and talk, sit and read, or sit and work--otherwise known as the local coffee shop.  Which is the part of the reason that I am such a huge cheerleader for Sunrise Coffee and tell everyone that they should drive to Sunrise no matter what side of town they live on.  Sunrise is one of the only independent coffee shops in Vegas.  And they've done a great job making a caffeinated space to inspire creativity, wakefulness, conversation, and community.  It's a space that's rare in Vegas.  But it's also an inviting space with the options of comfy chairs, tables, outlets to plug in a laptop, and at least one larger table for a group meeting.Beyond the space, Sunrise offers great coffee (organic, fair trade, and well-roasted), delicious steamed milk coffee drinks (one of the few places in town offering a cafe au lait and Mexican hot chocolate).  And if you want a healthier breakfast option or vegan food options, they've got you covered.  Bottom line: I'm in love with Sunrise.  It's proof that we can have the sun and outdoors of the desert and not give up the cozy nooks and tasty warm drinks of the colder cities.My ultimate favorite coffee shop! REAL coffee, none of that watered down starbucks stuff and i'm not a starbucks snob at all, this place is just better..in almost every aspect haha. I'm not even really an avid  coffee drinker but their coffee actually has a delicious, rich flavor and even gives me the caffeine I need (gives me a better boost than 5 hour energy). You can also pick up a bag of their mothership coffee for home :)My favorite to get is their iced truffle berry. It's raspberry chocolate flavored coffee and wow it's just soo addicting! I also enjoy their smore, butter beer (sounds weird but trust me, it's amazing), white mocha, mint mocha, caramel, creme brulee and well, I guess all of their flavors haha! Everything I've tried has been great including their nomnom and alien burrito! I'm not vegan or vegetarian but those burritos were soo good that I don't feel like I'm missing out on any meat. They also have a great selection of teas and pastries. The prices are great as well! My large iced truffle berry is under $5 and they also offer a "happy hour", I have to double check what time it starts though, sorry! All of the workers are really friendly, and 95% of the time has been pretty fast. The inside is very cozy, and they also have a little outdoor seating area. Sometimes it's hard to find a spot because a lot of people like to bring their laptops and work but it's always nice just to to-go and have a picnic across the street at sunset park. I just love this place :)Sunrise Coffee is a golden ray of blissful warmth to get you moving in the right direction!Sunrise is a local coffee house that excels at customer service while offering a nice selection of quality options.They are probably best known for their Mothership Roasters Coffee, but they also have several good loose leaf teas that are sure to please. I also look forward to enjoying one of their tasty wraps. The Alien (Left a Burrito in the Midwest) is my go-to option.  It's a vegetarian option that leaves me satisfied and never missing meat. The Alien consists of a tortilla wrap with couscous, beans, cheese, hummus, spinach, tomato, avocado, and red bell pepper. If I'm not eating eating the Alien I am probably enjoying the similar Nomnom Breakfast Burrito featuring a tortilla, eggs, vegetarian beans, potatoes, cheese, fresh spinach, tomatoes, avocados, sour cream and a bit of cream cheese. The real beauty for me is my wife! Having breakfast with her is divine on its own, but one of her numerous positive qualities happens to be her generosity. At Sunrise Coffee it pays dividends as bites of what she's eating--normally the Multigrain Egg Sandwich. I would order this from time-to-time if not for the fact that I get to enjoy a couple bites of this anyway due to on my previous ability to woo such an incredible partner.Sunrise Coffee is located on Sunset in a typical Vegas strip mall that does nothing on its own to entice you to its businesses, but once you make it in the door, Sunrise offers a clean and comfortable environment to meet a friend or get some work done. Needless to say it is one of my favorite coffee shops around.When a person leaves a review that is less than favorable for a business, the owners have two choices.1.  They can lash out, and post awful things in response, which I've seen a number of businesses do.2.  They can reach out privately to the customer, and sincerely apologize, (also stating that they will be having a meeting to correct the behavior...)This is how I found myself back at Sunrise Coffee so soon after my visit a couple of weeks ago.  I was less than impressed then, but the day after I posted my review, I was contacted by the owner.  He apologized profusely and sincerely, and stated that there would be a meeting to address what I had referred to as "snarky attitudes."That impressed me.  For an owner to reach out on a personal level, well...that scores big points with me.  Well. Whether it was the meeting, or I just happened to be there on an off day last time, today's visit was night and day. I walked in, and the vibe was better.The shop was packed, but employees were smiling...even the girl who was dealing with a rather difficult sounding customer was super sweet.Service was polite.  Friendly...everything I had expected!The coffee, again, was delicious.  Today I tried the Truffleberry, and wowza, is THAT delicious!I also tried a carrot cake muffin, which to me was a little dry, but had an all around good flavor.  Sunrise, you've 100% redeemed yourself.  I intend fully to visit again, and maybe even sit with a good book or my knitting some weekend.The pour over coffee I ordered was not very good. I think the beans are of lower quality than I am used to and the water may have been too hot when poured. I've been brewing pour over at home for years and that's a mistake I made early in the game. It happens. The iced coffee my wife ordered was not great either. Bitter after taste isn't exactly our cup of tea. My previous review, which I deleted for some odd reason, was pegged by the manager as narcissistic and I was labeled as a mean person hiding behind the internet. To that I will say that I understand the manager of a business wants to support her staff and that's fantastic. More power to you. I see that this business has 4.5 stars so it shouldn't be too difficult to accept that not everyone loves your product. I didnt have a good experience and I am certain that I am allowed to express my opinion because after all, Yelp is an application that is all about sharing. Don't get too upset about that and please read some of my reviews. When I like a business, I gush and give great reviews. When I don't like a business I tell the truth about it and that's something I can't apologize for.Wow. I guess it's been a few years since I've visited Sunrise Coffee. I like what they've done with the place. Much more seating inside and a large covered patio outside.I stopped by because I had run out of coffee beans. When I visited Colorado River Coffee Roasters a couple of years ago, they told me that Sunrise was no longer their customer because they started roasting their own beans. As it turns out, Sunrise will soon open up a separate location for their Mothership Coffee Roasters brand. But for now, you can buy the beans at Sunrise.As I walk in, I see that they have four varieties available, but nothing specifically marked as an espresso blend. So I ask the guy for a recommendation. Long story short, I went with the Guatemala Café Femenino. It's organic, fair trade, and all women farmers? Interesting. Anyway, the latte I made this morning was absolutely delicious. Good job women farmers!A nice touch was that my cup of cold brew coffee was on the house thanks to my purchase of beans. To top it off, their cold brew was perfectly tasty and refreshing.It's definitely nice to have a quality local spot to grab freshly roasted beans. Sunrise Coffee and the upcoming Mothership Coffee Roasters just might be my new go to spots.Items Selected:Strawberry Corriander MuffinBanana Walnut MuffinPineapple Cinnamon RollDrip CoffeeVisited occasionally in the past for coffee en route to the office, but overlooked for pastries as items were previously outsourced, a return visit to Sunrise Coffee was planned the moment rumor was heard that all muffins, cookies, and confections were now crafted by the team at sister-shop Mothership; plans to meet owner Juanny Romero at 9:00am just a mile down the street prompting an early stop that showed the brew as bold as ever while the relaxed vibe and free WiFi offered impetus to stick around and enjoy a trio of pastries crafted with top tier ingredients and balance bolstered by creativity as well as skill.A icon of the local coffee culture since 2008, and as such a veritable forefather to the current scene slowly creeping towards the Strip and Western Suburbs, Sunrise Coffee has long featured the locally roasted Mothership brand of beans and with fanciful lattes, espressos, cappuccinos, pour-overs, and presses available it was instead in a medium cup of drip that I invested, the effect of light roasting readily apparent even in the simplest option as fig and caramel tones coated the tongue,Moving on to pastries, each item individually plated by one of four friendly youngsters tasked with everything from barrista duties to crafting sandwiches from organic produce sourced from a farm in California, the glass case at Sunrise is a bit more straightforward than the counter of Mothership, but with some similarities and a focus on balanced flavors the only question becomes where best to invest one's appetite, the seasonal cinnamon roll a good first choice as caramelized pineapple finds balance in light yeast with the sort of frosting that never seems cloying, but rather a semi-sweet delivery mechanism for the cinnamon and butter tones beneath.Passing on a scone that had previously wowed on Green Valley Parkway, instead choosing to focus on muffins exclusive to Sunrise, it was with bites of the strawberry and  corriander iteration that the tasting progressed, and with a supple crumb and flavors that bridged savory to natural sweetness the follow-up was no less remarkable, the bitterness of dark walnuts proving an admirable foil to overripe bananas as  homey autumnal notes rang through with aplomb.Now perhaps best judged as the casual sibling of brainy sister Mothership, Sunrise Coffee Roasters continues to turn out some of the city's best brews, and for those looking to sit, sip, savor, and perhaps enjoy a sandwich there are few better places to do so in town.LIKES- Very friendly and laidback employees! It feels like I'm hanging out with friends who just happen to make coffee and suck money out of my credit card while doing so- Every drink I have tasted is either good or really good, which is rare since I'm pretty picky when it comes to coffee- Seating and outlets!- Outdoor seating for nicer weather; also dog-friendly- Organized and visually appealing menu- Prices affordable especially for the quality you get- Drive-thru available for those in a rush but I'm sure that can't be fun for employeesDISLIKES- The horrible traffic due to construction- It can get crowded aka lack of seating aka don't come in a huge group (a testament to their popularity)- Closes early (not a surprise for a coffee shop of course, but it's nice to study at midnight sometimes)My personal favorite: Truffle berry latte less sweet! Harmonious blend of raspberry and chocolate.Who needs proper sentences anyway? I decided to just make a list of some things I like and dislike about Sunrise because If i were to go into every detail it would be an essay and I am sooo done with school.

Review Text :
When my husband and I moved to South Phoenix from the Bay Area, we were used to having Asian food three or four times a week. In an average month, we'd get Thai takeout five or six times, have Chinese delivered, enjoy Vietnamese for a casual lunch, fill up on dim sum on a weekend morning, and splurge on tons of sushi and grilled fish/meat at a Japanese restaurant. Needless to say, since moving to south Phoenix, we haven't had Asian food with nearly as much frequency. Although we have found some great Asian restaurants outside of our area, our options within a 10-15 minute range have been limited to Canton Wong #8 (a good but standard to-go Chinese joint) and Sun Asian Kitchen (a Chinese restaurant that bills itself as fine dining but is low on taste and quality). Enter Pan Asia Sushi Chinese Fusion, which just opened this past week in the new center on the southeast corner of 24th and Baseline. We've been eagerly anticipating its opening but were afraid to get too excited. After all, it could have just as easily turned out as bad as Sun Kitchen. Based on the very generic name, we also feared that it might be some sort of buffet (as if we don't already have enough of those in this area!). Well, we tried the restaurant last night, and it totally blew us away! The place definitely has some kinks to work out - the timing of food service was a bit off (we got our Chinese entree before our sushi), the communication between the bus boys and the servers was a little off, and the menu was a little confusing - but the decor is thoughtful and attractive (we especially loved the crystal light fixtures and the patterned wash basins in the bathrooms), the employees are friendly, and most importantly, the food is freaking incredible! For our main dish, we ordered the Mongolian Beef ($9) off of the Chinese menu. Even though they had some much more interesting dishes (one that stood out was the Crispy Beef with Plum Sauce), we like to start with something simple so that we can determine whether the ingredients used are fresh. Well, Pan Asia passed the test on that count! The beef was literally the best quality beef I've ever had in a Chinese dish - it was tender and super-flavorful. We were left wondering if they used filet! The vegetables were also bright and fresh. Best of all, the brown sauce was spicy - it's rare for a Chinese place to have a brown sauce be spicy by default, but we loved the kick and appreciated that they didn't dumb the dish down for an Americanized palatte. As if the entree weren't good enough, our three sushi orders (Las Vegas Roll, Philadelphia Roll, and the Yama Roll) were made with fresh and high-quality fish, well-rolled (a lot of places don't bother to actually roll the rolls well!), and artfully presented. We especially loved the unexpected touches on the dishes - swirls of eel sauce, dots of mango puree, and thinly sliced scallions. If you're not into the sweeter, fancier rolls, you may want to avoid these rolls and stick with some of the basics on the menu (they have a large nigiri/sashimi section, as well as some simple/more traditional rolls), but we really enjoyed the more inventive rolls, and from the freshness of the ingredients in the rolls we ordered, I imagine that the simpler, more fish-focused sushi items would also be really enjoyable. We are so glad that this place opened in our area - now we can go to one spot and get both high-quality Chinese and sushi! This combination may prove useful for groups or couples with varying tastes. According to our server, a liquor license is coming soon. Since we love cocktails just as much as we love good Chinese and sushi, that's great news! In the meantime, though, we'll definitely be back as often as possible. Pan Asia isn't just good for the area - it's just plain good!Was enticed to have dinner here when one of the owners mentioned that on the 14th and 28th of this month the restaurant features 50% off.  Don't know if this is every month... I thought it would be 50% off everything on the menu, but upon arrival was given a menu with a few items that are 50% or almost 50% off.  I asked her if they use rice wine vinegar for their sushi rice, and she said yes.  I was quite hopeful to see if they've improved on it!The restaurant was busy, and there were at least three sushi chefs busily working the sushi bar.  I usually try to dine at sushi counters of Japanese restaurants, but the seats here are too low for me to enjoy the experience.  Measuring at 5'0", I know I'm a shrimp, but the counter here is too low for ANYONE to be able to watch the chefs in action, so after trying one more time to sit there tonight, I got up immediately and sat at the bar.After studying the menus and asking questions, I finally settled on the Norway Pepper Salmon (reg. $5, now $3) and The Bomb (reg. $15, now $9).  The restaurant was quite busy- it took at least 25 minutes before the two-piece salmon sushi arrived.  The presentation was quite pretty, with an orchid and a couple of sauces (pineapple and raspberry) for garnishes, but the sauces did not add anything to the flavor of the salmon.  I was quite hopeful that the rice would be much better this time- I met another owner, John, who told me that he'd read a review on a blog where the reviewer mentioned something about the rice.  However, the rice tasted just like it did on my second visit.  He did come by to inquire about the rice and said he'd try to find out what the problem was.Since I found "The Bomb" (35 minutes or more wait-time) under the the Sushi/Rolls menu (the description stated "baked spicy scallop with salmon wrapped spicy tuna"), I expected to see rice in this dish, but the presentation was neither in sushi- nor hand-roll fashion, just said ingredients.  No matter- I still enjoyed it- so many textures here!  I loved the plumpness of the scallops.  I particularly liked how they weren't chopped into tiny pieces like I've experienced them in other venues.  I didn't find the tuna to be spicy at all.  It was, however, served tartare-style, and so added another textural component to the dish.  The salmon pieces were beautiful to behold and sliced thick, yet were velvety-smooth on the tongue and melted in my mouth!  Very fresh-tasting; no fishy aftertaste at all.I also ordered the Pan Asia Beefsteak and Grilled Salmon entree under the Chinese menu (reg. $26, now $13) to go.  While I detected cornstarch in the sauces that covered them, I did find the couple of beef pieces, nicely peppered, and the sliver of salmon I tasted to be delicious!  Definitely something worth checking out on the 50% price-plan.  I did find it strange that this entree didn't come with rice, either; instead, orange slices were wedged between the salmon and the beef.  BTW, I was able to taste a little bit of the green tea ice cream served here... it is EXQUISITE!  I was tempted to order some for take-out...  From what I gathered, the dessert costs $6 and is served with a warmed banana, a sauce, and whip cream.  A single scoop will set you back $4.I was sitting at work wondering what the heck to eat for lunch. I hopped on Yelp, popped in my work addy and did a search. After getting a few results, I settled on trying Pan Asia. I hopped in the g-ride and headed over. When I walked in to this strip mall location, I was very surprised. This was modern and sleek decor with flat panel TVs and cool music bumping over head. Wow! I decided to sit at the bar for my meal. I was STARVING so I chose to go with the deluxe sushi combo. I was just drinking water and had to trouble 2 people to finally obtain a lemon for my drink. It was a slight annoyance. When my plate arrived, I was delighted by the presentation. On the platter were 2 pieces of yellowtail , a salmon a tuna, a black pepper tuna and the dish usually comes with 8 pieces of spicy tuna roll, but I asked for spicy yellowtail instead. I was so glad that I was starving! The quality of the fish at Pan Asia is so-so. It isn't bad, but it's not without a bit of aftertaste and certainly isn't the highest quality. Again, you won't get sick, or you won't be horrified by the sushi, it's just middle grade. On my second visit, I got to try the "Fire Roll" which is a California roll inside, sauteed garlic shrimp all covered with eel sauce and Bacardi 151 lit on fire. It makes a great presentation and is very tasty for those who don't enjoy raw fish. I would highly suggest this place for run-of-the-mill sushi. I would especially suggest it for those who are with fellow diners who do not eat sushi as Pan Asia offers a full menu of Chinese cuisine. I know that Pan Asia will become one of my regular lunch spots for a quick sushi fix!

Restaurant name  Chima Brazilian Steakhouse
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
I am Brazilian and this place is a bit overratedLet me start telling you about my background. I am from the southernmost state of Brazil, Rio Grande do Sul, where the authentic "churrasco" is from. While I cannot find a really authentic place here in the US (because they are not run by authentic gauchos from the south) there are many others that can serve a delicious churrasco. Chima does delivers a delicious meal, however, for their price range I am obligated to compare them to other upscale "churrascarias" like Fogo de Chao, Plataforma (NYC) and Texas de Brazil. Chima is probably 4th in the list. I rated them this low because for the price they do charge in Charlotte (because they can) is not compatible with the quality of service and meat variety we get in these other upscale churrascarias. This place is surprising the busiest restaurant in Charlotte and I do see why. Where in uptown you pay $50 and can taste so many different cuts of beef? Exactly! But like I said before, being in other churrascarias I think that Chima is overrated as they are trying to compare themselves to Fogo de Chao, which they are not.It is still an excellent experience if you have never been, but as a Brazilian I rarely go because with the price tag they have, we can have an outstanding meal in other steakhouses around uptown.Sides are nothing too special, fried polentas are good but way worse than Fogo de Chao.Chima also does not open for lunch (except in special days) and when they open for lunch they usually charge $37 however they do reduce the variety of cuts and also their service is not too good. As an example, in Miami, Fogo de Chao charges $30 for lunch and they have the exactly same menu as dinner.They also do not feature chicken hearts (which may sound yucky but it is a must have in churrascarias) and they also marinate the beef with garlic in some cuts which is an assassination to the method of preparing the food. The garlic is to mask the bad taste of the beef cut. A real beef cut is seasoned with sea salt only (maybe some pepper) and not with garlic. There was even a project of "law" in southern Brazil that to be called churrasco only Sea Salt should be used, no garlic, no pepper.Desserts are expensive and not required. In Brazil, churrascarias often don't charge for deserts and you would have a buffet. Some upscale churrascarias charge for it.

70+ year old hostess Shelby: "Where does a one-legged waitress work" Us: *Blank stares* Shelby: "IHOP" Yeah... it was one of those nights. I was actually really impressed with this particular Denny's. Both the hostess and our waitress were EXTREMELY nice and accommodating, especially since we were a large, obnoxiously drunken group of people stumbling in after midnight. The food came out quick and correct, my cup was never empty and the booth made for a nice resting place for my head. Thanks Denny's. Without my delicious chocolate milkshake and 2 egg breakfast I would have puked and passed out in the parking lot.Everyone knows what Denny's is and Denny's is no 4 star establishment; however this Denny's gets 4 stars for a Denny's.We stumbled in most of us drunk and obnoxious. We were seated quickly by the funniest hostess ever to work at a Denny's. She began telling us jokes that you can read in the other reviews. I mentioned we needed six jokes hoping we would each have one for our reviews. "Sex jokes or six jokes?" She asked."Six jokes.""Sex jokes?"Six jokes...S-I-X.""You don't spell sex with an I....must have been awhile eh sweetie?"Keep in mind this lady has to be around her 60s.The service was enough to boost this place up but on top of it I was introduced to their buffalo chicken sandwich..and it is good. Seriously I swear. It is still a Denny's though.

Restaurant name  Switch Steak

Review Text :
Transformers!  More than meats the eye.  Switch is known for the way the walls change every 15-30 mins.  I kid u not.  Walls come out of the ground up, walls come from ceiling down, the ceiling transforms and the light fixtures change.  I'll have to admit while it does feel like a gimmick, that is one expensive ass gimmick.  Think about the motors and rotors and mechanics to make everything so fluid and change with the beat... On to the food, the more important part.  Summer truffle risotto.  Holy crap those pieces of truffle are large.  With  more mushrooms and sugar peas.  The texture rolls on the tongue and slides into the stomach.   Ribeye is tender and quite gigantic.  Scallops are fresh and bathed in a delightful sweet pea verjus sauce, topped with mushrooms corn and more peas.  The desserts are not to be missed either.  Picture perfect and perfect tasting donut holes and masterpieces of art.Me and my friends were starving and found this place through the list of restaurants that were in hotel. We made our reservation last minute on a Saturday night and the only tables they had were on the patio, which is right next to Surrender nightclub or Encore Beach Club during the day. The patio was pretty and the view of the nightclub and the pool at night was beautiful. We thought it was going to be cold but it wasn't cold at all. Our first waiter was really rude and condescending, I was simply trying to order for 3 people including myself because we all wanted the same entree. But, for some reason he got confused or pretended to be confused to make me feel stupid because there was nothing complicated about it. Then a friend was just asking for his opinion on what seafood to get and he goes ,"You mean you want fish?" He continued to repeat three times, like are you freakin retarded! Fish is part of the seafood family numb nuts. I got fed up with the waiter and as he walked by I said, "I'm going to yelp this!" So why would I give this place 4 stars if we had such a condescending waiter? Well because I guess the guy heard me and they switched our waiters to someone who was super nice and talkative. After our new waiter, we all calmed down and we were as happy as can be because the food was good and our waiter was nice! =) I had the chicken and it was really good, usually chicken is really dry and mine was really moist and flavorful! I tried some of my friends steak and it was also really good!Minus the d bag waiter we first had, the experience here was good!Why Steve Wynn needed two top flight steakhouses in a single resort is beyond me.  Makes choosing so hard and forces a comparison.SWITCH elevates steakhouse dining to an elegant affair.  Plate presentation is very modern; if you eat with your eyes, this place wins over SW.Prices are higher than SW.  The American kobe beef carpaccio is excellent.  It is served Italian style with a parsley pesto, porcini mushrooms, arugula, and Parmesan cheese.  YumI don't usually order seafood at a steak place but had to try the monk fish.  Wow.  Perfect.  The  micro herbs and horseradish just make the dish.The steaks are excellent.  The aging of the corn fed beef really brings out the beef flavors.  The dry aged new york strip is incredible.  Nutty with blue cheese notes.  The NY strip steak flight is also a must try.  You get to try all three offerings of SWITCH side by side.  Its like a mini beef tasting!  Its a lot of fun but recommend you share it.  Sides are more inventive than at SW.  The cauliflower gratin, woodland mushrooms, and switch ratatouille are all good choices and all pair well with the dry aged beef.Service is excellent.The wine selection is vast.  Prices are a little high by Vegas standards.Great restaurant.Switch Steak. A steak house located inside Encore, right next to Surrender. Now this ain't your ordinary steakhouse. Afterall this is Vegas, and nothing in Vegas is ordinary. At Switch Steak, you get ever so timely environment changes (every 20 minutes) and fantastic food. I personally loved the decor, over the top vegas style! And every 20 minutes the lights will dim and dramatic music will play and the restaurant will literally change in front of your eyes. The ceiling changes or a new wall will come up....it's very impressive. The food here was excellent!! I ordered a 14 oz steak...medium rare and it was cooked perfectly: http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=h4o8e_Xbca2kXQO_vzOqgg&select=iU01tRSIP2nvA_rr008YuQSteak was about $56 and sides were 10 bucks a pop. But definitely worth every penny! My only complaint was the smell. It was subtle but lingered throughout the whole meal. At the end we figured out it was the leather placemats that were wiped with dirty rags...because it smelled like old dirty rags! Minus 1 star! I would definitely recommend this place for a special occasion or if you wanted a dramatic dinner. Just think of it as a transformers restaurant! Definitely more than meets the eye!

this bar is awesome! Ive been coming to Bilbos for a few years now and it never fails. With an endless selection of beers to the fun game of shuffle board you will have an awesome time here. The bartenders always provide great service and the jukebox playing great music you will love this place. Why only 4 stars? it tends to get pretty smokey inside when there are a lot of people. Oh yea! and the chicken fingers with the volcano sauce is amazing. super spicy!

It's all about execution, baby!  As an operations guy I really appreciate the execution I see at In & Out burger again and again.  Since moving to AZ I have made probably 15 total visits to In & Out burger spread over 5-6 locations.  Not once has there been the slightest mistake on my order.Not once has an employee been anything less than polite and efficient.While In & Out is not the greatest burger on earth it is pretty good and has been 100% consistent across locations and visits.That's execution, baby.Stark contrast to a local McDonald's where it has actually become an amusing stat for us to follow.  They have not gotten an order right for us.  Ever.The five stars is because this is the BEST fast food burger joint in the USA.The food is hot and fresh, the menu is small so it keeps things simple and dang if the burgers are mouthwatering delicious.  This is the best thing to come out of california next to fake boobs.Parking is a pain, and there is usually a line (inside).  Avoid at all costs at lunchtime, it's PACKED, and that includes the drive-thru.  If you can't stand the line, there many alternatives within walking distance.Oh, and get a milkshake!

Review Text :
Looking for a place to kill a couple of hours before a Yelp event at SMG at Epicentre, we decided to pop a squat at the bar at BlackFinn for some apps and dranks.My GPS managed to navigate me directly to the EpiCentre parking deck (hooray!) where I got a prime parking spot.  Parking in the deck  - $3 per 30 min with a $20 max - so if you are there for dinner and a movie, prepare to pay $20 for parking.  Find the elevators - there are no signs that I could find on the side that I parked on to tell me that - but find the elevators, they will take you directly up to where you need to be.  After wandering around like a tourist for a bit, I walked upstairs to BlackFinn.  It was around 4:30, so I was sent to the bar downstairs, as the upstairs wasn't open yet?  Whatever... we found a spot easily at the big bar downstairs and were served by a friendly bartender who kept us drowning in drinks for 2 hours (great job!).For apps, we sampled the pretzels served with cheese sauce and the queso (more cheese) dip with tortilla chips.  The soft and warm pretzels, instead of being coated in coarse salt, were lightly sprinkled with what I think was parm cheese - good job - very good, much better than me flicking salt off all over the bar area.  The cheese dip was creamy and had a mustardy undertone to it.  The chipotle queso and chips were also very good.  They both made for great snacks to get us ready for dinner at the movies.  Friendly, efficient staff, typical uptown restaurant/bar prices, good food, workout from up and down the stairs - yay BlackFinn!

Restaurant name  Kona Grill

Review Text :
If I could give this place less than one star, I would. My family and I had the WORST experience ever in this restaurant. My friends and I frequent the Kona at Scottsdale Fashion Square and we love them! So when we were looking for dinner by our house my dad suggested we go to this Kona, I jumped at the opportunity. BIG MISTAKE. We walked into the restaurant and after a few minutes were greeted by a hostess. She said it would only be about 10 minutes, which was fine with us, so we waited. About 10 minutes later I looked around and there were several open tables, I figured the servers just needed a moment to catch up, so we continued to wait. However, 20 minutes after we were still waiting... The hostess said she would bus the table and we would be seated shortly. She started busing the table then left to talk to a gentleman, who I am assuming was the manager. After talking to him, she finished busing the table. Looking around the front room; I could see at least 5 open tables. However, we were still not taken to the table she had just finished cleaning off. After waiting for over 30 minutes she finally took us to our table, where the hostess took our drink order saying our server would be right with us. The server stopped by about 5 minutes later to say she would be right with us. Where we waited for 10 additional minutes for someone to take our order. Needless to say, after spending almost an hour being ignored and not given service we decided they did not want, not did they deserve, our business. We left $5 on the table to cover the soft drinks ordered and left. The absolute lack of organization and customer service at this location is appalling, and management needs to seriously reevaluate their practices. We will never be back.

unPhogettable is PHOnominal! Ok, bad joke aside, this is one of my new favorite Vietnamese restaurants. The food is extremely fresh and after talking with the owner, I found out that they make everything themselves from scratch with no MSG or prepackages meats. The service was excellent and the cafe setting was very inviting. Although a bit far from my house, I'll make the drive to come back here to eat again.unPHOgettable is quite PHOnomenalFor being Asian, service is remarkableGet filled up for less than ga$ in your abdominalNo MSG, no trans-fat makes it responsibleSummer rolls and pork taste so verrry nice Add some Sriracha and chili for that extra spiceOh!

I really need my .5 star for many of my reviews.  Again, we picked this restaurant partly of its name and good reviews.  The name is very catchy and I wont Phoget for a long time.  however, their Pho did not live up to its name.  It's unPhogettable but not in a good way.  The broth was a little too strong.  I think the cook added too much star anise so it was quite overwhelming.  DH ordered Bun Bo Hue.  He said it was only okay.  My friends also ordered Pho bo and they thought the same thing.  The service was excellent.  Our waitress kept asking if we needed anything else.  The owner also came over to say hi and asked about the food.  I wasn't sure if I should tell her the truth or not.  I ended up telling her that everything was great.  I should have told her what I thought of her broth and maybe she should go easy on the star anise.  Oh well... maybe next time.What do you say in this situation?Great Pho but I don't tip at this place. I found out a while ago from a few workers there that the owners take the tip from the servers. One worker went on to say that even if I tried and put the money in their apron, they would still get in trouble if they don't give it to the owners. There are cameras everywhere. I thought that was kind of sad..so I rate this place a 2 star for good pho but bad business pratice. So remember to not tip!My fave pho place in the Valley!  Not only is the food delicious but the service is top notch and the restaurant itself is beautiful (definitely not a hole in the wall!).  The walls feature murals of bamboo and pretty, artistic photos of women wearing traditional Vietnamese dresses.  The place is family-owned and on several of our visits, the owners have come and chatted at length with us--very nice people!  They WILL remember you.  Being vegetarian, I recommend the veggie pho (selection V4 on the menu), which is like a tofu/veggie explosion in a soup bowl; it has mushrooms, broccoli, cauliflower, snow peas, bok choy, cabbage, and tofu plus the bean sprouts/lime/jalapeños that come alongside.  Really fresh and good!  I also love the vegetarian egg rolls--they're unique in that they come with lettuce and pickled veggies to wrap around them--they're my favorite egg rolls I've ever had hands down!Recommend this place highly!Hands down my favorite place for Vietnamese food~Owned by a lovely family, the service here is very friendly and very personal.  Through the owner's lovely wife, I learned how to drink Vietnamese coffee properly!  You may think that's a ridiculous thing to say but it was very motherly, sweet, and completely unnecessarily.  It's the fact that she took the time out to come over and teach me all the finer details of Vietnamese coffee that made the lesson and experience memorable.  Not even my Vietnamese friends had taken the time out to teach me!  Now the food here is truly unforgettable.  I love the bun by far!  It's crisp, fresh, and always leaves me full but not uncomfortably so.  I love their egg rolls and their spring rolls and the rice dishes are always savory and flavorful.  I must admit though there is probably only *one* other place I'd rather go to get pho over this place [because they're cheaper, just as delicious, and portions are just as big], I give this place one more star than the other because they're just sooo sweet and nice here!  The service really makes that one-star difference.  The prices here are a bit higher than other Vietnamese restaurants but the quality and freshness of the ingredients makes up for it.  With the modern decor, delicious food, and great service, what's not to love?

Restaurant name  Blanco
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
Ate at Blanco last night.. very corporate and super accommodating.. we had a wonderful time which even surprised me.. stuck to the basics and thought it was the best of the Fox restaurants. Seeing that we've never had a good experience until last night says a lot. Was kind of cool seeing Sam Fox there actually quality controlling everything that was coming out of the kitchen.. though you know he was just annoying everyone, LOL!Had the short rib cheese crisp and you know what, it was actually crispy and good. Then tried the queso fundido con chorizo.. pretty darn tasty.. the cheese was slightly burnt on the bottom which I just love, wrapped in a warm flour tortilla, oh yeah! For dinner I ordered the machaca burrito.. is there such a thing as to much meat? I swear it was a whole beef roast wrapped in a tortilla.. the Mr had the green pork enchiladas.. I though those were very tasty but the sides were even tastier.. their rice is like risotto, very creamy! Helen Y was with us and she ordered the shrimp and crab civiche which I thought was extremely tasty though I would have loved it even more if it were on a toasted baguette! More like a shrimp and crab salad than a civiche though that's just me.. We ended with the tres leches cake.. this was a pretty dismal attempt at tres leches.. was so dense, chewy and sickening sweet. It was so sweet in fact it burnt my throat, pretty gross!What a great time! Blanco certainly has a fun open atmosphere and a fabulous patio with VERY comfortable seating out there.. you can order dinner up there instead of eating in the dining room which is very cool! Also, the staff was friendly and VERY attractive.. I think for me, this is the best of what Fox Concepts has to offer so far. Definite mass appeal.I am sorry, but did it say that Blanco serves Mexican food?  This is a disgrace.Lets just start by saying that my experience here was less than mediocre.  I usually find one thing wrong with a place and still give 4 stars.  This place deserves one star and 90% has to do with the food.  (The hostess was the other 10%...very unpleasant...like I was bothering her to get seated....honey that is your JOB!)I met my lovely friend Karla for lunch...she recommended the place and I have been wanting to try it.  We both ordered the chicken tortilla soup to start and I ordered also the enchiladas with green chiles.The chicken tortilla soup was a catastrophe.  It was made with chicken broth with every vegetable you can think of, chicken, and WHOLE tortillas.  The tortillas were a soggy mess and the soup was just G-d awful.  The server (who was nice) had the manager come over and take it off my bill.  (Which was nice.)  The manager even said that my soup looked very unappetizing.Next was the enchiladas...first...I didn't know that enchiladas were supposed to be HARD and CRUNCHY!!!  It was greasy, the cheese was flat out disgusting...and they even put my green chiles on the side when I did ask them to put them in the enchiladas. (Which shouldn't be too hard) And on top of everything else, my rice was BUTTERED WHITE RICE!!!!  In a Mexican style Restaurant?  Are you kidding me?  And it was so unappealing...(this meal I had to pay for...)There was no Mexican flavor or feel at all in this restaurant.  Very displeased and have no desire to ever step foot in there ever again.Like most Fox concepts, Blanco is pretty good. I'm not rushing to come back any time soon (mainly because there is so much Mexican food in much closer proximity to my house), but I would be a repeat eater. The food was pretty good - but not memorable. I really liked the chips and salsa and the guac. The veggie tacos were also very good. The chopped salad was good. The tuna tacos kind of meh. Good. And meh. So why the 4 stars? Blow jobs! Well, almost. I think.I was so impressed by the service. The hosts, waiters and managers were so attentive and friendly. Like, over-the-top friendly and giddy. Almost flirty. I'm sure if I was a dude they would have blown me or something. Next time I'm bringing a guy with me to test this theory. Anyone want to particpate in an experiment?I finally tried Blanco last Tuesday night... there were 4 in our party; not enough to make a reservation.  Luckily, when we arrived around 7:15 pm, we didn't have to wait more than 10 minutes to get seated.  And we must've lucked out, because our service was prompt and attentive.The guacamole is a perfect appetizer to share... and the chips and salsa are worth the splurge.  I shared a Caesar Salad to start, and that was quite tasty as well.  I was debating what to order for the main course and when I asked the waitress about the salmon she said she didn't eat seafood but that she's been told the salmon is 'buttery.'  Buttery salmon?  Really?  That didn't sell me on ordering the salmon, but it was what I went with after all.  And although I would not describe it as buttery, I will say it was good.  It was a generous serving as well, so I didn't mind when Jared started eating it off my plate.  The rice with veggies that it was served with was also tasty.Overall, Blanco didn't blow me away, but I am sure I'll return sometime.  You can't go wrong popping in for a drink or two and some chips, salsa, and guac in a trendy atmosphere.A lively mid-range restaurant. The crowd was mixed, but was comprised mostly of families. Strangely they played clubby music in the background. Service was really good, there were about five people servicing our table as a team. Everything came out quickly and they were able to accommodate all the bizarre dietary needs of our finicky group.The food itself was pretty basic. The big eye tuna ceviche was a significant deviation from real deal, it appeared to have small pieces of tortilla chips mixed in which through me off. The chicken fajitas were fine, but weren't a huge step up from something you could get at a chain.Final word: Ok for a casual or family dinner.Allow me to be an asshole for a moment while I write this terrible review. Maybe its because it was Monday, and raining.. maybe it was because I was in the mood for Humble Pie and not Mexican grill.. maybe its because restaurants in Arizona don't have the freshest sea food in the United States of America, whatever it was, I hated this place. I have this habit of asking my server what their favorite thing on the menu is.. and usually I go with it. I am adventurous, I like surprises.. So homegirl suggested the nachos or the Seared Ahi tacos.. so what do I do? I ordered a taco plate. Since I like variety, I mixed and matched and went with a fish & pork taco with black beans. The Ahi tasted wicked old and nasty fishy. I almost spit it out, but I am a lady and that is rude. The pork was very undercooked.. I don't know about you, but I have absolutely no interest in catching Trichinosis. I can think of better ways to spend my day than with nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, fatigue, fever, and abdominal discomfort.. sorry those are not things I am interested in, thanks anyway though. Beans were served cold and I swear the rice they served was something out a box from the dollar store. My dog could make better rice than that. There was shit floating in my water and the limes I asked for were so dried out that not one drop of juice came out. Seriously? Cut up some fresh ones.. its the little things that count. Service was slow, but the chick was nice enough. One of the girls I went with knew one of the managers, who was supposed to hook us up with an employee discount, but conveniently forgot about us at the end.. but what are you gonna do, nothing is free anymore. I dunno, I just wasn't impressed. The only thing I dug about this joint were the tiles on the wall.. and im certainly not going to return to a place to stare at a wall. next!Lovely restaurant in the Borgata, typical trendy decor that the Fox restaurants have going for them.  My girlfriend and I met up for margs and lunch on a Saturday, it was busy but we were able to get a table right away.  Our server was slow and not very friendly.  I had the cucumber and kumquat margarita with shrimp tacos.  The margarita was far better than the tacos - they were just normal shrimp tacos.  My friend got a cheese crisp which looked amazing and I would highly recommend that dish to anyone.I've been a customer of Blanco's for quite a while now. It's a go-to place for girl's night or a quick bite with my hubby. Unfortunately, Blanco has lost both my husband and I as patrons.On a recent Saturday night, we were craving a delicious cheese crisp and pitcher of sangria. After we had learned our lesson on weekends past, my husband called ahead for seating and we were informed it would be 45 minutes. No big deal and nothing we didn't expect. An hour after our call in time, and waiting in the restaurant for 30 minutes, I approached the hostess asking where we were on the list. She informed me it would be just a bit longer and they were working to get us a table. Half an hour after that, no table. I politely approached again and it was clear that we had been skipped, marked off the list and forgotten. The hostess stated the next table would be ours and to give them just a few more minutes. When I went to sit back down, the couple sitting next to us were seated. Infuriated, we both decided it was time to leave. My husband gave our pager back and the hostesses stood there like deer in the headlights. They said sorry but made no attempt to make the situation right. I find this type of thing to be completely unacceptable. We were patient, understood there would be a wait and still chose to spend our date night at this restaurant. In return we were greeted with lousy customer service and no table. On the plus side, we discovered a new restaurant right across the way we have been to multiple times now. Thanks for the help, Blanco!

Still consistent and still decent, but I would say that I've experienced better. If you have a formula that works, stick to it. Since I started stopping by Dragon, the layout of the restaurant and the steam tables haven't changed. And more importantly, the food items haven't changed. They still offer a Black Pepper Pork and there are Barbecue Spare Ribs at dinner and the steamed dimsum and fried dumplings are there all day. Chicken & Broccoli and Lo Mein and such, too.They've had a few platters of sushi - nothing more than California Rolls - occasionally.With all of that said, there's a new player in town. Not even a mile further south is Jasmine Buffet which has more tables, better sushi and a cook-to-order hibachi grill with fresh veggies. Though it is a little more expensive there.

Don't expect anything fancy, it's a real hole in the wall. This place has been in business since the early 70s and I understand why. Food : amazing. I absolutely love it. Their specialty is fish n chips and you can taste the Scottish authenticity. I hadn't gone in over 5 years, yet I did not taste any difference.Decor : reality is, there is none. Some posters of Scotland, but that's it. Note : they are located on the waterfront. I always go pick up my food and eat on the beautiful and scenic view of the waterfront. I suggest you do the same.

Review Text :
One of my favorite places for ribs. First one I went to was in Greenville and we had our rehearsal dinner at the one in Charleston. ;-)Cost to worth it ratio: 3Eve award: Best baby back ribsHighlights:- Ribs: Meaty but tender; large but no major gnawing needed- Sauces: A variety of your choice for your ribs. Pick from carolina sweet, tennessee whiskey, memphis style wet, memphis style dry, carolina mustard, or habañero hot .-- Carolina sweet: my fave sauce. Basic tomato based one but with more sweetness to it like I like it--Tennesee whiskey: my second fave--has a bit of a whiskey kick- Sides: it defaults as cole slaw and beans but you can pick any 2. Other options are cinnamon baked apples, southern style rice, green beans, baked potato, macaroni & cheese, seasoned fries, or potato salad.-- Mac and cheese: I was craving this and it hit the spot. Cheesy but not too gooey and soft but not mushy noodles.-- Specials: they had broccoli casserole and sweet potato crunch. Love them both. Broccoli was almost blended with the cheese like a filling and very cheesy. Mashed sweet potatoes with brown sugar and nuts went well with the ribs but doubled as a dessert. :-)- Napkins: no measly white paper things here--they give you a green towel. ;-)- Lunch specials: they have a small portion of ribs as well as a few ribs and a bbq sandwich with sides- Location: driving distance from the hub's parents so a dining option I know I'll enjoyLowlights (my flip side to highlights):- MSG: I noticed most of the sauces included this and I prefer sauces that don't include this.- Pecan pie: I love pecan pie but never get to it here cause I fill up on ribsI'll be back to Sticky Fingers next time I get a chance.This place was something of a disappointment. Our server was amicable, but the wait time for the food was long, especially given that the establishment was half empty. When my pulled pork sandwich finally did arrive, the meat was bone dry and underseasoned. Fortunately, making liberal use of the array of BBQ sauces was enough to make it palatable. My companion's brisket sliders were a notch better but still nothing special, as were our sides (mac n cheese and sweet potato casserole). Eight dollars for a sandwich, side, and a drink is a fairly decent value these days, and Sticky Fingers has the right ambiance for the food it serves. However, the kitchen needs to get its act together.We were back in the Concord area and decided to give Sticky Fingers another try. To the establishment's credit, several of the problems (dried-out BBQ and slow service) we experienced during our initial visit did not recur. That and moderated expectations made for a much more enjoyable meal.Sticky Fingers was out of brisket when we visited, so my companion and I opted for a sausage/BBQ combo plate and an order of BBQ tacos, respectively. First, the good: all of the meats were moist, and the sausage had both a wonderful smoky aroma and a savory black pepper kick. The seasoned fries were also above-average. Now the bad: neither the pulled pork nor the pulled chicken had any discernable seasoning. Generous application of the house sauces (there are several, ranging from smoky to hot to sweet) and taco fixings remedied this, but one would expect smokehouse meats to be imbued with more flavor.Service was both friendly and prompt during this visit. While the $8 lunch specials weren't being offered, the $9 to $10.50 blue plate specials came in generous enough portions to justify the pricing. The brick-and-pipe decor remains a good fit for the cuisine, and there was plenty of seating.Upon re-evaluation, Sticky Fingers gets enough right (value, selection, sauces) to make it a decent lunch option, but the underseasoned BBQ continues to hold it back.

Restaurant name  Le Roi du Smoked Meat

Review Text :
They claim to have the best smoked meat in Montreal. Is that the case? After eating a metric ton of meat and sugar at Cabane à Sucre Au Pied de Cochon hours before, apparently it seemed like a good idea to eat a giant smoked meat sandwich before bed. I wasn't mad at it. Being a huge fan of pastrami, it was pretty similar to what you'll find at places like Katz's and 2nd Avenue Deli in New York City. A little less fatty, but a nice flavor and stacked quite high. Served to you in a diner atmosphere by women that probably went to elementary school with your grandma, it makes for a fun experience.As others have pointed out, skip the poutine.

Review Text :
Ok, let's be honest. You never go to Verdun. You don't want to, and probably never will. But after spending a couple years in Montreal, you may develop a passionate love for poutines. Not the kind of drunken one-night stand love, but one of slow savoring of flavors. That's when you start searching for the perfect match.If I were on a Poutine dating show, no doubt Poutine Lafleur's poutine would in my final two. Fresh fries, fresh curds. Both fulfill the basic requirements. But the sauce. It's rich and peppery. A thick chicken gravy, not too saucy. Your fries won't get mushy. And it gets served in the classic container, none of that pretentious thing called a plate.If you're serious about finding the best poutine in the city, give this poutine a try (and Maam Bolduc's too, while you're at it) and forget about la banquise, la belle province or Patati Patata. And did I say it's cheap? $4 with taxes for the one pictured above.edit: This place is NOT to be confused with Lafleur the hotdog chain. It's a local thing, and the real deal.

Review Text :
When I was young my parents used to tell me that we would all meet up again in Heaven. At the time it seemed pleasant and relieving to think that I could just do my own thing now and catch up with everyone after we were all nuked to death in the zombie apocalypse.And then it dawned on me that Heaven might not be my scene. I imagined an afterlife where I was forced to spend all of eternity with all the gun-toting, bible-beating homo/xenophobes I spent my whole life antagonizing. Them looking all fucking smug and happy, Peaches Christ it makes me want to throw a shark at a mailman.So I have since decided that I will do whatever it takes to get into Hell. With all the drinking and sexing and, you know, changing my gender and all, I'm sure eventually I'll check off enough boxes to get me a backstage pass to Damnation. I occasionally burn down a village and smash a goblin's head in with a rock just in case I can get into Valhalla. Yeah.So Ci Ci's Pizza.Just like that.It sounds like heaven. A pizza buffet under 7 dollars. As much pizza, soup, salad, and dessert you could ever gorge yourself on. Every variety of pizza you could imagine. Fettuccine and spinach pizza. Taco pizza. Hawaiian pizza. Macaroni and cheese pizza. BBQ chicken pizza. And like the meal dispensing machines from "Red Dwarf", the kitchen is infinitely flexible. Want a flavor of pizza not currently available on the buffet line? They'll special make it. Just. For. You. They'll even send out one of their underpaid lackeys to bring it out to you on a tray, like a secret waiter without dignity who won't expect a tip.Ahh yes. It's a venerable heaven for a pizza lover.Until you realize it's everybody else's heaven. Everybody else you hate.Parents who bring their five kids because Little Timmy hasn't developed table manners yet and would just embarrass them at a real restaurant. The unreasonably picky eater who keeps taking one slice of each pizza on the line, taking the smallest of bites, and deciding its too salty too cheesy too saucy for his tastes and throws it away, forcing you and the staff to watch at least three whole pizzas thrown away before he finds a flavor he likes.The family that wisely figures that since Grandma has a hard enough time walking to Red Lobster, they might as well bring her somewhere she'll have to give her legs some exercise just to get some salad.All the underpaid, bitter and apathetic high schoolers who all lost their jobs at Harkins when they showed up for work with their name tag missing...THE THIRD TIME THIS MONTH!It's a shame Ci Ci's has such a suck infestation. Because they'll probably be shut down by the health inspector before anyone realizes that they aren't just pizza makers; they're wizards. No, alchemists.Only an alchemist schooled by The Beast himself would be able to take a lump of dough and make it into breadsticks, pizza, cheese bread, cinnamon rolls, and apple pie.This isn't just a cutesy metaphor. It's seriously the same dough. Fun Fact: The first time I came here I was approached by a manager and offered a job, not based on my experience in the food industry or my impeccable customer service, but because I had a quirky t-shirt on. "You have the sense of humor needed for this."Funny. I imagine Peter saying the same thing to me once I get to the front desk at the Pearly Gates.For the love of trolls, Odin. Give me a sign already.

Review Text :
Pita Pit is hands down the best final stop on any downtown Charlotte drinking tour.The line is long, but the staff is very experienced at keeping it moving.  Also, you will seldom find a more drunkenly amiable line to stand in.  I made more friends in the Pita Pit line than I made at the last Yelp event.The food is...well...to tell you the truth I can never remember.  However, judging by the clothes I wore the night before, it can be a bit messy.Definitely go here before passing out on your next night of revelry, your hangover will thank you.The people who work the late shift here deserve a medal. Or holiday. Or the biggest hug ever. Seriously, how would you feel if you were at work and an army of blackout drunk people stormed into your office? They deal with it every Friday and Saturday night.I'll be honest... I'm usually not sober when I end up here. I'll make fun of the other drunk people and act like I'm completely fine. I dunno if anyone buys it.My go-to order is the buffalo chicken loaded with some type of combination of mushrooms, jalapenos, banana peppers, insert whatever veggie I'm feeling and a bunch of tzatziki. I usually take it to go so I can eat it at home in pajamas. However, if you can snag a seat sit and stay for the show of the endless parade of the inebriated.I have to give props to the workers here. They handle it all in stride and are pretty good sports about everything. Don't be discouraged by a long line. Pita Pit can pump orders pretty quickly so they wait is never all that long. If you want to avoid the madness, make sure you get here before 2am to get there before the rush.

Review Text :
Wow..!I mean wow! How can you get so much food for only $15.95?Take the gluttony of a buffet and its various entrees, ranging from fried rice and quasi-sushi rolls and smash it together with a Korean BBQ-grill-at-your-table and you get something that's purely American with an Asian twist. Not so great for vegetarians or those trying to reduce their meat intake but I digress. They have an entire row of raw meat; marinated beef and pork, unmarinated beef and pork, chicken, shrimp, squid, etc. So choose what your heart desires because it will stop functioning after one session here.. a last meal, if you will.Enough snark...For the uninitiated:The marinated beef and ribs are slightly sweet yet yield slightly different tastes.The marinated pork and squid are slightly spicy.The unmarinated slices of beef and pork are meant to be eaten with the lettuce.. like a lettuce wrap; you can season accordingly with the various sauces available at the counter. My personal favorite is to mix the salt and pepper with sesame oil as a dipping sauce.If you feel so inclined you can try the tripe.. I didn't.Thanks to Naurry K.'s ROTD and other yelpers that I got to witness the madness of woo-che asian grill buffet.This place is packed, and I do mean a steady stream of customers on a Wednesday night.  Make reservations, especially if your party is more than four!  (And like others have said, their largest table does only accommodate 6 people, so your group will have to be split up if it's bigger!)They have a decent amount of food to choose from with the main focus of the food being Korean.  Soups:Miso soup, Seaweed soup, Korean Tofu soup (which was pretty good, like Eve Michelle C. also mentioned)Tons of marinated meats - beef, pork, chickenMarinated seafood - squid, shrimpOther Korean goodies you usually get as banchan: potato salad-like thing, vinegary clear weird texture noodle thing, creamy version with the weird texture noodle thing (but pretty good!), bean sprouts, kim chee, etc.Cooked foods like baked mussels (with mayo topping), pike(?) fish (that had a salty outside but really good), crab, shrimp, gyozas, veggies, etc.They also have soba noodles, chop chae, purple rice, raw crab (Korean style), lettuce for wrapping your meats, dipping sauces including the sesame oil and salt concoction, etc.And if you must, they have sushi too!  Desserts include fresh fruit (cantaloupe), jello, and shikhye (which I was pretty excited about since I rarely get it anymore at other Korean restaurants).  And plus, vanilla and chocolate ice cream too!Service was good, depending on who you got.   Our waitress was great about refilling our soda and tea (which is included), clearing plates, and they also changed out our grill mid-way 'cuz it was getting so grubby! Overall, you really can't beat the price for the amount of food and selection available.  And yes, keep in mind your clothes, jackets, and purse will stink really bad afterward.  And like Jason L. said, it gets cold in there, especially if you're sitting in the back.  So bring a jacket you don't mind stinking up in there with you!Lunch (M-F 11 am to 3 pm) $12.99/ppDinner (M-Sun 3 pm to 10 pm) $15.99/ppSat/Sun/Holidays (All Day) $15.99/ppThey also have a discounted child price too.**Summary**       - Marinade - All the meats that have marination are well marinated.       - Value - Even though they raised their prices to $18.99 for dinner, they're still below Sura ($22.95) and Honey Pig ($19.99). Plus, they don't restrict what you can get unlike Honey Pig's one short rib order limitation.       - Decor - The place doesn't look as great with their portable A/C units lying around.       - Grill - Don't forget that you can always ask for a new grill when you've burnt yours up.**Price**       - $12.99 Lunch AYCE 11am-3pm Mon-Fri       - $18.99 Dinner/Weekend AYCE 3pm-Midnight Mon-Fri, Sat & Sun**Available**       - Beef Galbi(Short Ribs) (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/07gh-AImcEcWQ2bew-jprg?select=8ps50HLC6pTQ5rJ7rEfkng)       - Bulgogi (Marinated Beef)       - Deungshim Gui (Sirloin)       - Chadol Baki (Thinly Sliced Brisket) (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/07gh-AImcEcWQ2bew-jprg?select=nI_1i_NOfAd0PwpGCPK5vA)       - Pork Galbi (Pork Ribs) (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/07gh-AImcEcWQ2bew-jprg?select=gCmu20le5ieLGe5v3dZhAw)       - Samgyeopsal (Unsalted Bacon AKA Pork Belly)       - Spicy Pork Bulgogi (Marinated Pork)       - Decent size assortment of hot foods (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/07gh-AImcEcWQ2bew-jprg?select=BRiOubp6yE79ZSlkmUJuGQ)**Recommendations**       - After trying all the other AYCE Korean BBQ places in town, I definitely favor Woo Che over the others. They're cheaper and their meat has more flavor.

Review Text :
Last night, my friend and I were looking for a casual place for a drink so we headed to Kafein on Bishop. I was not aware that this café by day turns to a bar by night. As I entered the bar, I was immediately taken by the cosy, home-like vibe. The décor was lovely. With its Red walls, the lights dimmed, and red velvet chairs, Kafein is made attractive and welcoming. I ordered a Mojito. Served in a mason jar for 10$, I was satisfied with my choice. I would recommend this place for a date. Though the music became increasingly louder as the night progressed, Kafein maintains a romantic atmosphere, which in turn makes you at ease and relaxed.

Review Text :
So now that I live on the East Side, I've come to really appreciate and enjoy Alchemy. Yes, it's small, and yes, there's almost always a wait for a table. Yes, they only take cash, but hey, there's an ATM that only charges a $1 fee.Despite those very minor inconveniences, the place is a true gem. Nothing beats sitting at the bar, enjoying one of the awesome taps they always have available (or a classic cocktail, or a very reasonable bottle of vino), with a plate of grilled bread (which comes with a spread/dip that changes regularly), and then splitting an entree with a friend.I've yet to have something that isn't delicious; from salads to fish frys to the bella burger - it's all superb. Service has been consistently good, and the vibe/feel of the place is so welcoming.Go. You won't regret it.I feel right at home when the first thing asked of me upon sitting down at a table is, "Bloody Mary's?" On a Sunday morning recovery lunch excursion, our server didn't have to ask us twice. Their Bloodies have the perfect amount of spice and flavor - definitely a fan.For food, I opted most recently for the BLFT, which OMFG, why have I not been requesting my tomatoes to be fried in a beer batter for every sandwich I've ever eaten? I went with a cous cous salad with pumpkin and walnuts for my side since it was the special for the day. It's all about balance, my friends. My companion hammered through the Tinshack Smokehouse Burger with fries and after taking a bite of the burger, I almost went hobbit on that lunch and devoured both our meals. I think I'm still finding green peppercorn aioli under my nails. Yum. Ew.Warm ambiance and a casual setting with anything but casual food. The only downside is they only take cash but the fee for the ATM isn't too lucrative. Get at it.I love this place, so comfortable and "real."The hubs and I had the special burger tonight made with Black Earth beef, portobello mushroom, spinach, Swiss cheese and onions carmelized in the Ommegang Glimmerglass beer. Are you kidding me? Who thinks of these combinations? It was SO good!Paul had their "chips" which are their house fries, and I upgraded to the sweet potato fries. I figure I might as well go all the way if I'm going to eat a burger.My husband loves the rotating beer taps and watches their Facebook page for updates. They go through the specials quickly, so stop in within 24 hours of them posting a special beer if you want to be sure  they have a pint for you.They also make a great brandy old fashioned and a hopquila margarita with lemongrass ginger kombucha! Again, so creative!

Review Text :
I literally just had lunch at Fiore Bistro. Well, I was not in an actual bistro, but the meal certainly made me forget I was eating in a food court. Though, I have been to this place many times before, their food has not ceased to satisfy my hunger and I. The concept is great. Bistro food served quickly, yet taste and quality remain high. This afternoon, I ordered the grilled chicken with nicely seasoned potatoes and grilled vegetables. All meals include salad or soup and portions are big compared to the average meal size at a food court. My only problem with this place is the price. My meal cost me almost 23$ taxes included. Perhaps my hunger made me forget to check the prices beforehand, though I was not expecting the meal to cost more than 15$. I find this to be WAY too expensive for a bistro in a food court. Yes, the quality is greatly above food court average, however paying 23$ for my meal made me feel foolish. But aside from the price, to reiterate, the food is great. They have other options such as pastas, fish, and steak; some equally expensive others more affordable.

Review Text :
Pizza A Metro in CenPho is branching out! For those of you on the East side, you will pleased to know that they are ramping up their new location in the next few weeks with some invite only soft-launches. If you want to be included, stop by the Thomas location and give them your contact info...  The hard launch is scheduled for October 1, 2008.I sat down with Maurizio today during lunch and got some of the particulars to whet your appetites -- The new location is larger, much larger. They will have a wine room, a bar that will seat approximately 25, and the dining room with seating for 80+.Some of your favorites will appear on their menu, but Amarone will include a lot of new items which are more in line with the larger kitchen and the more upscale flavor of the new site.Amarone will be open from 11:00 to Midnight.For anyone that hasn't had the pleasure of meeting or dining with Maurizio, you are in for a treat. This man LOVES food and experiences obvious pleasure from sharing it with others!East-siders, mark your calenders and get ready for Amarone!I think grand is a word I'll be using over and over to describe the decor of Amarone.  It looks nothing remotely like Pizza a Metro.  From the gates through which you enter the restaurant, to the enormous round marble bar which has lights shining up through it, to the giant chandeliers, it seems that the recession has not hit this part of Scottsdale.  The grandeur seems out of place in this tired strip mall with its bowling alley and assortment of small businesses.  But once you're inside, you feel like you're in a different world - somewhere between a restaurant in NYC's Little Italy and a swanky hotel bar.  Maurizio and his friendly team were gracious enough to seat us even though we arrived past 10pm on a weeknight (kitchen closes at 10pm).  The fresh out-of-the-oven pita-like bread that Metro is so known for hit our table first with a side of caramelized onions and other aromatics.  We really liked the light coating of olive oil and salt on the warm thin bread.  Then came our order:Stuffed Mushrooms $10 - shrooms stuffed with sausage, ricotta, parmesan in a lemon garlic veal stock reduction:  lots of flavor although the stuffing tasted a bit too much like liver for one of usShrimp Scampi $11- half dozen large butterflied shrimp in a lemon butter white wine sauce:  the shrimp were huge but unfortunately lacked flavor Homemade Gnocchi  $14 - in a tomato sauce with cubes of mozz and basil: the light and airy gnocchi was definitely our faveI found the sauces on my two apps a bit unbalanced and the plating old-fashioned.  It seems that the dishes that Metro are known for are still the stars here.  Given how large the menu is, I really need to come back and try a few of the 16 pastas ($14-$23) and 17 mains ($18-$28) before I can give a real verdict.  Get the word out: Amarone is open for business!

Review Text :
Pho Lien is the best Vietnamese Beef Noodle (Pho Bo) restaurant in Montreal. Don't take my word for it, that is from the Vietnamese locals who know food. The owner used to run a factory locally, but when those opportunities went to China for cheaper costs, he had to shut down the Factory and try something different. So he went and hired the best Pho cook he could find, employed him for a year, and learned how to make good Pho. It isn't to California standards, but here in Montreal, C'est Magnifique!

This little place just opened in a strip mall and you'd probably miss it if you didn't know it was there. Fortunately, I knew thanks to a well-timed coupon arriving in the mail.The Cajun-inspired fried chicken is juicy with a crispy skin and just-right flavorings. I had coleslaw and mashed potatoes with gravy for sides and they were great. The gravy had just the right kick and the coleslaw was among the best I've ever tasted.They also carry fried shrimp which I'll be back to try and they have many other sides including fried okra for those with the stomach for such things.Friendly, helpful, and quick counter service in this to-go-only restaurant. It's small, but it has a big heart. It's part of a chain of restaurants, but this is the only one in Arizona so far. Here's hoping it's not the last!I will run on the treadmill for an hour to indulge in the deliciousness that is Louisiana Fried Chicken. The fried chicken is moist and spicy, I paired it with fried okra and mashed potatoes and gravy. It was probably a 2500 calorie meal and I loved every single bite.

First impression.  Totally ooh la la romantical inside.  I felt like I was meeting a french lover and we would sit closely and feed each other croissants.  ,I was, in fact, not meeting my french lover, but some fab yelpers for a new dining experience.  They did not feed me anything, but I did enjoy some good food and great company!Being good little foodies, we had researched the menu (thanks Serena!) and decided to go with the food pairing.  Our waiter was little to no help in actually describing any of the menu items we would receive or up selling the extra $20 wine pairing.  Strike one.We decided to not do the wine tasting and just choose 2 half glasses.  It was really interesting how they break down the wine servings.  You can buy a 2oz, 4oz, 8oz and bottle.  I actually like that because it encourages you to try different wines you may not be familiar with.  Or be too scared to try and not like for fear of blowing $10 a glass!  Strike two came as we sat there for a good 20 minutes after our food was ordered waiting for our waiter to come back and ask us what our wine selection would be (hint to business: people who drink spend more money, so hurry it up:).  We actually had NO clue what kind of food we would receive for the tasting.  Not a good choice for a picky eater.  I applaud those who aren't (and get annoyed at those who are, sorry folks!).  The first course came and it looked as if two people received one dish and two people received another.  I had the angel hair crab pasta.  It was an interesting dish to start with but it was a strong start food wise because the white cream sauce was really tasty.  The next dish was trout with greens, or it at least looked like that.  I could barely understand the food runner as he literally, ran away.  It was OK.  Nothing memorable...literally because it's the one dish I struggled to remember as I thought back at the four dishes.  Third dish was the spinach salad with goat cheese and blueberry vinaigrette dressing.  I love when restaurants have interesting salad choices.  A simple salad is just that, simple.  You can add flavor, literally, to any salad with an array of toppings and dressings.  I really enjoyed the uniqueness of this one.  My last dish was quail with risotto and spinach.  Greens were obviously in high quantity in the kitchen tonight!  I actually thought this was the best dish.  It surprised me because I'm usually not a fan of "chicken" dishes.  It was really tender and flavorful with a ginger reduction sauce.  I also liked the risotto and spinach mix.  The sauce made it really rich and flavorful as well.Where's strike three you ask?  Well, we waited FOREVER for everything!  Water, wine, meals....Bueller....Bueller??  The saving grace was that someone (server, food runner, manager, busboy...no clue) came out and apologized for the slow service and told us desserts would be on the house.  If you know me, you know a desert can fill a lot of voids in my life.  Maybe even bad service.  We received a peanut butter ice cream sandwich (YUM!), balsamic ice cream (DOUBLE YUM, surprisingly), rhubarb pie (Ew, too tart) and lemon pie (Ew, too sweet).  The only one on the table left almost in tact was the rhubarb pie.  Tasting menu's are usually the way to go when you're at a new restaurant and want to sample a bunch of different items.  I almost feel like I may have been better off choosing one item (mac n cheese, I'm looking at you!).  So yes, I'll be back.  Soon?  Not so sure.  And I'll for sure be a one meal kinda woman.  French lover style.I visited Toast for a date with CM on Tues. evening at around 8pm.  He wanted to do something low-key, and I wanted to get drinks, so Toast fit the bill for a compromise as a low-key bar.Sure enough, when we arrived, it wasn't busy at all, and was pleasantly cozy and quiet. To ensure that we'd get a table, I'd made a reservation, so our waitress seated us at one of the tables in the back area under the painting of a city skyline. There was music playing from a speaker above the table, but it wasn't too loud, and was quite an interesting mix of older and more contemporary tunes, adding to the mood.Given that the Tues. special is $6 cocktails, I assumed that it referred to all of the cocktails on the menu, so I mentioned the special to our waitress.  She clarified that the $6 cocktails are special and off menu, however, and vary by the week.  This week, our choices were a cocktail called a ragtime, which tasted reminiscent of root beer, which I ordered, and a Prosecco cocktail, which CM ordered.  Both of the cocktails were nicely balanced, with mine being on the sweeter side (though not overly so), and we both enjoyed them very much.  In addition to the cocktail, I also ordered a glass of the Riesling ice wine, since I enjoy Riesling, and I'd heard of ice wine, but had never tried it before.  If you are looking for a good dessert wine or enjoy sweeter wine, I'd definitely recommend it, though it's on the pricier side for $10/glass.  Unfortunately, I ended up spilling some of it by knocking the glass over when gesturing.  :-(In addition to our drinks, we ordered the cheese board to share ($12), which came with the following cheeses (as explained by our waitress): Goat cheese, blue cheese, camembert, manchego, and sharp cheddar.  Additionally, it came with some apple butter and a few toasted bread strips (see photo).  All of these components were quite tasty, with my favorites being the goat cheese and camembert. I only wish they would provide more bread sticks or crackers with the cheese plate--though our waitress was happy to provide us with some more upon request.Overall, I was quite pleased with our experience at Toast.  In contrast to others' experiences, our service from our waitress (didn't get her name) was attentive and helpful.  To be honest, given the mixed reviews in combination with the cost of entrees, I doubt I'd have a full meal at Toast (except for with a discount, perhaps). However, it's definitely a great spot to have a few drinks in a cozy, intimate, and relaxed setting with some good friends or a date! 4.5 stars.

Review Text :
How anyone had a good enough experience here to leave anything but a scathing review is an absolute mystery to me.Such a shame, and a waste of a great location and nice building - I want to like this place, I really want to, and I tried to SO HARD. This place was great when it was a Midtown Sundries, and I had high hopes when they dressed the place up when it sold and became Bull and Barrister, but it's been a steady decline in every way imaginable over the past couple of years. The only thing worse than the food the last few times I was there was the service, and I *used* to enjoy the atmosphere, but I have a hard time enjoying anything when everything (EVERYTHING) I touch is sticky (the floor, the tables, my seat (wtf?)...)This place got more chances to get their act together than most because they're less than a mile from my house. Often times we'd say "well, it sucks but it's close by...maybe this time they'll surprise us?" Yeah, we were in denial.First off, you'll likely wait quite a while to be seated, and then you'll spend the majority of your dining experience waiting on your server to grace you with their presence. It isn't that they're busy - far from it - it's just that the hosts/hostesses are busy dicking around in the kitchen with the line cooks and the waitresses are far too busy texting their bfs and bffs on their cell phones to acknowledge your existence.I can even forgive crap service for decent food at a convenient location, but everything I ordered during my last handful of visits -aside from the sweet potato fries - sucked hardcore: southwestern taco salad, barrister club, nachos, chicken fingers...I tried simpler and simpler things to make (how do you screw up something you just toss in a fryer?) but to no avail, it was all pretty repulsive.The very last thing I ordered there was a black and bleu burger. I had a vague thought after I ordered: "hmm...our waitress did not ask me how I wanted that cooked, oh well, I'll deal with a well done burger..." When it arrived I realized that they used those frozen 1/2 inch beef patties that are too think to cook any way but well done. It was also suffocated in overly salty shake spices and charred to resemble a little black hockey puck, except I think a hockey puck may have been a little more savory and moist. I hate HATE sending food back, it's maybe once every 5 years that I do, but this was just inedible. When our waitress finally stopped by about 20 MINUTES after dumping off our 'food' I tried to politely point out my problem and asked if I could just get some chicken fingers instead hoping those would be safe and she said with a look of utter confusion "sooo....you want two dinners?" uhm, what? no. I'd really prefer to eat dinner just once, and I'd prefer it be digestible. What is wrong with you? I ended up just asking for the chicken fingers to go and she took my sick sad burger to the garbage, but sure enough, when the bill came, I was charged for both a burger and chicken fingers. I just paid it so I could get out of there as soon as possible and never return. Every time I pass this place (daily, damn it) I wonder how it is still in business and say a little prayer that maybe tomorrow will be the day the sign gets taken down and we have something halfway decent down the street from us. The only thing I'd find this establishment good for at this time is a bottled beer. And the only time I'd go there for it is if I was in the mood for it to be warm by the time it made it to my table 20 minutes after I ordered it. Just sayin.

Restaurant name  Fogo de Chão Brazilian Steakhouse
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
Havent been to a Brazilian-style steakhouse since in Puerto Vallarte this past summer. While the meat was better in PV the salad bar at Fogo is a low carbin' dream! We're talking fresh mozzarella, mushrooms, Parmigiano-Reggiano (a whole wheel), manchego cheese, prosciutto.. delicious and satisfying all this and more for only 19.50! Now if you want to have endless rounds with the Gaucho's you'll have to pony up $42.50 (including unlimited salad bar), a real bargain if you ask me, great quality. The meat just keeps coming and coming.. highlights were the leg of lamb, garlic beef and the sausage. They also bring a basket of bread (they forgot ours) as well as fried bananas, mashed potatoes and fried polenta.. be sure to skip that stuff and stick to the meats and salad bar. Oh, avoid the pork ribs.. while the Mr liked his, mine tasted like they were in someones ass for a while.. pretty nast though I think was the bones. Now if the only the Gaucho's were shirtless or wearing ass less chaps.. well one would hope.What an amazing event! Fabulous food, wonderful service, cool atmosphere and terrific company set off a spectacular evening. 12 hours after it has finished and I am still full. Fogo De Chao offers remarkable service that is extremely attentive leaving customers wanting for nothing. One of the staff even took us in small groups to tour the kitchen and see how the various meats are cooked to perfection.Gabi - thank you so much for organizing this event.As I sit here, consumed with a meat based hangover, I have fond memories of last evening.  The service, the food, the crowd all fabulous.I can't thank them enough, for a graduate student who has had dreams of reaching meat nirvana, this was an excellent opportunity.What a great way to get introduced to Fogo De ChaoAnd I thought I would still be full this morning because of all the wonderful food I consumed last night.  (Sorry meal plan, but I had to break a couple rules last night...)  Food, service, atmosphere were all A+!!!!  The meat was cooked to perfection.  The salad bar is AMAZING!!!  And the tour of the kitchen and the private room was a great touch to end the evening.Thank you Gabi for putting this together!  It was such an excellent treat!A meat feast!  Woo hoo!I am STILL full. The staff was great. Everything was delicious. I really can't pick a favorite. I wish I would have been able to have more of what was offered at the salad bar, but I wanted to save as much room as possible for all the meat. And there was plenty of it. Thank you Rolando for taking us on a tour of the kitchen. This was so neat. I think he said all but 2 of the cooks were Brazilian.And thank you Gabi for putting this together. We had an amazing time.  :)Too many restaurants, too little room in my pants.  Although on my list, Fogo De Chao had taken a back seat to other less deserving establishments it seems.  Not forgotten, just cast aside for the time being.  I hang my head in shame at that now.I could not resist the abundance of tempting offerings at the salad bar.  Since I could not possibly try everything and still eat meat, I opted to sacrifice everything green.  I filled my plate with cheeses, smoked salmon, prosciutto, roasted veggies, and everything not in the leafy green category.  At the table, I could also not resist the fried polenta and fried bananas.  And those little popovers!  Since they were small, I didn't count how many I consumed.   Leaving little room for the meat attraction, what I did sample was tender and flavorful.Big thanks to Gabi and the wonderful staff in the front and in the kitchen who made sure we were taken care of from start to finish.  Once I recover, I'll be back for more!Filet, Sirloin, and Ribeye, oh my!This was my first Fogo De Chao experience, and it exceeded my expectations!  I've been to other Brazilian steakhouses in the past, but Fogo was fabulous!  Sure, I could've made a meal on the sensational thirty item salad bar on it's own, but I took a breather and then went for the meat.  Green light on!  I also enjoyed the crispy hot polenta and caramelized banana side dishes. Yum!Rolando was the waiter I had the most contact with and he was remarkable.  Evan, the GM, was friendly as well... this was such a treat to be a part of, and of course, even more fun because I was surrounded by some of my favorite yelpers!Thanks Fogo folks - once I digest my 2 - 3 lbs of meat, I'll be back to see you again!I've had two experiences at Fogo.  One with a very large party and one with a party of four.  Both the service and food were consistent.  For anyone new to Fogo, it's a fixed price (about $45) for salad bar and all you can eat meat (beef, pork, chicken, lamb).  Start with salad bar (save room) and flip your little card to green when you're ready for meat.  A parade of servers will offer their wares, say yeah or neah and wait for the next.  Flip card to red when you don't need service.Salad bar is fantastic.  I can't resist the smoked salmon, mozzarella balls, and apple salad.  In fact, on my second trip, I loaded up so much from the salad bar, I skipped the meat entirely.  I'm also particularly fond of the polenta and bread (which is more like a popover).  Based on my first experience, some of the meat offerings are better than others.  But since you can have as much or as little of anything as you would like, try everything.  I can also recommend the papaya cream for dessert.  Don't worry you won't have room.  It's light enough that you can make room.As far as service, it is excellent.  As soon as you flip that card to green, servers are there.  The only complaint on both visits is that they do ask if they can bring you a particular cut of meat, and then they don't follow through anyway.  It's not like you'll go hungry, but it can be a little annoying.This is meat nirvana, and the best Brazilian-style steakhouse I have visited.I started with a Brazilian beer in the bar, then met up with several friends for dinner here on Saturday night. We all had a great time trying the 15 different cuts of meat, the unusual salad bar, and the sides of potatoes and plantains (which are all included for under $50). My personal favourites were the filet, ribeye, and the "house beef".What's that you say? A VEGAN going to a Brazilian Steakhouse? How can this be? Two Words: SALAD BAR! Set in a Fine Dining Atmosphere Fogo De Chao offers a Pristine Salad Bar fit for a Vegan Queen. Choices like Brazilian Hearts of Palm, Whole Shitake Mushrooms, Jumbo Asparagus, Whole Artichoke Hearts, Sun Dried Tomatoes, Butter Lettuce and the list goes on and on. Some of the traditional side dishes are also vegan safe like the fried bananas and also the fried polenta with no cheese. Both are very delicious! Trust me you wont leave hungry. I've been twice now and would gladly dine here again anytime!P.S.  The staff was incredible, our service was flawless and, we were completely taken care of every second of our visit.Valentine's Day and what can be better than a wonderful night out with my beautiful wife!  We booked reservations at Fogo de Chao and were looking forward to a wonderful evening.  We arrive promptly for our reservation and were warmly greeted by a 20 minute wait standing in an overcrowded lobby.  We overheard the hostess tell another patron that Fogo was running behind because people were taking longer than expected to eat.  I guess they did not account for folks actually wanting to enjoy their meal and their conversation on Valentine's Day.  We were taken to our table and our waiters greeted us with "Man, I am tired, can't wait until by shift ends."   - Sorry for the inconvenience.  We will try not to ask too much of you. -  Well, I think he read my thoughts because we went to the salad bar and returned to find that we still did not have our drinks, including water, or forks.  We did a quick check to see in anyone else was eating with their hands as part of the cultural experience.  But, they had forks and water, so we waited.  And waited... Finally, we flagged down a meat chef who kindly gave use the equipment necessary to begin our meal.  The food was average.  The steaks were great, but the lamb was gamey and the chicken was average and a bit dry.   The rolls were beautifully prepared and had an interesting texture.  We were invited to try their dessert, but decided that we did not want to overstay our welcome.  So we politely asked for our check and waited.... We did pass the time watching the waiters flip through the bills from other customers evaluating their tips like the IRS agents checking tax returns.  To be serious for a moment, for the price of this restaurant, we expected a more classic dining experience with a professional, attentive wait staff, etc. However, it may have just been a over overcrowded since it was Valentine's Day.   Yet, that is exactly why we picked this establishment in the first place....First, on a personal note, I can't eat a lot in one sitting, so all-you-can-eat places generally aren't for people like me. $65 to eat an amount of food I could get for a third of the price doesn't make sense to me. If you can eat $65 worth of meat, by all means, come here. I was pleased with the meats. All were prepared well, and the flavor was amazing. I got to have leg of lamb, lamb chops, various steaks, and some pork loin. All were satisfying and tasty. My problem is with two things: value for the dollar, and soft drinks. The website for the establishment says all beverages and desserts are extra. Fine. But for $65 a head, I think I should be able to have a bottomless beverage, not $4 for each 12 oz can of ginger ale. This is America. Get with the program. Bottomless beverages are expected in this country. Install a fountain. I got to try a bite of the key lime pie, and it was no better than a slice of Edward's frozen key lime pie that you can get in any grocery store. Why do I mention this? Because a single slice of key lime pie here is $8.50. I can get the whole pie and a can of whipped cream for that and still have change left over. I am a frugal person, and I believe this place lacks a few amenities that its price tag would usually indicate. I probably won't be back any time soon.

Restaurant name  Brutopia
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
Good people trying to make something that matters in the Montreal community. Jeff and his team both at Bru and at Jane are scrappy and pouring a lot of love and hard work into what they do. Like Hurley's, Brutopia is a haven on lower Crescent but Bru is generally a little younger and more rawkus. There are lots of small corners to tuck into, and sitting near the shiny brassy beer-making apparatus always makes me feel cozy. The food and beer might not be always superfoodie accolade winning, but for those of us just looking for good heart and a tasty good time somewhere away from tight pants and hairspray that dominates much of this strip, especially during F1, Brutopia is gold. The layout is pretty great for live music and quiz nights and open mics too; intimate but with a lofty upstairs perch that feels almost old timey.Je ne suis pas type bière, mais je suis allée dans ce pub une fois avec mon mari et des amis pour un 5 à 7. Il y a un bon choix de bières et d'alcool. Les prix sont raisonnables. On peut aussi y manger, il y a une cuisine. Le choix de mets est typique de ce type d'établissement: nachos, ailes de poulet, etc. La serveuse était assez gentille, l'ambiance était feutrée et sombre et la musique était raisonnable, donc on pouvait se parler sans crier à s'en briser les cordes vocales, ce que j'apprécie grandement quand je suis avec des copains!

Restaurant name  Don Pedro Mexican Restaurant

Review Text :
After five years, we're back to Don Pedro for a late lunch on the weekend. It hasn't changed at all. My daughter and I ended up in one of the booths along the wall.The food is still good and the portions are -massive-. The plate in the entryway is what you're going to end up with so be ready. I had the Deluxe Burrito and there was a ton of it. It might be hard to tell in my picture, but buried under that sour cream and guacamole is a large burrito stuffed with chicken.My daughter chose the chicken fajitas and there was also a lot there. Only three tortillas, but plenty of chicken, onions and peppers.Drinks were refilled. The queso is no longer a problem - it probably wasn't poured into a cold bowl so it stayed cheesy until our entrees arrived.Service was quick. Table-side guacamole is available too.If you're looking for fancier Mexican, you've found it. Don Pedro is a step above the usual Mexican places along Burrito Way.

Review Text :
I'd just like to thank Andrew K. for introducing me to this gem. You are a wonderful wonderful man because dudes, this place is delicious. Strawberries, Gorgonzola & candied pecans on fresh greens - hell yes. Perfect pizza crust that is crunchy on the outside and fluffy on the inside covered with delicious fresh toppings. Cozy seating AND a full bar. This place is pizza perfection and you need to go here immediately. The mouthgasm is totally worth the drive.I used to live by this Humble Pie and never went. Now that I live downtown I finally make it there? Go figure. I met the venerable Richard Z for lunch today. The other leg of the "Tripod", Dallas G was missing. The place wasn't too busy for lunch, but it was about 130 so the lunch rush may have already ended. We sat out on the patio since it was a typical 70 degree December day. Nice patio that is probably perfect at night. The menu had salads, pastas, and of course pizzas. They offer a pretty good lunch special of an 8" pizza and salad for $8.95. They have specific pizzas for this on specific days, but our server said we could have any pizza we wanted. I give credit to Mr. Z and his charm for that. I decided on the Artichoke which had fontina and ricotta cheese, 3 different olives, and caramelized onions. I got the Veggie salad which had jicima, romaine, tomatoes, green beans, avacado, white beans, and fresh mozzarella with a herb vinagrette. The salad was very tasty. Z had the Cesar which he noted that the croutons were amazing. He subsequently bit his tongue in half following this statement. There was blood and everything.Our pizzas came out before we were done with the salads, which is a bit of a pet peeve of mine. Mine was very good, but I wish the crust wasn't as bready and a little more well done. Otherwise perfectly delicious. Z got the Egg pizza which had a sunny side up egg and panceta. He seemed very pleased with his selection. I could tell by the sounds coming from across the table. I also enjoyed one of the iciest Stellas I have ever had. Perfect for a day like today.Overall a very good experience and I would definitely come back to this location or any of the others throughout the valley. Well done Humble Pie.

Restaurant name  Sadie's Soulful Southern
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
I had read about Sadie's a while back, and figured that we needed to check it out.  I might not be a true Southerner, but I'm getting there, having lived in the South for going on twenty years now.  I can enjoy some Soul Food with the best of them.The big problem that I have is that Sadie's, as much as the name would indicate and people would like to believe, doesn't really hit me as soul food.Yes, Tamara (Sadie was her grandmother) serves chicken and waffles.  But the waffles are sweet potato waffles with cinnamon and other spices (you do get these with chicken wings).  The waffles are served with pre-packaged butter and syrup, on paper plates with plastic utensils.  I don't mind that they use those, but rather than tossing the butter and syrup on the table, get a bottle of Aunt Jemima's and a nice dispenser.  Even better, buy some maple syrup from Cracker Barrel.  The Food Detectives showed how much presentation can change things, and it would make a huge difference here.Another thing is the menu itself.  There are items like red beans and rice and fried corn on the cob (which is excellent - at least as good as R&R in Concord).  But they also have a quesadilla.  Since when is that soul food?  It's not that it's bad, either.  In fact, it might be the best thing on the menu, which just makes matters worse.Sadie's does have some good tea (not quite as sweet as my granny's, but good), and overall the experience is solid.  But it's not great.  The main problem, other than the menu issues above, was service.  They might have been missing some staff or something, but service was SLOW.  When we came in, it took several minutes to even be greeted.  It was a long time after that to receive drinks, and we received our appetizer (the quesadilla) just as we were about to give up.  Our dinner came just a minute or so later, and that was when they weren't busy!  As we were leaving, things really picked up - though much of it was orders to go.

Restaurant name  Blu Sushi
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
We will not be going back to Blu. I've said this before, but we always seem to get invited by different people, and we've given in. But this time, it's official, as I promised to write a review on behalf of 7 other people that were a part of our group on Friday night. There's no one left who would want to go back there amongst our group of friends. Our experience was so bad, it was surreal. Just some of the highlights:It should say something, when before even going in, when the other restaurant's on the same strip are on a wait and packed, and there are 3 guests in Blu at 6:30 on a Friday night. We committed to meeting a large party, though, so it worked for us, on this occasion.We went in, and our party got there at staggered times, couple by couple, which should have made it easy to keep things separate.  After 4 of us were there (2 couples), the server came up to us, and made a big deal about having separate checks. Keep in mind that there were a total of 7 guests in the whole restaurant at this point. She kept pointing out on the menu that their policy is that they won't do it. We didn't argue or really make much of a comment, but she kept repeating it to us. She finally said that they would do it, but with major protest to herself.At 7:00, a sushi chef came around, turned on a disco ball, and cranked the music so loudly (still, less than 10 guests in the whole place), it was difficult to hear each other across the table.  The 2 sushi chefs would frequently yell out (think hibachi) and partake in sake shots. During our 2 hours there, we saw one of the chefs (who referred to himself as Charlie) take at least 7 shots, growing louder and more obnoxious with each one. At one point, Charlie came over to our table started dancing ON one of the women with us, and asked who wanted to arm-wrestle.  One of our visiting guests, jokingly took him up on it, and ended up with Charlie taking him down on the floor, fully wrestling him, arm around his neck and (I'm not exaggerating) touching him inappropriately. Seriously.This is not even a reflection of the food...yet.  4 of the 8 of us ordered cooked rolls, which we have had in the past. Normally they take some time to get, but come out piping hot. This time, they were unrecognizable, and COLD. We actually asked the chef about it, and he went on a rant, about he doesn't make it the same way that they last chef did, and that his way was better. He actually said that the last chef was an a**hole, before he took the cold rolls away. When we were (oh so) ready to leave, we asked for our check(s). You could immediately tell this was stressful for our server, who disappeared for a solid 10 minutes, re-appeared to tell us she needed a break from our checks, and that she would be in the bathroom (necessary??), and returned another 10 minutes later. The total experience was bad enough, but finding out that the pricing had increased at least 20-30% with the new management, put the nail in the coffin. $11 dollars for a goose and soda? I would expect this pricing in Scottsdale or at a hotel, but in Litchfield Park, not at all. We will not be going back...don't even think about giving it a try. We have...multiple times. Service is always an issue, but this was above and beyond! There are much better sushi options in the West Valley!

Restaurant name  Primarily Prime Rib Restaurant
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
We came here for dinner before a show.  We had no reservation but since it was only 5:30, we were seated promptly.  Our order for iced teas were taken promptly.  We were brought a basket of sliced bread and some butter.  My wife ordered the Cottage Pie with split pea soup for an appetizer.  I got the South Point cut of prime rib with a baked potato.  For my starter I got the prime salad with bleu cheese dressing.My wife enjoyed her soup.  My salad was tossed table side on a classic style steakhouse cart.  The greens and dressing were in the wooden bowl when he pushed the cart to the table.  He mixed the dressing and greens together.  It was quite good and a server gave me some freshly ground pepper.Our main courses arrived and my prime rib was very rare as I ordered.  My baked potato was loaded with butter and sour cream as I asked and I was given a side of creamy horseradish.  I opted not to get the blackened cajun thanks to Philip T's review.  I also don't like that the "blackening" process cooks the meat more than I care for.For dessert, my wife got the tartufo, a white chocolate and raspberry dessert that consisted of a ball of raspberry sherbet surrounded by some vanilla ice cream covered with white chocolate.  There were some fresh berries with it also.  I got the chocolate layer cake which was not a standard slice of cake but rather a two layer round cake frosted with chocolate and also served with fresh berries.The meal was good and service was very good.  Robert and Jayme made a good team for the table.  This was a good meal and something different to try.

You know when you go on holiday to an exotic European city and you want to find the perfect restaurant off the beaten tourist-trail - an authentic neighbourhood, hidden up a tiny alley, best-food-in-the-City type places? Whilst Edinburgh is already full of amazing eateries and luckily is scarce in the Promenade / Plaza aforementioned types, finding Sweet Melinda's felt like I'd unearthed one of the Old Town's best kept secrets.Nestled in Marchmont in the innocuous spot between the fishmongers and fruit shops, and literally hidden behind a huge draping red curtain is the most wonderful wee restaurant, serving exquisite meals, that is both fine dining due to quality of food but also homely and friendly complete with creaky floorboards. It feels like eating in an old-fashioned dining room or a Parisian basement restaurant that was founded circa 1940s and hasn't changed much since (more to its benefit), and you half expect a man with an accordion to emerge from the waiting area to serenade you, and then once you've finished your meal to step out out of the restaurant onto the banks of the Seine.  A fish restaurant, there are also meat options, and everything is just wonderful.There were 5 in our party, and whilst we were told that we would only have the table from 7 - 9pm that wasn't a huge problem. We did overstay by about 15 minutes, as we were enjoying the cheese so much, but the staff were ever courteous and attentive, and apologetic. It's August in Edinburgh, we completely understood and weren't put out.The menu is a set two courses at £22. Whilst I appreciate that not everyone is willing to pay for two courses, I would say for the quality of the food it's good value. Despite there being 5 in our party, we all ended up ordering very similar meals. All of us had the squid salad to start, and there were 3 rack of lambs with sweet potato mash and black pudding, and 2 sea bass fillets.The lime and coriander dressing on the salad was beautiful, and there was a moderate portion of squid. But the rack of lamb. Oh my. I requested mine medium-rare but was told by the waiter this wasn't a problem as it's all served that way. And medium rare it certainly was. The black pudding was far too moreish, and the whole meal just cooked beautifully. (Check out the photos).The cheese board to finish, along with our port and whisky, was a wonderful way to wind up the meal. The dark chocolate truffle, evidently home-made,served with the coffees was, dare I say, orgasmic.I love the red, draping curtain concealing the entrance to the restaurant. And the curious antique photos and pictures on the wall. And the creaky floor boards. And the friendly staff. And the food. And the fact this is a real neighbourhood restaurant in Marchmont that is focusing on doing what it does best. The fact that it's a fish restaurant and I didn't have fish as my main means I simply need to go back... just have to find the occasion!

How had I not discovered the $2 trio earlier? I will soon be duchess no doubt. The windows that line the front of the restaurant allow plenty of light despite it being slightly lower than street level. The cashier was a doll and you could tell by listening to her interactions with regulars that she's part of the charm and reason for the repeat business. I splurged the extra 25 cents for garlic sauce in my wrap and I would suggest you do the same. I was impressed at the significant choice of soups and was pleasantly surprised that they make a point of serving the juice in a larger-than-normal styrofoam cup rather than something that doesn't hold more than a juice-box. You won't find a better lunch for $2, that I can guarantee.As a fairly cheap and broke Concordia student, I like this place. I REALLY like this place.The 2$ trio became 2.50$ trio (including cheap drink in a styrofoam cup, a falafel sandwich and a soup of your choice). It is THE best quality/price Lebanese restaurant I ever set foot in.Granted, the portions seem smaller than other Lebanese restaurants but it's still at a higher quantity/price ratio that I've ever seen. The pitas are the freshest I've ever tasted and the service is fairly fast. The lady at the counter seems hateful towards life but is actually really friendly if you bother to throw more than a "Hi I'd like X, Y and Z please" at her.The place is kind of small and cramped but with those prices, it's to be expected. The chairs at the tables seemed to have been stolen at a local daycare center and the tables wobble.Recommended. :)

Harry's is a NO.I am often leery of restaurants in hotels but I thought in the Mission Palms it should be safe.  I stand corrected.Giving credit where credit is due, the service was friendly and attentive throughout the meal although at this point I am wondering if there was some duplicity going on here.  I'll return to that.I had the fish & chips.  It was both soggy and overdone.  To accomplish this you first have to cook it too long.  Then to get rid of the crispiness you have to cover it with something and let it sit a few minutes so that the food gets moist from condensation.  The fries were lukewarm and soggy.  After I ate I excused myself and went to the restroom to use some floss because the overdone fish had stuck between my teeth quite generously.  Uck.  But here's the real rub:  They added an 18% gratuity without saying anything.  In the semidarkness of the outdoor seating area I did not catch this and added in another roughly 18% tip.  Later as we were heading home and talking about dinner we realized it seemed kind of high.  We'll be addressing the bill with the restaurant and contesting the charges on the credit card.  In the meantime, be warned.  Seriously, wtf?Oh and parking is valet only and they were pretty disorganized.Update:  they refunded the charges.

5 shining stars for Jun i. One of my top 3 meals this year.Sushi is fresh and inventive. No cream cheese rolls here. We had an Indian-inspired roll over a yogurt curry sauce and fought over the last piece.The kitchen specialties are pricey but completely worth it. Roasted scallop, langoustine and snapper over saffron scallop stock and parsley cream was the best thing I've had in my mouth in quite a while.Soups, tea and sake are also fantastic.Sleek, calming nature-inspired decor with cozy, (fake) furry-backed chairs.Perfection.A Sante~

Review Text :
I love good food. I love Italian food. Valvona & Crolla's is the epic Italian deli of Edinburgh, having been here for almost 100 years. The deli up the front of their original Elm Row branch is wonderous, like Willy Wonka's for meat, cheese and pasta lovers. I love it.The caffe bar up the back sells all their delicious food stuffs, which is good. So why the three stars?The boy and I came here for breakfast. A £30 breakfast is transpired. Yes, we weren't counting as we ordered but we normally order the same thing where ever we go and it usually ranges from £10 - £20. The usual being normally two types of cooked (poached eggs and bacon, or smoked salmon), a tea and coffee, and two OJs. The only difference here was the boy also ordered one of their fresh chocolate croissants for after (they are that good).So either the chocolate croissant was £10 good or their prices are just generally higher. I can't actually remember the individual prices, but paying £30 for two for breakfast is a wee bit much. The food really is great and they are an Edinburgh institution so I think the prices reflect this. But when I can get equally good cooked breakfast elsewhere at half the price..well you do the maths.The other thing that I don't know if they could change is the space itself. It only has sky lights so whilst there's light, there's no view. The decor is quite dated and the chairs and tables are spread out across a rectanguar floor in a very orderly order (ehh you know what I mean). It just feels a little soulless. This is a total contrast to the dark, high-ceilinged, meat-strewn deli up front. It just isn't somewhere I'd *want* to go for long leisurely brunch or lunch. Which is a real shame.Don't get me wrong, I love their deli, I like their other cafés (despite that they're also really pricey) and I love their food. But the prices are just too high and there are other places nearby with much more personality.

Review Text :
Back to my days as the doorman at the Wyndham across the street, I used to watch construction of this restaurant. Such a great old building, and I was so happy they were finally doing something with it. I've watched progress in person and in pictures, as well as chatted about it with my friends, and three years later it is finally something.The inside of the building is beautiful. Absolutely stunning. They did a great job with the old department store, and utilized a lot of space very efficiently. There are some neat touches here and there, one being the empty elevator shaft with a plexiglass cover, and some mirrors so you can seemingly see forever. It's not that deep! The restrooms upstairs (shame they are ALL upstairs) are awesome, in a white room surrounded with mirrors. I felt like I was in a padded asylum with mirrors, the asylum because I couldn't figure the place out. There is a DJ booth above the front door that is very easy to miss, and really a cool touch. The colors are all browns to keep with the nostalgic theme, and did I mention there are mirrors everywhere? The building and space get a 5. It's just cool.We sat at the bar and were followed by a friendly little asian guy, with menus and he seemed genuinely interested in us having a good experience. He was previously across the street asking people to come over and try the restaurant. I wish I could say the bartender was half as friendly or committed to his job. The bald one was extremely unfriendly, seemed very arrogant, and for a person in a loud restaurant should practice his vocal skills. The service was prompt without mishaps throughout, but very cold.I ordered the Carne Pizza. I have to say, it was one of the biggest disappointments I have had in a loooooong time. I have made better pizzas in my home oven that came from a box. Honestly... it had a paper thin cardboard like crust, no quality toppings, and not exactly a memorable taste. It tasted fine, and that was it's only redeeming quality. My neighbor had the roast beef sandwich and it was no better, or higher quality. The deli counter at Safeway can make a better sandwich. I earlier chastised someone for judging food on opening night, but now I see it really is bad, there is really no quality.  No sandwiches come with sides. No fries, no fruit, no salad, nothing. They are about $10, and if I want a great sandwich for $10 I'll go to Switch, and it will come with a great Caesar Salad on the side.This is not a restaurant, but rather a bar that serves food. If I think of it like that... more like a bigger version of The Roosevelt, I can think a little more positive about this, but not much. Bad service, bad food, bad review. I'll not be coming back, even with the walking distance proximity. It's just not worth it, especially for the price, and to feel like a not busy staff doesn't want to be busy. We are now at the point where there are other options downtown that are better. It's no longer a Downtown where you can be mediocre and survive.If you're a fan of AZ88 and are expecting Hanny's to be a downtown clone, you'll be partly pleased. The design, decor + ambiance will feel somewhat familiar, as will the quality of drinks at the bar (aside from much smaller martinis) - but the food at Hanny's is a strange departure from the top-notch bar food found at it's sister restaurant in Scottsdale.While still bar food, Hanny's offers an odd assortment of pizzas, sandwiches and salads. And not a big assortment, either. Everything we tried tasted OK, but sounded better on the menu than it actually was. Portions were also disappointing for the price, especially the chopped salad, which was half the size of the chopped at AZ88 - and half as good - for about the same price. The oven-fired pizzas had a nice thin, crispy crust, but toppings were just so-so and felt uninspired. Sandwich selections were more inspired, but only slightly appealing, from Charred Pork to the P.A.T., a fancy BLT made with pancetta and arugula. The Bar Plate was probably our favorite item, though still just OK - fresh prosciutto (sliced at the bar on a very cool Euro-style slicer), chunks of parmigiano-reggiano, slices of melon, and ciabatta bread - good, but nothing to write home about.What is worth writing about is the place itself - a must-see, and just what downtown needed. Sleek, urban and the coolest industrial rehabbing around - from the clever open elevator shaft to the maze of bathroom stalls. And once the rooftop patio and basement lounge open, this place will surely be the hottest spot in town.As for now, stop in, check it out, have a drink or two or three, and enjoy the beginning of a new era for downtown Phoenix. Just hope the menu improves with age...After Happy Hour last Friday the J-Man and I found ourselves not in the mood to go home, but in the mood to continue our fun out in downtown Phoenix. After meeting with 2 of the most bad ass Yelpers at our place- Stevey P and Mr. K- we headed out to Hanny's to meet with more of Yelp's best- Bonnie G., Erica O., and Lauren V. Hanny's proved to be a fun and interesting place for us to relax. We didn't try any of the food since we had eaten earlier but we sampled the drinks and explored the space. I ordered up a mojito, which came with an unexpected dark rum float on the top. It was strong on the liquor but not on the mint. Perhaps next time I'll try a mai tai. After that I sampled a drink brought over from AZ88, the Moscow Mule, which was very nice and refreshing. The bar area is nice and large, the bartenders friendly. The prosciutto slicer in the middle is, um, well its odd. The space is incredible. There are so many areas to explore, nooks and crannies to find. Some are cool (room of light and mirrors, white room, upstairs balcony, front part of the upstairs that overlooks Adams) some are creepy (the elevator shaft freaked me out, the stairs up to who knows whereâ) However, its clear that the space was a department store. The central bar on the main floor was obviously the cosmetics counter and my husband kept getting whiffs of a floral smell, which I have to assume was the ghost of a crazy perfume lady past. I think Hanny's has great potential...there are no other places like it downtown. It just needs people. So please, everyone go there. When do you hear me say that in a Yelp review? Never. But Hanny's is within walking distance of my place and could be a great destination downtown when one wants to enjoy a night at a nice lounge.Check out the "Tongue" couch and stand on the glass floor look down the abandoned elevator shaft, trippy to say the least. Great addition to downtown.  Sleek and contemporary interior.  Soon  they may have a club downstairs according to our server.  Upstairs is a neat, albeit slightly odd space.  They have a DJ in a small room over the main entrance, look for him.TRY THE BAR PLATE!!!  It's about $7 and you get fresh shaved Parmesan and prosciutto, melon and bread.   It's so F'ing good.They have Pimm's, but I don't know to much about it but it tasted OK to me.---IMPORTANT: the "pizzas" are not normal, they are super thin, I mean like 1/2 of a tortilla thin.  Tasty, but not a filling as a normal thin crust pizza.Darn snazzy place.So, it can ONLY be a good sign when you walk into a place and see a giant wheel of Parmigiano-Reggiano, right? I mean, I'm pretty certain this Italian girl could sustain herself on one of those perfectly-aged, salty wheels for, like, at least 6 months! So, I was DELIGHTED when that was the first thing to catch my eye upon entering Hanny's this past weekend.Then, to be able to enjoy a Pimm's Cup No. 1 (Corbin's Bar & Grill is the only other place I've found it as prominently displayed in the Valley). Pimm's Cup No. 1 is an English gin-based, slightly spiced and citrus flavored liqueur. The version offered on the drink list at Hanny's is a gingery, cucumbery, bitters-like concoction. I spent the summer of 2006 drinking Pimm's lemonade, so was excited to hear Hanny's has fresh squeezed lemonade.  But, I found their lemonade to be too sour and will probably stick with the standard Pimm's Cup next time I'm there.As for the ambiance, I liked it. It felt crisp and contemporary to me. Also, unfinished... which it is. I'm looking forward to watching this place develop!My 4 stars for Hanny's are driven almost completely by the atmosphere of this converted department store. A friend and I met up for drinks there last Friday, and lingered for around 5 hours (another friend was flying in from NYC and his flight was delayed several times, so the rounds kept coming). Several people have commented negatively on the service, lighting or music, but they must be working out the kinks with all of the above because they were spot-on during our visit. The DJ was spinning a combination of subtle vibe-enducing music mixed with "oh, I LOVE this song" uncovered and unexpected old favorites. The lighting gradually shifting during the evening, so that by midnight it was a cozy and romantic mood. Speaking of, let me just say it: something about this place just felt...sexy. I don't know if it was the music, the lighting, the "baby it's cold outside" week before Christmas, or my malbec-shiraz. The things-could-happen-here feel especially hit me when I went upstairs and saw the unisex restrooms all lined up; white unmarked doors all in a row to their own little rooms -- it was straight out of a Madonna video circa 1995! Biggest watchout: the martini glasses were offensively and ridiculously tiny. I mean, really?!? I had read about this in reviews before going, but I was so shocked at the size that I refused to order one and stuck with wine (which I wouldn't say was a "healthy" pour, but at least took me more than 4 sips to finish). The menu is also relatively limited. We shared the bar plate and a prosciutto pizza (added mushrooms) and enjoyed both, but neither were outstanding or very filling. All-in-all, I will definitely recommend this place to friends for drinks or drinks/apps. It's a unique space with a great vibe and I am sure it will do well once word gets out.200th review! And on the last day of December 2008, of all days. 2008 was a great year for Phoenix Yelp but not for Phoenix itself as one local business after another closed its doors and efforts to revitalize downtown didn't do so well. Anyone who attended the downtown pub crawl can attest to that. I really believe that 2009 can be a better year for Phoenix, though, and I think that the light rail being open (and creating a flow up and down the central corridor) will definitely help. The other thing I think will help is entrepreneurs like Karl Kopp (the owner of Hanny's) being willing to take risks and open businesses that may not necessarily fit the cookie cutter mold of what a "cool" Phoenix establishment should be. I really applaud him for that. In some sense, opening a business that's different than what people are used to or expect helps you create a cult following--not everyone will like you, but if enough people refuse to listen to the other people who don't like you, you will create a pretty passionate crowd of supporters. I really think that Hanny's will gain this type of cult following and then over time, as similar types of businesses gain a footing in Phoenix, it will become a place everyone accepts. Or that won't happen and I'll pray that enough people start to see the magic so that Hanny's won't be the next business to close!In case you think that I only like Hanny's because it's different or new, I want to emphasize that I also really liked the food and drinks my husband and I tried. Yes, the martinis were small (my husband had the special Hanny's martini with vodka and gin and I had a French martini), but they were mixed well and at only $5, my husband's was well priced for the size. We also both thought the food was really well executed. We especially loved the pizza with prosciutto and arugula. The crust was definitely too thin even for "Roman style"--having been to Rome five times, I can tell you that the crust there has a bit more substance to it, but the ingredients on Hanny's pizza were simple and fresh, which I know to be an authentically Italian approach to pizza making. But I can see how you might be disappointed if you are used to very saucy and savory pizza. The pork loin sandwich was also really good--the thinly sliced pork was very flavorful and the bread was nice and crusty. The green peppers were a bit strange, though, as they made the pork taste more Mexican inspired than Italian. That being said, though, I'm kind of content overall to not try to force Hanny's into a box. What I like about the place is its slight imperfections and its inability to be easily defined. Is it a bar? a restaurant? a lounge? I don't really know, but I don't really care. I think its unique character make it a great destination for those who are looking for something different in Phoenix, and I hope that it survives the economic slump that the city has been going through. If it does, maybe it will expand its offerings and become a place that everyone can appreciate.Hanny's ... you have quite the tasty Riesling. But...your service leaves a tad bit to be desired.On the flip side, you have hot hot hot bartenders, so I really don't mind the wait (sorry DG).My favorite thing about you is your bathrooms. I mean, I really really love the bathrooms. Actually, I love the entire place. If I were going to open a bar, I would want it to look exactly like Hanny's. Well, except the meat cutter at the bar, because I am vegetarian. Perhaps I would get an industrial strength cheese cutter. (ha ha ... cheese cutter!)Ooooo another bonus... you are right off of the light rail and you normally have parking available right outside... therefore I consider you to be in a good location.Yeah, Hanny's ... I love you. Quite a bit. Let's go steady.3.5I'm a fan, but not a devout fan. So I guess that rounds down to 3 stars.I have visited Hanny's twice. I LOVE the building, and the modern/wacky decor. I would imagine this place packed full if it were in NYC. I was there last Friday and I loved the vibe that the DJ created while he chose to spin soulful R&B. It was great. Our server, Tyrone, was a rock star. He handled our large group without a problem and he was quick with the service. Everyone at the table decided to order something and then pass it around. I had the pizza with pepperoni and onion, which was tasty. I think everything was great. The loser of the evening was the onion strings. I really wouldn't waste your time unless you were madly craving a whole plate of onion strings. I know people have complained about the teeny-tiny martinis. Don't judge too quickly. Those little things actually pack a good punch.What I don't love is the VERY limited and unimaginative menu. Listen up people, you can only do thin crust pizzas, and paninis at so many places before the trend wears out. Hanny's menu is so limited that I couldn't see myself going to eat there very often because I would be eating the same things. I really hope they expand their menu. Maybe offer a nightly special? Is that asking too much? I will most certainly go to Hanny's again. I don't know if I would go for dinner necessarily, but it's a great place to start the night out in Downtown Phoenix!Hanny's is two things..and neither at full potential.1st, it is very chic and modern in a retro feel. as far the the interior style and potential i give it 5 stars. i was told the basement will be a full blown dance club in the future. but for now..this place is completely underused. there is a second bar upstairs, but on a friday night i counted more open tables then filled ones..so clearly the second bar is premature.2nd, the pizza tastes good, the flavor i thought was there. but give me a fucking break, 17 bucks for a crispy saltine baked at 600 degrees with some toppings...drinks were strong..saving grace on the menu side of this review. but i think the pricing is seriously out of wack for what you get.no free birthday dessert...better and lesser places have no problem doing this. hell if i was a server..i would have compped it either way..it was a table of 10 people drinking and my tip alone was 40 bucks. not to mention the unrequested table bread....that was put on my bill..WHAT THE FUCK!!!it will be awhile before i come back to Hanny'slike i said the potential for a 5 star awesome place is there. but seriously the clown menu needs some revisions..if you want to charge this much for dining, get a real menu deserving of it. hopefully the wait staff too. at one point in the night i saw 3 servers standing around by the main entrance. look busy asshole. coolest thing would be the DJ nest over the dining area. also the bathrooms, which i believe used to be dressing rooms. i can totally see some awesome carnal experiances in these private bathrooms. but i think it's kinda weird the bathrooms are 20 feet from the upstairs bar..and in line of sight...Hanny's i wish you the best..and hope you can grow up to be what you want to be. send me a kite when you do..i look forward to hearing from you.What a cool spot! Came here the other night for a drink and was pleasantly surprised that a place that used to be a clothing store could be turned into such a charming lounge. Feeling a little adventurous, and because I freakin' LOVE Brazilians, I opted for the Capiriana.. Fortunately, the bartender did not disappoint because these can be hit or miss. It even came with a sugar stick lolly-pop, pink I may add, so that was pretty neat. Feeling the munchies come on, I ordered the snack plate, which came with a variety of sliced meats and cheeses, along with pistachios, bread & olives.. perfect for sharing too! The interior is huge, and very open.. I love that the bar is situated directly in the middle too, friendly bartenders and tons of seating. . Unfortunately I didn't venture to the bathroom, which is supposed to be a site to see.. maybe next time.We were downtown chic last week and attended a Mercury game (VIP I might add...for whatever that's worth!) and dined afterward at Hanny's. WOW! Walking in I felt the heaven's had opened and the choir was a-singin'! This space should be my home. Beautiful, modern decor with the right lighting casting a soothing blanket of warmth. Nice. Greeted immediately we sat at a high top table near the window. I was so consumed with the fabulous company I was with I hadn't realized something. We. Were. The. Only. Diners. A few bar flies scattered around the bar in the middle of the room. 9:15 on a Thursday. My heart sank. Or was I actually slipping off the bar stool from those two $9 beers from the Mercury game? The good:Well, service was swift and friendly. Though he seemed a tad nervous. Perhaps because we smelled of lesbians. Not sure. Ambience. Duh! Covered that. Including the restrooms and the glassed in elevator shaft. I still get dizzy just thinking of that!PIZZA. Yep. I never would order pizza in a non pizza place. Rickie did. Rickie won. Rickie ate. Carne pizza. Order it!The bad:TINY martinis. Who makes these? Barbie? Tattoo from Fantasy Island? The Lucky Charm leprachaun?Empty room. Bummer. I like a good, energetic, lively vibe. But we did entertain ourselves with lively banter about nothing important and most certainly became shallow and caddy. Realllllly, makes you want to hang out with me, eh?The ugly:My sandwich. The prime rib, with thick slabs o bacon, fried egg on ciabatta. Steak Umms. Was all I could compare it to. So disappointed. One thin, thin, thin, strip of, er, um, prime rib *cough* *cough* Steak Umms. Dry. Bland. Overcooked. Like my Aunt Helen after too much Chardonnay at a backyard BBQ. Onion strings, however, FANTASTIC.My other diner/Mercury fans were OK with their sandwiches; I remember one had pork the other hard boiled eggs. Not sure exactly. Sorry. Those $9 beers really did a number on me. The good Part 2 Electric Boogaloo:Onion strings! Had to repeat. I WILL GO BACK TO YOU HANNY'S. It was sort of like an awkward first date. Started off dicey. In the middle we had some laughs and wiped mayo from our lips. But did we kiss at the end of the night? Hmmm...not so sure. Let's see what happens on that second date.I really like Hanny's, even after my most recent experience there.  The bottom line is that Hanny's is a great place with good food and terrific classic-style cocktails.  The Pimm's Cup is fantastic, for example.  The DJ deserves mad props as well, and the whole place is fairly gorgeous.  I love the decor and the reclining booths.  Basically this is a great spot for a bite and a couple drinks.  I've had a couple pizzas, a sandwich, and a taste of the cauliflower veggie plate, and while nothing was exactly stand-out awesome, (although now that i say that my mind goes back to the meat-lovers' pizza i sampled and my mouth starts watering...) i would order any of it again.  The one uneven spot has been the service.  The first time i was ever here, only a month ago, we were served by a novice, and it showed.  painfully so.  the times i've visited since, we've had experienced servers who have done their job pretty well.I am in love with Hanny's.  They now have a new upscale classic drink menu that is on the pricey side, but looks AMAZING.  So far, I've tried the English Garden, which supplants any other mixed drink I've had as the best summer beverage.  It's 13 dollars, and contains the perfect proportions of Hendrick's Gin, St. Germain liqueur, and muddled cucumber.  Quite refreshing, strong, and yet incredibly quaffable.  Check it out.This place is so sexy.I actually spent my most recent birthday celebration here with some great friends because the days of parading around half-naked in nightclubs are a tad behind me now. They have an amazing drink menu here. The Moscow Mule comes in an adorable copper cup that makes you want to commit a small crime. I would also definitely recommend the St. Germain. It's a sweet martini, but one of the best I've ever had. This place also makes me want to buy a meat slicer and a slab of prosciutto for my own home.  Hanny's is definitely one of Phoenix's finest gems. It has a great deal of personality. Drinks, food, and tunes are always fantastic. See you there!Recently visited Hanny's for the first time and received crap service from a waitress with an attitude. She was not willing to happily accommodate any requests and acted put-off at anything we asked about or asked for. Plus, the place wasn't even busy while we were there, it was pretty empty. That's how you drive customers away.I went to the restaurant and my party spent over $300. My phone was stolen in the restroom with the district manager Alex less than 5 ft away. I asked for him to please make an announcement, or call my ph to see whom answered. He refused stated " It would kill his ambiance" and walked away. He refused to allow me to use the restaurant phone to call the police to file a report, he refused to provide me with the ownersw name or any contact info, he did not allow his staff to give me their names. The waitress actually said he was horrible to work with and apologized to me but she needed her job so she could not side with me in front of him. Actually Alex called the police ON ME as a trespasser. The police apologize to me when they arrived. Alex lied to the police and treated me like a dog. I will never frequent that restaurant again.I walked in with a 4-star expectation and walked out with an exhausted jaw.  :-\"Can I get some fabric softener up in here, please?!"  Why?"Cuz this son of a b*tch is hard as hell to eat!"Never again shall I torture myself through that.  *_*On paper, the roast beef sandwich sounded like a home run.  Who doesn't like roast beef that is griiiilllled? complemented with fried egg and bacon.It didn't help that the ciabatta was just as tough to chew.  Boy, was it a loooong lunch.  One bite after another, thinking about all the starving children of the world.  I'm doing it for you guys, you hear me?! You guys!!!Alas, I finished every single bite.  A few things that could improve this sandwich: use butter, perhaps make the meat a little rare, and use softer bread!The only thing that saved this whole lunch was their homemade doughnuts.  It was soft and airy complemented with their fresh strawberry sauce and chocolate.Another fail was trying to find their restroom, which I never found! I was told to head up the stairs and through mirrored hallway?! As contemporary as this place was, this creepy area I went to just did not fit the picture.  I eventually came across this narrow hallway with mirrors all around and then all of sudden it got bright with a bunch of doors.  I seriously felt like I was at a carnival and I was suppose to choose, Door #1, Door #2, or Door #3.  Where the freak did I end up? Did I just enter the Twighlight Zone? Doo-dee-Doo-Doo...Doo-dee-Doo-Doo#creepyHanny's is hidden in the midst of Downtown Phoenix and I believe it was one of the first "trendy" restaurants to hit Downtown Phoenix. I've visited a couple of times for cocktails and then more recently for food. The atmosphere, cocktails and overall lay-out is cool, but the food is just A-ok as is the service. The service was pretty slow-moving and we soon learned that this is probably not the best spot to stop by if you're on a time limit. The food itself is decent, but the selections to choose from on the menu are pretty random. I couldn't quite pin point the type of cuisine this restaurant would be categorized as, but it's a hefty selection of Mediterranean eats such as prosciutto, cheeses, paninis and pizzas. The pizzas are only around $11 and they are easily able to be shared. The salads are also pretty large in size and could easily be shared as well. In summary, this is a good spot to have a couple after-work cocktails and maybe stay for an appetizer or two, but I'll probably keep Hanny's at just that for me and choose another location for my meal, especially if I have to be somewhere! *** If you visit be sure to visit the bathrooms on the second floor. It's like walking into an Alice in Wonderland maze.Well Hanny's. Since that first, really, rather awkward first date we had, I'm pleased to say that you have won my heart. I've been back many times since and have some delicious and playful culinary delights to please my Culinary Comedian palate.From the bruschetta to your steak and your awesome Manhattan's...you most deservedly earn at least one extra star. Loving the banquettes with the backs that ever so slightly recline. Think airplane seat recline. But with more leg room. And better food. Though I must say, the restrooms on an airplane, though small, are more convenient than yours. What is it? The fifth floor? Sixth? I forget.Loving you Hanny's. Dare I say we are actually dating now? The real deal? Next time I see you let's hug and I'll give you a little slap on the ass!I have been a frequent goer to this restaurant while living in the city and while the food and drinks are great, the service is absolutely terrible. I have never met such an overly arrogant and prideful staff. They feel that as long as you have a minor issue, it is your fault and not theirs. For example, my friend specifically asked for the midnight martinis, it is 12:02 PM. She serves us full sized martinis. My friend was a little concerned that the waitress didn't hear us correctly, and to make sure we were not being charged full priced, she flagged the waitress over to which she says "those are full priced martinis." My friend proceeds to state that we have specifically requested midnight martinis to which the waitress responds "I didn't hear you.". So instead of apologizing for the misunderstanding and offering the midnight specials, she retaliates and gets defensive. Because of her incompetence, we request to speak to the manager to which he towers over the table and asks "What's going on here?". oh hi, nice to see you too. He didn't even introduce himself properly nor professionally. I was so turned off by the negative and defensive attitude, that I have just about had it with that place. IT is not the first time I have received this poor service, and they need to get off their high horse and get their game together. Sorry i'm not sorry Hanny's, but we're going to have to part ways.What is a huge turn off of all, is knowing that after scrolling through these reviews, 1 out 5 customers are very unhappy with the service provided and almost all have the same context, "servers and waitstaff are rude". I am pleading out to the owner of Hanny's: For the sake of you're great restaurant, please hire new management and waitstaff, they are making you look horrible!!!**Warning****Warning****Warning**This review is NSFW (Not Safe For Work). You might just end up reading it, calling in sick, *cough*, *cough*, catching a ride (cab, light rail, uber, lyft, friend, bicycle, skateboard, roller skates, shoes, or slippers) and spending your day at Hanny's instead.Hanny's has a special place in my heart. Oh, Hanny's. You're close enough to my house to be an easy light rail destination, and just far enough for me to stay away most of the time. "Dangerous curves ahead" doesn't even begin to cover the tepidness one should take while ordering your $5 martini's, especially when you order them on the rocks, in a tumbler glass, and a couple of limes to dress it up instead. Your $5 martini special is always special and that's just why I like you, you make every hour happy and not just the hours between 3pm and 6pm ;-)The one complaint I hear from most people and many reviews is that at Hanny's, there's no Happy Hour, I think you just have to know to order their $5 martinis. I generally consider happy hours to be happy only when they come coupled with a decent drink selection AND food selection, but those martini's, they make up for it.Happy Yelping Phoenix, set your limit at two, possibly even one, be sure you've got a DD and have the happiest of hours.Been in a few times now and have had fun every time. Love the food, love the drinks, hate the service. The best thing I have to say is this place is amazingly consistent. If you loved a drink or menu item before you'll love it again because it's totally consistent.  The service is also consistent in making you feel like a total bother. They're not all out rude but there's no hiding that they'd rather be somewhere else.

Restaurant name  Red Ribbon Bakeshop
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
I had heard of this bakery from a competitor who holds shop in Chandler.  I have fond memories of delicious cakes from Red Ribbon from birthday parties of years past back home.   Filipinos LOVE to throw a party, and I swear cakes from Red Ribbon were always present.  You can imagine the nostalgia that swept over me, then, when I finally found this bakeshop situated near the food court in Arizona Mills.The shop looked so pretty- all lit up and all these enticing baked goods wrapped in plastic/cellophane with candy-red printing.  (Hmm... an alarm went off in my head after seeing them all wrapped up.)  The shop looked very clean, with welcoming tables and chairs, and my, how lovely those cake rolls look in the case!  Imagine, then, my disappointment upon reading the nutrition info on these plastic-wrapped goods to find that most, if not all, items are made with margarine, not butter.  These baked goods failed the "farm vs. factory" test- ingredients listed sound more like they're mechanically-produced in a factory rather than being all-natural, such as "flour, eggs, butter, milk," etc.  Before sampling what I must admit was a delicious morsel of mocha crunch cake, I asked if the frosting contained powdered sugar.  The sales clerk looked at his coworker, whom I assumed is a manager, who looked at him, then looked at me, and then said "We think it's whipped cream."  Think??  How can you not know what ingredients are used in the products you sell?  I also inquired if any items are made on-site.  No, he said.  Everything is shipped/trucked in, and the only preparations done at the bakeshop are the frying- the FRYING- of the empanadas and the re-heating of the siopao and noodle dishes.  Sorry Red Ribbon, but this Filipina only wants goods baked with butter, not margarine.  I said BAKED, not fried.  With the exception of the pie shell used in the egg pie, all of the pastries served at Manila Bakery are made on-site, so you won't find preservatives listed in the ingredients, as well.  My fond memories of those cakes will have to be just that, memories.  All the better when it comes to those twice-daily weigh-ins...

Restaurant name  Teriyaki Madness
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
This place is decent if you want that teriyaki fix. I usually get the two item combination plate. Its your choice of any two meats. Comes with steamed rice and salad. I usually get brown rice instead of white and macaroni salad instead of their basic house salad.I paid a total of 10.53 for this meal. That doesn't include drinks. You would think that paying 10 bucks for lunch would get you somewhat of nice size portion but I finished my meal with no problem. I think they don't give you enough meat and the rice was like two small scoops. They also charge you extra for brown rice. Dont get me wrong. The food is good but the portions and the price gets two stars subtracted. Also a couple times my coworkers got food poisoning after eating here for dinner. They were up at 4 in the morning hanging out in the bathroom. Im surprised I havnt got sick yet for I have eaten here several times. I think sometimes they cook the meats too fast and not cook it long enough. Service is ok and the overall size of the place is pretty good to handle the lunch and dinner crowds. They are kind of tucked away in a plaza just off the 215 and Stephanie exit. So overall, If I can just get a little more food for the price I pay that would make things perfect. Either that or lower the price a bit because spending 10 bucks for lunch a day is considered a luxury for some people.Madness in a bowl!This location is nearby on the corner of Stephanie and Paseo Verde.  Since it's in the same parking lot as Eos Gym, there were many gym goers stopping in. The dining area is clean.  Not a very large area with tables but it seemed there were a lot of carry out orders so it was fine.  Service was fine- orders were correct and made in a reasonable amount of time.  I have been on a tofu kick so I wanted to try their Tofu Bowl.  I chose brown rice and vegetables to be included.  The bowl is plenty for me.  There was a good amount of tofu as well as fillers.  It was actually pretty decent.  I wouldn't mind ordering it again when I'm in the tofu mood.  For a quick and easy meal, Teriyaki Madness is good for me.

Restaurant name  Dragon House Chinese Buffet
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
Sure, you can find places in Charlotte that have cook-to-order food along with a buffet (think Chen's Bistro or China One).  Unfortunately those places lack something - usually you can't communicate with the chef, or if you do, the chef mixes your order with someone else's, or you can't add the meat yourself.  Something is always missing.  Not at Dragon House.Don't get me wrong - this isn't strictly Mongolian BBQ - but it's awfully close.  You get a buffet line dedicated solely to the BBQ line, with a number of veggies and lo mein.  You get chicken, beef, shrimp, (possibly imitation) crab and something that appeared to be a sort of seafood.  You get at least a half-dozen sauces.  Throw whatever you want in a bowl, put it in the queue, and come back a few minutes later and it'll be piping hot, ready for you to eat.  Sweet!To make things even better, there are three lines of regular buffet fare to keep you busy while you wait, and a fourth line that holds a few sushi items and desserts - even a soft-serve ice cream machine.The buffet food isn't the best I've had, but it's far from the worst.  You'll find bite-sized appetizers (the dumplings are good) and typical entrees too (the coconut shrimp was my favorite), but it's the BBQ that I enjoyed the most.  Since BD's shut down a few years ago, it's what I've been craving, and now it's back.  If you don't want the pressure, the buffet is quite decent, and the price isn't bad either.  Service is good, but beware that you might see a line at busy times of the day.

Review Text :
So you won't believe how I ended up here. Somehow I had it in my head that the Wild Wild West was the hidden gem of Vegas buffets. Well, when Jamie W. and I drove there, we discovered that it was a tired motel filled with frog-voiced smokers next to a Denny's. Surely my mind was playing tricks on me. As I realized much later, it was Sam's Town I was looking for, but regardless, we were jonesing for breakfast. Thanks to the trusty Yelp app on my iPhone, we zeroed in on WaffleS Cafe. Surprise, surprise...it's in a strip mall just like almost every non-Strip eatery in town. It really looks like a smoothie shop since I couldn't tell if they even had a kitchen. The overhead menu would have you believe it's a virtual waffle-palooza in there. Perhaps but I didn't hear the sound of a griddle or the plop of the batter, which made me think the waffles are made elsewhere and heated up in the back. It was just too quiet in there. Anyhow, both of us went for the $5.49 Breakfast Special - which consisted of a large, round waffle; a couple of eggs; bacon or sausage; and a cup of coffee. I ordered the pumpkin waffle and had blueberries and whipped cream placed on top. It was good, and the meaty sausage and scrambled eggs helped a lot. Jamie showed greater forbearance and had his pumpkin waffle plain with a pat of butter, but he weakened and went for the bacon. All in all, it didn't feel substantive enough to be the breakfast we desired, but it did tie us over until the dogs we had at Pink's for lunch. Not because of the server, who was quite nice and cheery, but I doubt if I'll be back simply because it is slipping from my memory as I write this. FOOD - 3 stars...nice large Belgian-style waffles but the oomph factor seemed missing AMBIANCE - 3 stars...surely they sell Jamba Juice here, don't they? SERVICE - 4 stars...peppy and responsive TOTAL - 3 stars...just not quite memorable enough for me to return for a waffle

Restaurant name  Cafe Monarch
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
Guess I'm the first... brace yourself.... I'm feelin chatty.Café Monarch is exactly what we've been looking for in Old Town. I don't know if there is a term for what this place is... kinda bistro, kinda café, kinda semi-private dining room: a castro privé? a bafé? Whatever it is, it feels like home.THE PLACEThe Monarch resides in a small, charming building with its own lot. The style is rustic, cozy and clean modern at the same time. A well-equipped, open chef's kitchen greets you on the left as you enter. There are a few tables inside, tucked into niches. There is one very clean and beautifully done bathroom. The design/decor is impeccable and creative. You can tell how much thought and detail went into the space. There is nothing about it that says "turn-key restaurant operation". And best of all this time of year, a fantastic patio, candle-lit, dark and surrounded by great plantings. There is no way I would refuse the patio, unless soft-ball sized hail was in the forecast.HOW IT WORKS (based on our first visit)We had some idea what to expect: the place is an extension of the man, the chef/owner - Chris. Whatever he has decided to purchase, is what's for dinner. Just an oral menu. He tells you what he's got on hand and runs it past you. I expect, if you had some special needs, or even objections, he could easily offer up alternatives. Everything sounded great to everyone in our party, so he just started bringing stuff out at a leisurely pace. L-e-i-s-u-r-e-l-y. Which was exactly what we wanted. We were in no rush. You shouldn't be for an experience like this. The pace is like a large family meal in Europe. Prepare to relax and enjoy each course on its own.An important note: it's BYOB for wine&beer, which we love. If you know what you like to drink, BYOB is a joy. There are numerous wine shops near Old Town to grab something on the way.THE FOODIt was excellent. Everything fresh. Hearty, layered flavors. Generous portions. Expertly prepared, but with the welcome rough edges of a gourmet meal at someone's home. Although I guess it varies daily, here is roughly what we had: - a hummus salad(?) loaded with good stuff served with hearty, crunchy hearth crackers. - warm, baked goat cheese surrounded by sauteed grapes(!) and greens with rustic bruschetta, crunchy on the outside and chewy in the middle. - some sort of chunky beef soup, with mediterranean/moroccon tones - a meal in itself. - a GIANT rack of grilled lamb. giant. seems like colorado lamb, due to the size of the ribs and the tenderloin and the pleasant gaminess. 6 huge chops. nicely balanced between sweet and savory, not some horrible overpowering chutney. personally, i like a more herby, garlic, salty approach with no sauce. but it was awesome. - dessert? maybe? i was way into the wine by then. i always skip dessert. i think gelatos and strawberries.IS IT FOR YOU?Hopefully! But I could see how Café Monarch is not for everyone. If you're generally fussy, or antsy or uncomfortable if you're not being ushered from activity to activity, stay away. If you are excessively picky and have trouble finding something you like even on a large menu, stay away. If you like Olive Garden pasta, are sad about losing Bennigan's or if french fries are your favorite French food, stay away. Although I bet he makes some bitchen french fries.I hope for your sake, it's for you. But if it doesn't sound like your type of experience, I wouldn't try to force yourself into it. There's an Outback nearby that's got a beeper with your name on it.IMPORTANT NOTES - do not come for "a quick bite" - this will be your evening (or your morning i guess). - again, BYOB. bring plenty.  - currently, there is lunch service on weekdays, and breakfast/brunch on weekends, dinner is only Friday & Saturday. not sure if there is a closed day. - no cheesecake factory menu of 1000s here, you're eating what Chris is making. - call ahead, or you may arrive to be greeted by a "Sorry, we're off catering!" sign.I'll be back, and update as needed!Wow. Did brunch today, as opposed to dinner from the previous review.Outstanding. 3 little waffles with fresh berries and a lemon-pistachio butter(?). Best waffles I've ever had. Light and crispy on the outside. And not just "fluffy" on the inside. More unique - almost like a popover texture in the middle. Not overly sweet, just the crispy, moist waffles with natural sweetness from the berries and a handmade syrup from fruit.Then a whole nother course: scrambled eggs on top of melting gouda, next to toast with pesto and artichoke hearts, bacon and chicken breast stuffed with sausage.Either one of these courses could have been my whole brunch. But I couldn't resist eating both. Thank god we rode bikes there and back, and then rode again later to dinner with friends in the hood.And great news! Smokehouse Sunday is theoretically starting next Sunday at 11am. (for future reference: this review is from Oct 2008)Cafe Monarch is romantic, quaint, charming, and quirky...a nice change of place and pace in Scottsdale. The chef, Chris, cooks with love and artistry from the moment he greets you to the moment he serves you. My salmon dish was prepared perfectly (I told him I wanted something healthy) with a blend of mixed vegetables. It just wasn't the meal itself that was good, but the presentation and portion of my meal. Too bad I didn't have my camera with me, but it was beautiful. He then surprised me with a small slice of bread pudding for dessert soaked in (vanilla?) cream sauce. Is he a mind reader, too? Bread pudding is one of my favorite desserts.The one thing that makes this place so unique is that there's only one chef and maybe another server to help him out. Remember, patience is a virtue. Don't expect a large menu, though, because there isn't one. Simply displayed on a chalkboard are a few items you can choose from for lunch. I will definitely be back to enjoy his brunch.Oh! And for those of you not in the know. I love (addicted) to coffee and I kid you not...my coffee mug was never empty. Chris kept that baby and my caffeine levels loaded. Maybe I should marry this guy?Another dinner to leave me slouched back in my chair with my hand on my belly, a stupid grin on my face and a contented sigh on my lips.  I brought Ada G., Elaine B. (formally known as P - I kind of like her "formally known as P) and B here for dinner on Thursday night as I've been talking about it for so long, they wanted to know what all the hubbub was about since I couldn't stop talking about the roll-your-eyes-back-in-your-head brunch I had here last Spring so we finally made reservations and off we went.When you make reservations at Cafe Monarch, you want to let Christopher know if you have any food aversions or allergies, or maybe even if you're really counting on something in particular that night so he can plan in advance.  He shops for the freshest produce and selections for the night are restricted.  That being said, I wish more places did it this way.  It's tiring to flip through pages and pages of menus of nearly identical items.  I'd just as soon be told the chef bought the freshest items possible that day and this is what inspired him or her and this is what will be served tonight.  Will this suffice?  Why yes, yes it does!  Thank you.  Do you understand my point?We brought along a couple of bottle of champagne and a white and red.  It's all BYO here and we figured we'd hedge our bets not knowing what we'd be in the mood for.  (By the way, it's also cash or check also - no credit cards) We started with some champagne and Christopher told us for dinner he had in mind a penne pasta with a pumpkin cream sauce, toasted walnuts and sliced Gorgonzola on top.   For the next course we would have a warm salad of fresh artichokes, olives and peppers and for the main course was a beer braised chicken.  All of it sounded fabulous to us, of course none of are picky eaters.  Isn't it just more fun to dine with good eaters?  Pretty much anything he would have made, we would have ate.  No food aversions at our table!  (Innards.  I take that back.  I don't like innards.)We enjoyed our champagne while he worked on the pasta.  The smells coming from the kitchen were just intoxicating.  The restaurant itself is so cozy too.  We sat inside this time and the best I can describe it is a cross between a French bistro and Buca di Beppo.  OK.  Total disservice to Cafe Monarch but he has the coolest things all over his walls like Buca di Beppo does.  As for the rest, I could swear I was back in a cafe in Paris.  Our pasta came out heaped on a platter family style.  The sauce was a lovely pale pumpkin hue accented with fresh herbs and lovely, pungent slices of Gorgonzola and crunchy walnuts it was pitch perfect.  We all ate as much as we dared while Christopher came and entertained us with his stories.  In most restaurants when the owner or manager comes by to see if everything is OK that's all fine and dandy but you usually don't want them hanging around spouting their propaganda, but with Chris it's the complete opposite.  You don't want him to go!  You wish you could eat with him every night.  He told us about growing up, what he did last summer, he joked around with us girls, commented on Ada G's. cowgirl sheik attire (I'll let her go into that) and even explained to me exactly how he made a couple of the dishes.The warm salad served next came in a small, cast iron skillet.  Baby sliced artichokes were sautéed with capers, sweet Italian peppers, heirloom tomatoes and thyme.  It was light, flavorful and a welcome departure to the typical green salad I've been eating all summer.Our final course was fit for a small village.  A platter of chicken pieces all beautifully browned and braised in Full Sail Ale.  The braising sauce was exquisite spooned over the spicy chicken meat.  The cute, little, pregnant one of us who claims she can't eat much anymore even ate two pieces of the chicken.  You've got to love Christopher, he boxed up all of the leftover pasta and chicken for us into individual boxes.Right when we thought the best was over he brings over a couple of slices of pumpkin cheesecake with walnut brittle.  I like cheesecake but it's usually something I wouldn't order because it's so heavy but not this one!  Light and creamy, like a baked pumpkin cheesecake chiffon.  The perfect sweet ending to a beautiful meal.Though I want everyone out there to go to Cafe Monarch because I think it's one of the best restaurants around, I don't think it's for everyone.  Of course you can tell him your allergies and aversions when you call to make reservations and allergies can't be helped of course and who doesn't have an aversion to something or other but meals like this are best when you leave it in the chef's hands.  Relinquish the control you think you need and let him decide what to prepare for you and I guarantee that you too will be slouched back in your chair rubbing your full belly and a contented sigh on your lips.I walked into Cafe Monarch and knew instantly how my dream kitchen would look, how my dream restaurant would be laid out and how my dream clientele would be. We had called in advance to see if Chris could prepare a vegan meal, a request he gladly obliged, and we were welcomed warmly in various ways: 1) A lovely greeting from Chris, excited to meet the vegan with additional questions about how food can be prepared, 2) prompt opening of our bottle of red to get us started, 3) a cozy seat by the fire outside while he prepared appetizers.The food was fresh and delicious, though I think he may have been timid and slightly insecure about not being able to cover anything on my plate with cheese. After an hour long post-dinner chat about vegan cooking secrets, he was (dare I say) excited about the idea of trying something completely new in the kitchen. So regardless of the food, which sounds odd because that's the main component of many of our reviews here, his contagiously friendly personality, openness and fervor for food were worth many more stars than this rating system will allow. Bravo and I can't wait to go again.Even though I didn't get a chance to eat here on my recent trip, Chris earned me as a fan when I stopped by. We'd just checked out of the Valley Ho and were heading to the Fairmont when I noticed the sign for Cafe Monarch. Having read all the great reviews, we pulled into the parking lot so I could jump out and make reservations for later in our stay.I instantly liked the look of the place: cute, cozy little house with some porch seating. But I was still taken aback when I walked in and realized the main room was seating and open kitchen combined--in a very small space. Chris, partially hidden behind kitchen racks, greeted me right away even though he was clearly busy. I explained that I wished to make reservations for a friend's birthday on Monday. He said they're closed Monday through Wednesday (the remainder of our time in town), as he plated some amazing-looking salmon on a bed of greens. I think I looked really sad (mostly because I just wanted to grab one of those plates of salmon and dig in), so he said he was really sorry but he hoped we'd come back when next in Scottsdale.You know I will, Chris. I'm just worried that it will be even harder to get a table next time! ;)Note: I also asked for a menu to take with me, but Chris explained that there's never a set menu since he changes it daily, depending on which fresh ingredients he can source.QUESTION: If you're in Arizona and can only do one thing, which do you choose:(a) Gaze upon the Grand Canyon.(b) Hike the trails of Sedona.(c) Tour Kartchner Caverns(d) Dine at Café MonarchBelieve it or not, the answer is (d) and here's why.  The hole in the ground, the red rocks and the bat-cave have all been around for thousands of years, and will continue to be around for many lifetimes. You can see them anytime and they're not going anywhere.  Now we are all traveling mortals, placed on this earth for a finite time.  You, me, and Chris (the chef at Café Monarch) are no exception.  Now I wish all of us, including Chris (the waiter at Café Monarch) a long and prosperous life.  But lets face it; none of us know what our Creator has in store for us, and that includes Chris (the host at Café Monarch).  Also, we never know when the landlord is going to sell our shop's location to turn it into a Wal-Mart, and this goes for the place leased by Chris (the busboy at Café Monarch).  Finally, we never know where we're going to be in a few years.  For example, we could fall in love with someone special and move back to New York City and this includes Chris (the dishwasher at Café Monarch).Let me put it to you another way... If Michelangelo painted the Sistine Chapel in disappearing ink, wouldn't you rush off to see it?  Some works of art or natural beauty will last forever.  But when food is art it must be experienced (i.e. eaten) hot off the grill and whenever you can get it.  So when the medium of the 'genius-artist' is food, you have to grab every opportunity to experience the masterpiece.  Chris brings a passion to his cooking.  He tells us that cooking became a necessity as a child, but it was also his chosen form of creative outlet.  He has developed an intuitive ability to combine flavors, spices and textures.  He provides beautiful presentations that are layered with tastes... you and your pals will be guessing at the ingredients.  This "artwork" is tasty, healthy and generously portioned.  All for about 40 bucks plus a $10 corking fee.  Arizona is lucky to have Chris feeding a few selected diners who are smart enough to make reservations.  Go see (and eat) this man's art.This is a must see, must do restaurant in Old Town Scottsdale.  If there was one restaurant I'd recommend in the entire Phoenix metro for a great meal/experience this would be at the top of the list.  Cafe Monarch is great and sure has found a niche that it thrives well in.  Very out of the ordinary with the owner holding the duties of chef/hostess/busser/and server, but he sure does it well. Having a very limited menu posted near the front door proudly tells what the chef wants to serve his patrons for that day. There's only two to three items listed with little description.  I was a little confused myself as I like to understand and take control of things, but I soon realized this was something to let the creator(the chef) to have his way with.   His creations come with enormous skill glorifying fresh ingredients into a dish that can appeal to anyone's palette.  I've enjoyed salads with salmon and chicken the times I have visited, but who knows what will be on the menu on my next visit.  Whatever it is, I will must certainly try it! Two final matters, bring cash as the owner doesn't like give up the 3-5% the credit card companies like to charge for convenience of the American consumer.  Lastly, you will have to wait until September to enjoy this place as it is closed for the summer.Cafe Monarch is everything the five star reviews make it out to be and more. It's a must try for a unique brunch/lunch/dinner/whatever experience in the valley! I'm reluctant to review this place since I don't want to wade through patrons on my way to another lovely Sunday brunch, but my taste buds will not be deterred. (Plus I have until September before they re-open, so there's plenty of buffer room.)It's an impromptu fly-by-the-seat-of-whatever-the-chef-feels-like-whipping-up type place. The kind of place where you show up to breakfast and are asked one question: Sweet or savory? So whatever you do, leave those picky eater at home! When it comes to dinner, you don't want a wonderbread palate ("Um, I don't eat anything green...") influencing the meal. Chef Christopher is a dynamo in the kitchen, and you need to leave that one man show plenty of room to create his masterpieces. No exaggeration, his dishes are crazy delicious masterpieces. It's like having your own personal top chef customizing something just for you.The fact that this place is BYOB makes my heart smile. I love sharing a couple bottles of good wine or champagne among friends over dinner, and the fact that I don't have to pay a restaurant mark-up is ideal. He's also cool with you brining in some orange or cranberry juice for  DIY mimosas in the morning. There's a $10 corking fee, but considering the fact that a glass of wine is often more expensive than that, it's a screaming deal. Be forewarned that this is a dining experience rather than a quicky meal. A much more European approach to lingering and enjoying the food, drink and atmosphere. It will take you a couple hours to get through everything from initial seat and greet with the chef (who doubles as the waiter/busser/todos!) to your last scrumptious bite. Totally worth every minute of waiting. Also, you might not want to come here starvin marvin. And definitely don't invite anyone you can't stomach hanging out with for a couple hours. Let's wrap it up:-Don't bring picky eaters.-Don't come so hungry that you'd eat the ass end carpaccio out of fresh roadkill.-Don't bring socially awkward schmoes that will suck all the fun out of the room because you've got to be around that for hours, man. Hours.-Do BYOB, and don't be afraid to bring a mixer for mimosa fun.-Do bring cash only, and tip very, very well. (He deserves it!)I now set you forth upon the world with the knowledge necessary to enjoy all that Cafe Monarch has to offer. Use it wisely.Welcome to another secret garden of Old Town Scottsdale. Are you wondering where Cafe Monarch is located? Well, it's hidden in the most delightful way and I wouldn't want it to be any other way. But if you really want to find it (and I don't know if I want to give the secret away), I will say that it's located just south of Indian School off of Goldwater. When a restaurant has a five star average and nearly 60 reviews, they've got to be doing something right. Cafe Monarch is no exception. After months of anticipation, Cafe Monarch finally reopened its doors after a summer hiatus and I couldn't wait to give it a try. Through yelp reviews, I heard that you come prepared to eat what the chef feels like making that day. Yelp friends, don't question the chef. He knows what he's doing. He knows what you want more than you yourself know what you want. I began my meal with a freshly made hibiscus iced tea. It was the perfect refreshment to enjoy the warm weather on the adorable patio surrounding the restaurant. Since this is BYOB, the chef mentioned that this iced tea is also quite tasty with some vodka in it, but since I had a long day ahead of me, I went the alchi-free route this time. Possibly dinner next time? The menu had a variety of items to choose from including a chicken pesto sandwich or salad and a prosciutto panini. I went for the chicken pesto sandwich after the chef said it was his favorite (and remember, don't question the chef's choices) and I couldn't have been more pleased. The chicken was roasted to perfection and moist with freshly made cheesy pesto giving it a hug. Situated on a freshly made french baguette, it was a treat to put in my mouth and I secretly didn't want the cuisine experience to end! To accompany the sandwich, the chef made a salad full of fresh cantaloupe, grapes and strawberries. I assume he makes salads based on the season and I was very happy the fruit season was upon us! The meal was perfect. It was light and satisfying in a perfectly peaceful setting. The house is adorable and I wish my own could resemble it. I think this could quite possibly be one of the perfect locations to dine on a lazy afternoon when I don't have a care in the world (or want to pretend that I don't). And before I go, I wanted to mention how nice the chef/owner is! He's very personable with his customers and makes each experience unique and delightful. I believe that delightful is absolutely the overall word to describe my experience at Cafe Monarch. Some things to note before you visit:- Cash only, so come prepared. I had an iced tea and sandwich with a salad and it was around $16. - BYOB and if you forget, there's a Circle K just next door to buy some "quality" booze - Be prepared to relax and enjoy yourself. For being a one man show, the chef/owner does an excellent job of preparing a delicacy in a short period of time, but the atmosphere is so adorable you should plan on staying to enjoy it while you're there.Shortly after I wrote my 3 star review, Christopher contacted me. He was very apologetic about our experience and wished that we had enjoyed our meal more.  He immediately offered to refund us the cost of the meal because we weren't 100% satisfied.After discussing his offer with my friends, we decided to take a 50% refund.  Let me just say that I was personally a little uncomfortable with this because while I have received refund/free meal offers from other businesses in the past, I've never taken them up on it.  I don't think it's about the money and I certainly don't write reviews to elicit free meals.  However, since the 3 of us split the cost of the meal evenly, I felt that it would only be fair if I took my friends' suggestions into account. Anyway, the refund check arrived in the mail yesterday.  I decided to upgrade my review to 4 stars given the overall experience.  It's rare to find business owners who value their customers as much as Christopher.Yes yes yes, for every reason all the 5 star reviews state below!  Multiple trips to wine country with more than my (small) wine fridge will hold, this is exactly the place I want to crack these bottles open and let the atmosphere and food wash over me.  Hey...though I love to cook at home, I admit my meals do not justify these bottles' price tags. :P  So bring your beautiful wine and enjoy the evening away...  actually bring 2-3 bottles and decide what you are going to pour once you hear the menu  ;)PS.  Just talking to Chris on the phone, he has more personality than some folks exhibit their entire lives!First off, I feel bad giving this place just three stars. After reading all the reviews, I was really hoping to like it a lot more than I did. I've heard for months from friends and fellow yelpers about how awesome this place is, so we decided to give it a try for early Vday dinner. The atmosphere is very very nice. Nice little cottage with a kitchen (where they have a few tables next to the chef), a dining area, and an outside patio area. There are lots of candles and can be romantic place. The waiters were all nice, but we had some issues with the service. A group of 4 that came 20mins later than us(just 2) sat next to our table and kept getting food quicker than us. The most annoying part was that the waiters kept telling us our food would come, but the speed and service was definitely lacking. As for the food, it was definitely worth 3+ stars except for the main chicken pesto dish. It was just two butterflied chicken pieces with pesto sauce, no vegetables, no special sauce, nothing special. I did love the appetizer 1 (white bean soup with side of bread with asiago cheese), appetizer 2 (barley and poached shrimp w/ sweet asian chili sauce), and one of the main dishes (pork tenderloin with a sweet chutney/hint of curry sauce and asparagus). The dessert was just some strawberries and fudge brownie. Again, nothing special.All in all, I did like the experience, but the food left me thinking there could have been more or that it could have been better. Maybe I went in thinking too highly of this place. I am willing to give it another try, but it's not #1 that I would recommend to a friend.** I wanted to add something. Chris, the owner of the restaurant sent me an apology via email and phone call. This says a lot considering chefs will get very offended if you talk remotely bad about their food/creations. I have to admit. I feel bad if I seem very cruel in my review, but I feel that I was not over-exaggerating anything. I like to think that I speak the truth and hopefully readers can appreciate that. One last thing.. Chris pointed out to me that the chicken pesto had provolone cheese and spinach. I am sorry Chris, I have a dull palate. Again, i would like to try cafe monarch again and will update on my next visit!My goodness! Where are these reviews coming from?? A PR company? I've seen such positive press on this restaurant that when my husband tried to make a reservation and they told him that we needed to wait 3 weeks and  bring two friends since they only had a four top I was still excited to go. Disappointed. One, you pay a cork fee for your wine but the waiters are nowhere to be found to pour it. Not ONCE. Two, the decor was sterile at best. It was like modern looking office depot desks placed in a warehouse in some parts and then fake pine needles and mirrors in another. Kind of 'off'. Maybe they need to consult a decorator. Three, although we were told to bring two people since there were no two tops, there were 2 of them just in our little room alone not even including the front area. FOOD: You had no choice of appetizers or desert. One choice.  For the entree you got to choose between fish and meat but when we ordered the meat they didn't even ask how we liked it cooked. It was all average. AND, the reviews all tout how involved the owner is in choosing the meals but we saw no hide or hair of him until we were in the parking lot ready to leave.  Small asides: I asked for black napkins. They had them but they were wet. Yup. Wet. And when we decided to take a doggy bag (yes, for the dog) they handed us a cardboard box and told us to have at it. DISAPPOINTED. We will never ever ever ever ever go back again. The food was OK but nothing to brag about. Considering they only have FOUR dishes in the whole restaurant I expected to be wowed. Not so.Don't waste an evening out or your hard earned cash on this place. And I mean cash literally. They don't take credit cards.I am surprised at all the 5 star reviews.  Café Monarch is mediocre for the expense.My boyfriend surprised me for my 40th birthday with a dinner at Café Monarch.  We were impressed with the restaurant concept, high end, delectable fare, operated as a one-man show.  The starter white bean soup was bland and the main meal was very, very spicy.  It took about 3 hours to get through only three courses; it was BYOB unfortunately the owner/chef charged us a corking fee. We were not able to choose what we wanted for dinner, we only noted any food allergies we may have had and the chef prepared surprise spicy beef dishes.When making the reservation, the owner/chef/waiter offered to make a special birthday treat and asked my boyfriend what my favorite dessert was.  He told him that I love cupcakes and Chef said he would make them for us.  At the end of our meal, he informed us that he had sold all of my cupcakes.  That was absolutely, positively, 100% unacceptable.I do understand why it took so long to prepare and serve the meals, but just that he sold out all of my birthday cupcakes, not even just saving one for the birthday girl, was disappointing.Unfortunately, I will not visit Café Monarch again.So, somehow, I had never heard of this place. I can't even recall how I stumbled onto it. Probably when Googling something like, "top places in Arizona that make you feel like you're dining in the movie 'The Secret Garden'". Or something like that.This place is spec.tac.u.lar (said like Kevin Spacey from American Beauty).My friend and I just kinda went on a whim on a Thursday night, not knowing what to expect. I didn't realize the menu was prix fixe, but the hostess quickly filled us in on the details - $45 for a 3-course meal. Salad, entree, and dessert. Fine by us. We were greeted by extremely friendly staff and a delightful little patio, lit up by soft lighting and actual candles. Not that fake fire plastic cheesy bullshit. We were seated by a little fountain at a small table with a chair on one end, and then a 2-person couch on the other. Clearly meant for some type of romantic snuggling. A few minutes later, the owner, Christian, came by to chat with us a bit about the history of the place. He was very friendly and sincere.Our server took our beverage orders and I said something along the lines of, "I dunno, gimme something fruity. No cucumbers". He brought back something perfect for both of us, and they were SKRONG drinks. I was already giggling like a schoolgirl. Luckily, the eggplant salad came out quickly after to soak up some of that alcohol. It was super unique; filled with diced tomatoes, olives, chunks of eggplant and a bunch of other tasty stuff neatly placed on a bed of greens. Oh, I should mention, their menu changes daily, so you get something unique every time you go. Not sure if it changes for lunch/brunch, but for dinner it does. The salad and dessert are the same, but you have 2 choices for entrees. It makes ordering very simple. My friend had the short ribs and I had the shrimp polenta. Our entrees followed quickly after the salad, both looking and tasting delightful. I honestly don't know what the Hell polenta is, but it was yummy. Everything was so fresh and simple, and being a bit of a cheap, uncultured person, I appreciate things that are simple. I had a bite of the short ribs as well - tender AF. Lastly, our desert came out. Simple as well. Just a lovely brownie with some ice cream and wait...HOD UP. Is this brownie toffee!?? Yes, it was a toffee brownie. I tried to be polite and take adorable girly bites, but fuck it. I ate that thing in like 5 seconds. Afterward, the chef himself stopped by to get our feedback on the food. He was a character. Funny, friendly guy who unfortunately told us he was moving back to San Diego in a month. But I'm sure whoever replaces him will be just as badass. I would expect nothing less at this point.So after 2 drinks and a 3-course meal, I'd say yeah. We were pretty satisfied. Our bill came to about $120 total. Not what we had intended on spending, but certainly worth every penny. This place is really great for a romantic evening, a special occasion, and definitely a wedding. I haven't been for brunch or lunch yet, they've been booked up the past couple of Sundays sadly. But I can't wait to try it and write a novel on how I feel about it for your reading pleasure.You're welcome.What a wonderful experience for me.  I had planned all winter to visit this resto.  My friend and I kept trying to set a date that would work in Mar/Apr this year.  With it being the high season here in AZ, we had to book about 4 weeks in advance to get a decent seating time on a weekend night.  So, we booked our date.  A week out, my friend has a family situation that came up and could not make it.  Well, I waited all that time (not including the time it finally took for us to settle on a date) I sure as hell wasn't going to cancel the dinner JUST because my friend could not go.  Ok, so this is definitely not the type of place one would expect to see a woman sitting along eating dinner.  NO WAY.  This place has the most romantic, quiet and beautiful patio dining room.  With it being April, the patio dining room was in full effect and in walks ... ME.. solo.  Dressed to the nines in my 5 inch heels and dress and etc as if I were meeting someone.. Nope... table for 1.I am seated right away and this is when I began to really sit back and enjoy myself.  Every person that came to my table called me by name, Ms D, can I get you some more Tea?  Ms D, how was the this and Ms D, can we get you a that?  Oh man, all that fuss over me made me feel like a true princess.  Chef Chris even came by twice and commented that he was happy I had decided to come anyway.  I was too.My meal was very good.  A week or so before the dinner, Chef Chris personally called me to ask what types of foods we didn't like and what we liked.  I said Chilean sea bass is my favorite fish and I generally enjoy fish.  I forgot to mention that the only thing I really HATE is fennel and caraway seeds - like PLEASE DO NOT PUT THAT IN MY DISHES.  How I manged to forget that important detail is beyond me!  So its the dinner night....   On my drive to dinner, I remember thinking to myself, how could I forget that i HATE fennel and caraway seeds.  I thought, what are the chances that he would have fennel or caraway seeds in the dish?  I shrugged it off and thought, "naaaah".  Get to dinner and discover they had Chilean Seabass (Yeaaa!) with, you guessed it, blanched fennel and etc.  My heart sank because I don't really eat beef, which was the other option.  so, I ordered the Chilean Sea Bass.  I figured I could possibly remove anything with fennel in it and just eat the fish.  To my surprise, the fish comes out and, you guessed it, I LOVED it.  Fennel and all.  I was shocked.  I ate EVERY bite of that fish.  Chef Chris told me that blanching fennel calms down the flavor and he was right.  It was actually extremely pleasant.  Any place that can make me like fennel and cause me to start cooking the fennel in my CSA basket at home deserves a minimum 4 stars.  They get a bonus star for the stellar service.I think I will return for a b'day dinner... alone in the next couple of weeks.  I'm due for some food pampering.  Bravo Chef Chris and staff!Wow!  Just wow!  Totally and utterly overrated.  I really wanted to believe the hype and hysteria.  I really did. My best friend and I went there last week.  The menu was melon soup with lime sorbet, heirloom tomato and cheese salad, and either ribeye or curried fish.  First the atmosphere is fantastic, really quaint and romantic. The servers were well meaning too.  First course: the amuse Bouche soup. It was about two table spoons of melon smoothie that anyone with a Vitamix can make.  Oh but it had a dollop of lime sorbet on top and a colorful swirl of who cares.  It was like getting dessert as appetizer but much less satisfying.Second course: the heirloom tomato and super sprout phenomenon salad.  It had three  one quarter inch thick half moon slices of tomatos, three pieces of cheese and three quarters of a pound of sprouts of some über micro green.  But to be fair it did have a shmear of some paste on the plate.  Basically tasteless, tomatoes were less than ripe and still very hard.   Really 55.00 for three slices of tomatoe, cheese and a handful of greens? Call me crazy but the value for a a foodie for food that tastes like my kindergartner made it is just not there.  Fail number two.  Third course entree:  I had the "ribeye" and my friend had the curried fish.  The ribeye was unlike any ribeye I've had.  It frankly wasn't ribeye.  It was three medallions of lean beef over black lentils and drizzled with who cares wine reduction.  Again very lacking on flavor, contrast, and flavor.  But seriously folks who doesn't love a bite of top round with a deliciously bland mouthful of lentils to deaden all your taste buds?  Oh and before I forget, after we ordered my friend noted to me they didn't ask how you wanted your steak cooked.  So the next time the server came 'round we asked why and said I want it rare.  The server (who I think is in training bc he seemed to have to ask the other server everything - which is fine better sad than sorry there's a sometimes steep learning curve in fine dining) said, "the steak is cooked medium rare the way the chef wants it."  Now I haven't worked with Gordon Ramsey but I bet you a million dollars that he'd ask the patron for his opinion on the matter.  That said I still really think he was in training and forgot to ask and didn't want to go back to the kitchen and get yelled at for not asking etc.  Been there myself.  Fine medium rare will do just fine - the chef said so.  My friend's curried fish (I totally forgot what type of fish but I think it was mahi mahi) was the best dish of the night.  But it too was not that impressive.   I think I would rather hit malees for fish in curry sauce.  And again it had some lentil bland mound under the fish.  The final course was dessert.  We ordered two Lagavulin 16s on the rocks (it took a minute because the server had to ask the lead server to talk to is about scotch options) to go with the...oh wait the dessert was so unmemorable I forgot what it was.  I literally can't remember what it was.  But I do remember being unimpressed and saying to my friend the first course soup would've been a better dessert.  Lastly the bill.  The night before we ate at Mastro's In Scottsdale and had  a much much better bill to food ratio.  And I am a ravenous foodie and I understand small courses and I Know it's not a steak house.  My point here is that at the most expensive steakhouse in Scottsdale where the ribeye is 70 dollars or so and you know you are being plundered for meat you could buy at AJs and grill or put in your salamander you are still getting tastier food and more bang for your buck.  Or likewise if you went to Binkleys in cave creek your money would be So much better spent.  Food doesn't get masked and duct taped with lentils there.  And you could do 3 or 5 or 7 courses or just order off the menu AND Chef Binkley will take the time to ask if there is any special accommodations for allergies, taste profiles etc that he needs to change or modify for you.  Oh and it tastes amazing so you get your money's worth.  At cafe monarch (where the chef is king) they must be doing summer budget cuts and dialing the food down a notch as the snow birds leave and the locals get the table scraps, or maybe it was an off night, or maybe they just serve food that way I don't know but frankly it sucked.  TOTALLY AND UTTERLY OVERRATED AND UNIMPRESSIVE!  Oh and the ice cubes for our scotch cost $2.00 each.  That's right two dollars for frozen water put into a rocks glass.  Seriously, the budget must be really out of balance.I had to come up with some place special for my wife's 30th birthday this week. Wanted it to be somewhere romantic with amazing food. Enter Cafe Monarch. Arrived for our reservation at 8:30. Taken straight back to our cozy little spot by the fountain on the patio. This place is beautiful. The lighting and ambiance in the back on the patio made me totally forget that merely hours earlier I was cursing at the sun and wondering if I would ever be able to hydrate again. The misters were on and it felt perfect (it hit 109 degrees today).Our waiter came out quickly and explained the menu and we ordered some wine. Smallish wine list but some great choices. Went for some Oregon pino.The meal started with amuse bouche of sweet pea soup with lobster, sweet corn and mint. This stuff was mouth watering. I could have had three more bowls....a solid start.Next was a summer salad of arugula, citrus, compressed cucumber, and tomatoes. Fresh and delicious.The only choice here, other than the drinks are to decide which entree you want. Tonight they had a choice between Hawaiian opah and flat iron steak. We ordered one of each. Both were amazing. The I fish had a wasabi flavored  purée side alone with a vegetable like hash ( I do it no justice ). So so,good. The steak was a perfect medium rare. My mouth is still watering just thinking about it.Desert was a light peach Napoleon. Light, sweet, and yummy.Yelp is rarely wrong. There is a good reason this place gets the best reviews. My wife was impressed, full, and snugly, just as planned. They even gave her a little birthday present.This was one of the best meals I have had in a long time. I have zero negative things to say. Bravo Cafe Monarch. Bravo.

Two caveats: 1. I have little-to-no experience with Indo-Chinese and 2. Anywhere in Charlotte with more than 10 options for veggies gets an obligatory additional star.But. Seriously. Where have you been all my life, Manchurian Pakora? This dish has no Western equivalent. Frying shreds of veggies coated in chickpea flour to crisp dumpling-land, then drowning them in a savory, spicy gravy - smothered in bird's eye chilis - hot damn, that's heaven in a stainless steel wok. All the entrees are. Served in woks, that is, on small metal stands. Neat! So yeah, there's the blacked-out-window massage parlor, strip joint, and lingerie shop all within a stone's throw of Fu Lin, but hey, that's what I like to call East Charlotte Panache. It's ok. Rent, in this strip mall, is obviously low (Don Pedro's is a two second walk away from here, home of even frugaler, if not quite as delicious, eats). Means you can get a ton of tasty food for cheap - unless you're ordering a paneer dish, or something seafoody, most of your options are 9 bucks a pop. Soups are either 2 or 4 - the larger price is a huge bowl for two.The options for us veggies are endless. If it's not on the menu as vegetarian, and it's in any way possible to prepare it vegetarian, they'll make it for you. Guy was emphatic about the "made to order from scratch" concept. He also did an awesome job of explaining the differences in Manchurian rather than Chili preparations, how they spice things for various orders (ie, dried versus fresh chili), all that good stuff that you want to hear when you're an annoying, inquisitive, first-time partaker of any new cuisine. Lettuce wraps (on the menu why? Don't care, only place in CLT to get it with tofu) were just as I've had elsewhere, except no pine nuts. Still tasty. Nothing we ordered, meat or veg, failed to surpass expectations - but beware - medium spicy is not your typical medium. Had some crying peeps at the table by the end of the meal, including moi - but that's how I like it.I demand a recount!  Just like Annie W. I too ordered the wrong item. But you know what?  I still love this crazy restaurant and I can't wait to return and order correctly. Because even though I ordered battered fried chicken swimming in gravy, (should have ordered it dry, how was I supposed to know?)  I appreciated the heat and I loved the lentil soup that was served before my lunch and my lunch was only $6.50. Hells yeah. The man at the counter was really pleasant too.  Let's get a group and go order EVERYTHING! A UYE Indo Chinese with training wheel session. Please and thank you.

Review Text :
Some call chicken "the tuna of the turf." I don't, and I tend to avoid those people at social events. They have names for everything and it gets annoying. Where's the boy's room? "The Throne Zone" is upstairs. "The Piss Palace" is down the hall. Ugh, shut up.That said, I call Rotisserie Romados "the purveyor of the single greatest roasted chicken dinner I have ever had in my entire life, based on my level of hunger, state of sobriety and availability of Five Alive juice drink."From the millisecond we stepped through the front door, the unreal aroma of those no-longer-egg-laying, piri-slathered, fire-kissed birds and fresh baked bread had us throwing 'bows to skip the line. In our minds, anyway. Other Yelpers talk about the pastry counter that tempts the poultry patrons, but I cannot comment. I wanted - nay, NEEDED - chiggin.A mere 15 minutes and 18$ CAD later, we're presented with Styrofoam go-boxes overstuffed with tender white and dark meat, a mountain of crispy crinkle-cut fries and a surprisingly fresh salad of mixed greens tossed in a light (mustard?) vinaigrette. We sat, transfixed. I took a picture of chicken for the first time ever. We ate. My soul took a picture of chicken for the first time ever.Remember those people that name everything? They might also be the type to talk about fleeing the States in times of political strife. "Can you believe Congress?," they'll say, "That's it. I'm moving to Canada." Whatever. Rotisserie Romados, though? Totally worth revoking your US citizenship.Did I mention they have Five Alive in a can? The Québecois need to adopt me, stat. I'll do windows!When I think of Montreal, Portuguese cuisine is not the first thought that comes to my mind.  Smoked meat and poutine may be the dishes that Montreal may be best known for, but you can add Portuguese Roast Chicken to that list.  At Rotisserie Romados, their Portuguese Roast Chicken is right up there with some of the best grilled chicken that I have eaten.  How good was the chicken? This was by far the best meal of my trip!Located in The Plateau neighborhood, Rotisserie Romados is about an 8-10 minute walk from the Mont Royal Metro station.  Upon first glance, I honestly thought that the outside facade of the eatery reminded me of a church.  That being said, this "church of chicken" is a fairly small eatery with a few seats if you choose to eat in, but primarily a place to order take out.  Besides the roast chicken, Rotisserie Romados also has a bakery that serves up a pretty respectable selection of mouth watering Portuguese pastries.As far as the food is concerned, let's just say that something is seriously wrong with you if you leave here hungry.  Eager to feast on some chicken that I had heard so much about, I ordered the 1/2 Chicken Plate that came with a salad and was covered with a  mountain of fries.  At only $8 CAD, this was such a great deal especially with the portions being so generous.  Grilled over charcoal, the roast chicken was extremely moist on the inside, but still retained a crispy crunch on the outside.  Although the chicken was probably tasty enough as is, I decided to have my chicken slathered with a spicy Piri Piri Sauce to get the full Portuguese Chicken experience since I had come all the way from Hawaii.  The spices from the Piri Piri sauce and the drippings from the chicken were the perfect sauce to dip my fries in to scoop up all that yummy flavor.If this were not good enough, the lady at the register also added in a free dessert to my lunch.  This would be more than enough for most people, but I always have room for dessert.  I do not speak any French or Portuguese, but I made sure to remember the words "Pastel De Nata."  This Portuguese Custard Tart was the perfect end to my chicken feast and just blew my mind by how creamy delicious it was.       Just writing this review makes my mouth water and brings back fond memories of my trip to Montreal.The line moves quick and the chicken is delicious, perfect, moist, magique. The hot sauce is important. The pieces of meat are quickly cleavered for you as they are taken off the grill when you order so watchout for little bits of bone.  Order in advance to skip the big line and walk right up to the counter on the left hand side. Natas are one of my favourite foods ever so I always grab some of those as well. The staff are funny and at least trilingual, the Portuguese patter keeps the place running and I love seeing the patient smile when the old folks come in.My new favorite fastfood joint.I dropped by here with a friend that wanted some good poutine and decided to trust the yelp reviews.I was BLOWN AWAY. 9$ for that huge ass delicious poutine?! Dear god. That was the best chicken I have ever tasted in my life. It was cooked to perfection and the fries were also incredibly good. The gravy seemed spicy but not nearly enough to create discomfort. (to yelpers reading this, I normally can't take spicy.)My friend couldn't even finish her poutine and I was filled for the whole day (rare feat for a 215lbs 6'2 guys).ABSOLUTE.MUST.TRY. They don't have much selection food-wise though but the taste and price make it up by far. Incredible selection of Portuguese drinks and well-priced deserts as well.The only bad thing is that there is no place to sit.  The tables and chairs are practically all squeezed in and it is kind of uncomfortable especially if you're taller.GO HERE.Edit: Still freaking out at how good the damn chicken is. If I wouldn't be 400lbs by the end of the month, I'd eat here everyday. P.S. Everything else on the menu is also well worth it like the half-chicken.

Review Text :
I'll be the first to give credit where credit is due: Olive Garden's recent rebranding efforts, with the new logo and font, and some more modern menu options, are welcome and give a nice facelift to the company.However, it may be too much change or not very well executed: menu now boasts a selection of "italian tapas" which are basically an extension of their appetizer menu, most of which are $5 or $6 and discounted to $4 during a happy hour special of sorts, offered Mon-Fri 3-6PM.Tried the polenta and shrimp dish- four shrimp atop a bed of polenta with a tomato and olive sauce, good value with four shrimp, but sauce was overly salty and unbalanced with many olives. Server apologetically revealed that the dish isn't going over well.Though they're most known for their pasta dishes (and, okay, breadsticks), I usually just come here for their unlimited soup and salad lunch special: $7 for as much of either as I like, along with breadsticks. Good value, and good flavors- I usually stick with the zuppa toscana, but the chicken and gnocchi is good for something different. In addition to the tapas portion, OG now has a small menu of featured dishes that are "healthy preparation"/lower-calorie than their typical pasta dishes. A few steps in the right direction, guys- now to work on the execution.Additional note: never get a cappuccino here. It's not worth the $4. Drive through a Starbucks afterward if you must. You'll thank me later.I primarily go to the Olive Garden for the bread sticks, soups, salads, wine and on occasion the never ending pasta bowl when they have it. Everything else they offer is okay and can be gotten in the frozen food aisle in the store with a better taste. The lines are extremely long when we go with a 30 to 45 minute wait and this is even worse when the temperature outside is over 90 degrees. The value for your money is okay, but could be a little better.

Ohhh DD Peckers - the Wednesday night trivia SPOT.  The owner, Justin, is a riot.  This place has a dive feel with KILLER wings - just make sure you get them well done! NOM.  Everything is good though - fried pickes, salads, cheese fries, you name it.As for trivia night - every Wednesday at 8:30PM.  Get there a little early to get a seat and order some grub.Just an age warning - the trivia is raunchy and oh so fun.  Don't bring your kids.  Come to get your drink on, relax and have a good laugh with Justin on the mic.This place is a blast.  Definintely recommend checking it out!With a name like DD Peckers, you can be sure you'll offend someone. But it's not about the name. Really. Just pretend you didn't hear it.Finding the place can be a little bit of a chore, since it's not much to look at - either inside or out. And once you're inside, there isn't much room to move around, especially if there's a crowd. You also may not want to look too closely.The name is actually "DD Peckers Wing Shack" - means that you ought to try the wings. So go wild. There are something like thirty flavors on the menu, from naked (in keeping with the theme of the place) to the alluring Hoisin Honey. Try them all if you are so inclined, but it might set you back a bit, a 5 wing order costing more than $4.I'm old, but that's not cheap. At least you get the celery and dressing included, not like 10 cent wings at the bar when you have to pay extra.The big downside is the service - it can be pretty slow, so be prepared to wait. And wait. And then wait some more. If you think you might want extra wings, order them up front, because you may not get a chance for a second order.

Review Text :
Ok, so after a round of shopping with my mom, we were STARVING.  Back when I lived in Scottsdale, there used to be a deli in this place, but since I moved down to Tempe, I didnt know that this place had changed hands.  Its located right off Northsight, next to Golds Gym, and a salon.The place is warmly decorated.  wood decor, with warm red colors.  Very relaxing and refreshing to walk into.The menu here is somewhat simple.  Part breakfast, part lunch, with a few options to those who are hungry.  I got the omlette, with tomatos, cheese and onions.  When it the food came out, it was so tasty!!  My mom had the crepes, and said it was the best crepes she has had in some time.   Best breakfast that I have had in some time.  Plus, our server was wonderful!!!  I would love to eat here more often, as I think it was worth the gas and time.So far so good, as I would take my parents back here to eat, or friends, dates of whatnot.  Great clean place with great service.5 stars for the category! Breakfast Joynt, you had me at sausage gravy.  Lovingly made top quality ingredients sausage gravy.  Fluffy and righteous biscuits.  Done just right bacon...slightly crispy, not a second overdone.  Wholesome pancakes with just the right proportion of flavors of milk, flour, eggs.  Eggs!  Fluffy scrambled eggs again done just right!  Ham!  I will eat it at the Joynt. I will get right to the point!  It is carved off the bone I am eating some now hold the phone.But wait there's more!  Breaded pork cutlet sandwiches!  Thin, crispy on the outside moist and tender inside.  Turkey club sandwich piled high, fresh and delicious!  French fries perfectly cooked and lightly salted.  The topper?  Baked apple pancakes.  These are very close to apple pie.  There were people at my table actually grabbing the remaining pieces of this by the handful and scarfing (you know who you are).How did I try so many dishes?  Big table and an event with family-style servings.  Wonderful time.Even the brewed house coffee was first rate!I had very high expectations for The Breakfast Joynt because so many gave it 5 stars, which means "As good as it gets, Woohoo!" according to Yelp.  My experience didn't live up to that but I'm willing to give them another try.This location was formerly a bar that was transformed into a breakfast restaurant.  The actual bar is still there, with a flat panel TV in the middle, but surprisingly the shelves are still empty all the way up to the ceiling.  They've only been there around 6 months, so maybe this will change as they settle into the location.  It has a very clean, upscale feel to it - something not out of place in North Scottsdale.  It's also easy to find once you're off the 101 onto Raintree, and then north on Northsight... it's on the right and shares parking with Gold's Gym that is easily seen from the road.I found the eggs to be good, and recommend steering towards the omelet choices.  Being from the South, it wasn't thrilling that the biscuits were somewhat small and square shaped, almost like a little dinner roll.  They have their own style (and they've informed me that they are homemade) but I was looking for something more substantial to be smothered in sausage gravy.  The pancakes were not served hot with the other food items, and they seemed to have settled and were somewhat chewy and elastic.Menu was rather straightforward and clear with sectioned boxes, with a nice highlight of their featured stuffed apple pancake.  I thought the description of "ham that falls off the bone" was repeated far too many times.Prices were very reasonable for Scottsdale.  The fresh squeezed orange juice was excellent.  Owners are very concerned about customers with less than a stellar dining experience, so I'll be sure to give the Breakfast Joynt another try with friends and family.I would say 4 1/2 stars, but as you may know, I don't round up.Well, we finally made it back to The BJ (Breakfast Joynt)...right after the March Yelp event at the BJ as promised...well, pretty close to right after the March event at the BJ.Okay, it's pretty much 1  1/2 months later, and we hadn't been back "up north" at breakfast time. As those of you who have ever read (or "scanned") my "reviews" (or scribblings') have surmised, I could almost be classified as "recluse" in my Yelp Personality Profile (you all filled yours out, didn't you?). I just don't get out much!So it was with some trepidation that I emerged into the sunlight this past Sunday to run a few errands, get a workout, have a little breakfast and then have a little family time. Did I say breakfast? Why yes I did. After a workout that I can only describe as "heroic", we were back in the car and headed home. Once again, according to GPS, someplace in the northern reaches of Scottsdale was right on my way from the Camelback Corridor (or "CaCo") to my home in Old Town Scottsdale (what is finally going to work here...OSco...OTS...OTSco...OTowSco...I just don't know:).I have to get that GPS fixed...but it did take me to the BJ for breakfast. It was nice to get back!We got there and they were pretty busy, but we were seated within about 5 minutes of arriving. Our server was a little bit discombobulated...lot's going on and part of the shift had been sent home, and then they got slammed! But she was sweet and going a hundred miles an hour and since we weren't in any particular hurry, that was not a problem.I love breakfast...OK, I pretty much love all food, but I really love breakfast and the BJ doesn't disappoint (when has the BJ ever disappointed:).Let's get back to biscuits and gravy...is what I said to our server. I also had the fresh OJ...tasting like it was being squeezed into my glass directly from the orange:)...I had tasted both items at the Yelp event and they are still terrific! The BJ does a real nice job with sausage gravy (and as you know, there isn't any food that gravy can't improve:)The Beautiful Carin had an egg white vegetarian omelet that she really enjoyed, and we split a side of ham (ham is a vegetable, right?:). Even the coffee was really good! I'm not saying it's D'Lish or Pascucci good, but good, straight ahead breakfast shop coffee:)David, the owner came out and said "hi" and we said "hi", and...OK, enough verbatim conversation, but it was nice of him to say hello and tell us how much he appreciated the Yelp event and our returning on our own...nice guy!Since we were in the near reaches of the great northern desert known as NoSco, we had dessert (dessert after breakfast...nice concept:) across the border in the Republic of Sweet...The BJ and ice cream...it just doesn't get better than that:)The BJ is one of the best breakfast places in town and not nearly crowded enough...yet.So, get on up to the near far north and add gravy to your life...your cardiologist won't be happy, but you'll thank me:)8/07Brunch was a side of one biscuit and sausage gravy.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/5Ip4_yFvx3sz4qMqxl-4mw?select=YLS5RPPN-YOKdeQod58wHg#YLS5RPPN-YOKdeQod58wHg  Tasty!  Next time, I'll ask for the gravy on the side, so that I may try the biscuit without it being soggy.  Will I find Joynt's biscuits to be crispy and flaky on the outside?  Hmm...  I hope!Delightful service- quick, attentive, and friendly.  Clean restroom.Can't wait till my next visit to Mayo Clinic so that I may breakfast at the Joynt!  (One might say consuming one too many a plate of biscuits and gravy could hasten one's chances of a visit to the Mayo Clinic.)This restaurant seems to have a split personality.  When they are good, they are very, very good.  Friendly service and well-prepared breakfasts (the Eggs Benedict and the Breakfast Fried Chicken were two favorites).  However, after nearly half of the times I have visited, I asked myself why I keep coming back.  Perhaps, like some sort of dysfunctional relationship, I only want to think of the 'good times' and hope that the rest gets better?  The Eggs Benedict is a hit or miss - I never know if my dish will show up with cold, rock hard yolks and practically raw hash browns.  The Breakfast Fried Chicken (served with eggs as well as a choice of toast or pancakes) is a good choice, but recently, the portion size has decreased while the price was raised (yes, we noticed the smaller plate).  Service is consistently inconsistent - it can either be attentive, or nonexistent.Yes, the place gets busy, but that isn't an excuse for a 45+ minute wait for food (while being completely ignored, without even a water refill).  It also isn't an excuse to cram tables so close together that on one occasion we were placed directly in the path of the traffic to/from the kitchen, with trays continually being hoisted over our heads.  Being busy doesn't mean that you can set tables with filthy (dried food caked on) silverware and then be surprised when I ask for another place setting.I think it is time to accept that our relationship just doesn't work, and move on.For my 1100th review, I'm going to use it on The Breakfast Joynt.Groupon has brought me and the family into this place over 8 times over the past year.  We've come in for Breakfast & Lunch.  More recently, Lunch, to avoid the long lines during the Breakfast hours.  Here's a tip, if you show up after 12 pm you'll be better off than before then to find a table.  This tip applies to Sundays, which is the day we prefer to go.Here are some of the items I've had here:The Basic (2 Eggs, Bacon, Hash Browns, Buttermilk Pancakes) - $7.99Breakfast Burrito (Scrambled Eggs, Sausage, Onions, Green Peppers, Cheddar Cheese) - $6.99Western Burger (Cheddar Cheese, Bacon, Onion Rings, and BBQ sauce) - $10.99Sack of 10 Angus Sliders - $12.99http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/5Ip4_yFvx3sz4qMqxl-4mw?select=mVXqbkwPFs19EnACRXJANA#mVXqbkwPFs19EnACRXJANAMy favorite is the Sack of 10 Sliders.  They're very good and you can take a few home for later!  The staff is friendly, but sometimes the food order can take a while. I hope they continue to do Groupon, because the deal is totally worth it here.Return Factor - 100%

Restaurant name  Feast Buffet
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
SIMPLY NOT THE BEST    Yesterday was about my third time catching the Feast Buffet at Texas Station's act. In Feast Buffet style the quality of the food could be good one visit and behind the eight ball on others. On yesterday's visit color me unimpressed with the quality of the food.  I arrived on the cue for Feast Buffet around 3:15 pm. It was a fairly long line that moved on the slow side because not all stations were available. The upside to the line management is that when I approached the front there was a register on both sides. If you've been to the Feast Buffet at Red Rock or Green Valley Ranch, you have to get off the line to pay then get back in line while being assertive about preventing people from the VIP lines cutting into your side. This line management technique raised my rating from 2 8/10 stars to 3. The thing is that the buffet wasn't really worth the wait.   The admission for a buffet adventure on Sunday is around $10.50 for all day brunch. In my honest opinion the brunch buffet is a gimmick to raise the price of lunch just like Red Rock adding some peeled shrimp to their Saturday buffet and calling it the shrimp and rib night to raise the price. Personally at 3:15 pm in the afternoon, I don't want an American food station for example to have zero corn niblets in place of scrambled eggs.  Both the selection and taste were bland. The Asian foods station was lacking on chow fun, spicy eggplant, and cabbage for example. The Italian food station was mostly spaghetti, meatballs, and filler food. And contrary to the majority of the Feast Buffets an ice cream station was nonexistent. The food was so forgettable. For example, the rib was mostly a sticky bone. The temperature of the coffee was below my expectations. My favorite part of the meal was the wonton soup. I did not have the usual experience that I have at the Sunset Station Buffet where the bowl of wonton soup is all broth and carrots.  What about the service? Just like the majority of Feast Buffets there is one overworked server balancing several tables worth of dishes. I did find it discusting looking at all the used plates at the vacated table to my left for a good half hour.   Feast Buffet at Texas Station is simply not the best. I know that they will never be the best. But they could be a lot better than they were today.

Restaurant name  Le Club Chasse et Pêche
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
Le Club Chasse et Peche (literally, The Hunting and Fishing Club) is like a secret Speak Easy of yesteryear, with only a sign with their emblem and a street address, with no name announcing what lays inside the unassuming Tudor styled facade on the bottom floor of a multi-story building in old Montreal, not far from city hall. And like a Speak Easy club, inside lies a cave or cellar like chamber of rooms with low ceilings, brick construction, and dark paint covering the walls, with only highlight lighting resembling candles or torches in a medeival basement or monastery. In Le Club, discerning diners, foodies, business people and Quebecois dine alongside the corrupted politicians and Mafiosa that have made the tabloids a-chatter with pay-off scandals of recent news.The relaxed atmoshphere, paced professional service, and excuisitely delicious food make this a special dining destination in Montreal. We had a party of 9 for a business dinner after a long day of meetings. After a snail's paced start (I am not talking about L'escargot, but rather a slug's traveling speed) in which we were refilled water 3 times but not served bread or anything else until our wine was selected, things picked up very well into an enjoyable experience. After starting with a Pinot Noir from France in honor of our Pinot Noir gentleman wine maker from Oregon's famed Williamette Valley who graced our party, we finally had the limited menu handed out to us, and eventually read and explained to us, dish by dish by our servers.The menu for the day had perhaps half a dozen appetizers and about the same in main entrees. (See picture of menu for selections)Everyone thoroughly enjoyed their selected delicate combinations of flavors and eye appealling presentations of both the appetizers and entrees. The dessert and coffee was wonderful as well. The prices were not that unreasonable for the quality of the food, but expect to pay about $15 - $22 for appetizer plates and $35 plus et moins for most entrees, with special mains going up to $50. Parking is non-existent and on the streets of Montreal. There is a coat check room and a cute hostess to greet you. Waiter service was professional, but relaxed. The place doesn't have a stuffy bone in its body, so you can enjoy the good food without feeling like you are being graded on your dining etiquette.  We all enjoyed our meals and would certainly come back again for another chance to break bread for business or dine with our favorite somebodies.Disarming and unobtrusive serviceWhimsical, restful, tasteful decorMassive entree portions and small appetizersVegetarians bewareDuck with plums and foie gras... Super rich and good on a bed of quinoa and chopped nutsScallops appetizer seared to perfection and drizzled with a surprising candied lemon sauceVegetables with panache was a surprise, four vegetable sides on a plate, great bargain.

Restaurant name  Viva Mexico

Review Text :
Although I was having fun traveling, and in love with Edinburgh, I couldn't shake the emptiness that I felt. It had been several weeks since I left the west coast of California and therefore just that much time since I had enjoyed a burrito...or even a taco.  I could feel the absence of Mexican food and it weighed upon me.Then, one evening, as I glanced out of the window from where we were staying, I noticed the "Viva Mexico" sign.  "Mexican food...in Scotland? Get the [insert expletive here] out!" I exclaimed. I was sure it was merely travel weariness playing tricks upon me. So, we went the next evening to check out what I was sure would prove a mirage.The "Viva Mexico" experience did not disappoint.  The price at first was shocking for thanks to geography, I'm accustomed to getting superb Mexican food at bargain-basement prices.  The food was was in retrospect, acceptable, but at the time the fact that it was Mexican food (extra star!) made it taste as if each dish were sprinkled with magic.  We ordered a tomato-based tortilla soup, quesadillas (they call them quesadas and in their defense, they were big), Sonora style-refried beans, and they special made some potato-chickpea flautas.  We topped these off with freshly made margaritas.  The dinner was expensive but the atmosphere was lively and the staff was both sweet and accommodating.  And, it instantly cured my culinary case of homesickness. TIP: If you go, sit in the back.  You'll get a glorious view overlooking Waverley bridge.

Review Text :
I've been to Pure Sushi's Old Town location once for drinks and once for dinner... and I intend to return again as I had really good experiences both times.  The sushi is a tad expensive, but you get what you pay for - the quality is high!  Fresh and flavorful, I enjoyed pretty much everything I tried when i was there.  The highlights for me included:*cucumber sunomono*seaweed salad*edamame*box sushi - my favorite - a must order!*salmon sashimi - incredible!*yellowtail sashimiNice wine selection - we sampled several whites... and our service was attentive as well.  As for ambiance - the 'cell phone booth' by the bathroom is a nice touch, and I'd agree with the reviews that came before this one - it is hip, cool, clean, and located in Old Town... don't knock 'em for that.  Cool location next to AZ 88, the Mondrian, and Scottsdale Center for the Arts.The lunch specials look like they are priced well and the dinner main courses sound pretty amazing too.  Pure and simple - I can't wait to return soon!

Restaurant name  Zaytoon Mediterranean Market and Kabob
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
The Skinny: craving Mediterranean food - this place totally satisfies from their decadent Mushi to the Koobideh Kabob. (4) service: the owners are super friendly and food is served promptly (5),overall - it's rare to find a joint where you want to return to explore the different dishes of a culture. Zaytoon is one of those places (4.5).I was craving hummus with some pita one day and the hubs found this place on Yelp. After that fateful night - we've been back at least 3x within the last week -- yes, it is that good.The key dishes here IMHO are the appys (priced at $3.99 each). Our by far favs are the masto khiar (yogurt and cucumber) and the masto musir (shallot with yogurt). The yogurt itself is so thick and luscious, I bet you could turn the bowl over and not a dollop would escape. Yes it is that decadent. Paired with endless piping hot sesame topped Iranian flatbread (FYI -the owners keep the bread coming) - oh so crispy, flaky - it is definitely addicting. We've tried both the hummus and the kashe bademjaan (roasted eggplant dip) too which are both very good as well. I've tried their falafel and veggie sandwiches with both optional sides of the shiraz salad and fries. The sandwiches are loaded with onions, tomatoes, green peppers and cucumbers with a ?yogurt sauce and is oh so delicious. The falafel is crispy on the outside while retaining its fluffy interior. Completely satisfying.The shiraz salad was nicely acidic to accompany the richness of the other items. Dressed with mint and citrus, the flavours of the onion, cucumber, tomato mixture really pop. The fries are okay and the portions are generous.My hubby loves to get their chicken soltani. Both the chicken and koobedeh kabobs are well seasoned and moist. The plate comes with a roasted tomato, onions served with a bed of basmati rice. The butter and sumac on the table are used to dress the rice. We tried their pistachio ice cream flavoured with rosewater and saffron. Nicely floral with some cardamom mixed it, it was a nice way to finish a meal and cleanse the palate.Every time we go there, I'm always looking around and try to see what other people are getting so we can try it next time. We saw another gentleman who ordered the koobideh kabob with fresh herbs and on fresh bread (aka KGB) which looked intriguing and has been put on our list to try the next time we are there. Not to mention there was an interesting stew they were offering over a different type of rice. The spinach soup and lamb shank sounded wonderful too.A key factor to why we keep coming back is the service. The owners of the restaurant are really obliging and willing to take the time to explain the different dishes they offer. I was a little bit curious about their torshi - it's some form of Persian pickled vegetables. The owner actually brought some out for me to try and warned me it was an acquired taste (it was actually very good - a little bit sweet, nicely spiced --- however the hubs didn't care for it). It's really cool that they would do that.Overall, this a great little neighbourhood joint that serves some delicious, intriguing eats for reasonable prices. Throw in the friendly service,  you have a hidden gem - not to be missed! 4.5 stars out of 5.After seeing the reviews from some good Yelp friends, I knew I had to stop and try Zaytoon.  My friends are right.  This place is great!I've only had Persian food once, in Los Angeles, so I'm still learning.  After studying the menu, I went with their KGB sandwich--Koobideh Kabob that's served on their fresh baked bread and served with some sliced onion, plenty of basil greens, a roasted tomato, and a grilled jalapeño.  The beef was excellent.  The juices soaked the bread that covered the entire plate.  I got an iced tea with my dinner.Service was excellent.  An older man waited on me originally and then was replaced by a younger man--the owner, I believe.  Iced tea was refilled twice with no need to ask for a refill.  The server checked back to make sure everything was OK.Since I'm such a babe in the woods with this cuisine, I asked the owner if there was a correct way to eat the food.  He said what I had done was exactly the way he does it.  Let the juices soak the bread and enjoy all the richness of the dish.I left without checking out the store section.  When I got home I saw Tony's photo of the ice cream and I wanted to kick myself.  However, with how good this meal was, I'll be a regular.  I have to try some different dishes and enjoy some dessert.I was so thrilled that I finally came in here to dine! I've driven past it many times and never thought to stop in until I read the great reviews on Yelp.It's a small grocery shop joined by the small dining area on the other side. The grocery side has some exotic offerings that you would have a tough time finding anywhere else. I've become addicted to the Mashti Malones pistachio. It's not your average pistachio.. it's bright yellow and you can taste cardamom, rose water, whole chewy pistachio bits! It's insane! I haven't purchase anything here but the ice cream, to be honest.. once I found it it was like tunnel vision.. However, the produce seems to be very reasonable and I could see myself coming here for vegetables now.So, the restaurant portion! They offer freshly made juices with some interesting combinations like carrot and rose water. I had a watermelon juice which was delightful and oh-so refreshing. On my first visit here, the service was sort of spotty. On the second visit, they were much much friendlier, and maybe this comes from them treating you more like a regular once they know you're not just a one time visit.The fresh warm lavash they serve here is dotted with sesame seeds and blistered just a little bit. They'll bring you an unending amount of this bread until you say Uncle!  It seems to be made to order, and is perfect for dipping in their bracing hummus, enlivened from the addition of lemon juice. I find most hummus seems to lean towards lemon, or tahini. Theirs is lemony. Oh, and endless lavash. The server was kind of enough to make many recommendations and answer any question without missing a beat. Did I mention endless lavash?So far here I've had their chicken kabob wrap with house salad. The chicken was cooked perfectly, and seasoned well. The fresh tomatoes in there just added to brightness of the wrap, and it was big enough that I took half of it home. The salad is a mix of tomatoes, cucumbers and onions that have been diced and tossed with some parsley, mint, lemon and olive oil.The koobideh is seasoned ground beef kabob, which is very traditional, and amazing! Very tender, perfectly seasoned, a lot of interesting flavors. All of the kabobs come with steamed rice and a charred tomato. Love me some charred tomato!Part market, part restaurant. But, it's all good. From the outside of this family owned shop you'll be unaware of the awesomeness that lies within. After several visits it's become my regular spot for Mediterranean food. Their two page menu is packed with tantalizing dishes. But after visiting here at least once a week for the past month I'm addicted to the koobideh kabob ($9.99) -- two skewers of ground beef marinated in a wonderful blend of spices. I've tried other items but keep going back to my first love -- the koobideh. The chicken kabobs ($9.99) are well seasoned and usually enough food for two meals. If you want to try both, get the chicken soltani ($12.99)  which has one skewer each of the chicken and koobideh. The filet in the Barg kabob ($16.99) was decent, but a little tough. For apps, the falafels ($3.99) and hummus ($3.99) are as good as you'll find anywhere in town.Mom and Pop operation with a Persian Grocery store adjacent to the restaurant. They have the best and juiciest Beef Koobideh in town. Their oven baked bread is a must with the Yogurt and Shallot side.They also serve fresh squeezed juices, which is a bonus. Polite service and casual environment makes for a very satisfying meal!

Restaurant name  Flavors of Louisiana

Review Text :
It is so hard to find good southern food in this town. So far I have had the shrimp etoufee and and shrimp po'boys. There is nothing fancy about this place, however the food is amazing. Located in of course, a strip mall, next to LA Fitness. Somewhat hard to see, but definetly worth checking out. The prices are great too. Everything is under $10. Their menu has catfish, shrimp, chicken and a few other things. This is just a mom & pop little place which is awesome. I hope this place sticks around.Eureka! At last, we have found the cajun food we have been long-seeking -- homey, authentic, real deal stuff. Not fancy foo foo "takes" on cajun food. Not watered-down,  dumbed-down versions of cajun food. Just the good, real, stuff, lovingly, and painstakingly prepared with quality ingredients.Yes, the po' boys are good. The bread is spot-on, the ingredients cooked just right. Even the spicy tartar sauce (ya know, remoulade) is right. But po' boys aren't too much of a challlenge.The entrees will make you or break you. Since I've only been once (so far!) I've only had opportunity to try the crab landry - garlic bread, sauced with crab stew, and topped with a few fried shrimp.I could not stop tasting and analyzing that stew. It was full of layers of flavor - smoky, sweet, spicy, earthy, a slight hint of briny - all cooked down and blended into luscious deep brown brew of deliciousness!The dining room has all the atmosphere of a hospital cafeteria. Can we get some music maybe, at least? But I can easily deal with that, for the sake of the food.Wow. Even Lafayette, LA born Hubby was seriously impressed with Flavors of Louisiana. The restaurant was far from full on a Saturday night, but the customers came in steadily. It is a small place, but very clean, and rather sparsely decorated. At least you can taste right away where their priorities are. Hubby had the special of the night- three pieces of tender, perfectly cooked catfish smothered in crawfish etoufee. He had asked for, and was told that he would receive etoufee only, but got the special anyway. He loved it, but this mix-up is the reason for the 4 stars. Even though it was in a darker roux, which he normally does not prefer, he licked his plate clean. I got the shrimp po'boy which came in a large basket with fries. It was two 6" halves of a fresh baguette with lettuce, tomato, a zippy sauce, and plenty of perfectly cooked battered and fried shrimp. Our dining companions had an equally huge and tasty fried oyster po'boy, a side of fresh and tangy cole slaw, and a bowl of delicious seafood gumbo. Nothing was spicy, just super flavorful. The boys got the peach cobbler dessert, and even though we girls both said we didn't much care for peach cobbler, we certainly helped the boys polish off the big bowls when they got to the table. Even though FOL is quite a drive for us, we will be back very soon. Please note that as of October 1, 2009, they will be closing early on Saturday nights- 8:00 instead of 9:00 PM.We had originally attempted to come here a few months ago, but our friends decided it looked "too cheap, dirty, and gross."  Ugh... we swore that we would come back next time we were out in the neck of the woods and I am really glad we did!  The restaurant is located in an average looking strip mall and the interior is just as average.  That's fine by me though.  Like someone else said in their review, at least I can see where their priorities are.  I ordered the 2 meat combo with shrimp and crawfish tails.  It was served with my choice of side, and I went with the cole slaw.  I was surprised at how flavorful the cole slaw actually was.  The shrimp were big and their outsides were really crispy.  They were quite yummy.  There were tons of baby crawfish tails, battered and fried like the shrimp.  Those were also yummy and quite succulent.  I really really enjoyed my meal.If you come here, don't make the mistake that I did and not notice the yummy seasoning on the table.  I didn't notice it until after I was full, but I sampled it, and it was DELICIOUS!  I will definitely come back here next time I am in the area.We are always loking for places to eat that remind us of places we've lived or visited.  On this day it seemed like a good day for a Louisiana roast beef po-boy. We've been to Johnny's and to Pakway's several times in New Orleans and they both serve these amazing hot roast beef po-boys, dripping in sauce (mixture of beef au jus and mayo) topped lightly with a little lettuce, a few tomatoes and pickles all wrapped up in a very crunchy baguette role. So we Yelped po-boy places and Flavors of Louisiana popped up.  At first we had a hard time finding the Flavors of Louisiana.  Its set off the very busiy road in a small strip center, so look for their sign atop the building.  The Yelp directions will take you right to it. Well we were hopping to find a roast beef po-boy like we would get at Johnny's or Parkway's in New Orleans but... not here unfortunately.  What we did find was an amazing shrimp po-boy and some excellent fried catfish topped with crawfish étouffée.   Both were very good and very similar to what we would find in New Orleans.  We also had some gumbo, which was good but missing the roux was too thin and missing the andouille sausage but had plenty of shrimp and crab.  This is a great place to eat if you're craving some southern fried catfish or even a fried shrimp po-boy!  You won't be disappointed!I just can't.I can't write about the amazing po' boys. The glorious boudin. The succulent fried green tomatoes. I especially can't write about the to-die-for peach cobbler a la mode.I can't write about it because I can't eat it anymore. I'm a little verklempt, please give me a moment...Ahem. Okay, that's better.Try the gumbo if you want to live dangerously, it's spicy! And the crawfish boil is one of the tastiest things I've ever eaten, if also one of the messiest.Go and eat all of the things. When you do, please have a shrimp po' boy for me.I'll just be over here, hoping for a miracle drug that allows me to ingest gluten. If that dream ever becomes a reality, Flavors of Louisiana will definitely be my first stop.UPDATE: I received the following message from the owner:Hi Beth, Man do i have good news for you. We have a lot of Gluten free items on our menu!!! Yes i was a nurse for 25 years before opening my restaurant and Celiac disease was just becoming a known thing. So we can blacken any of our meats for you with our gluten free blackening seasoning. Also we fry in a mixture of corn meal and corn flour so no wheat flour goes in it. Just ask for your fried foods to be done in the cornmeal mixture instead of the flour. We have french fries, cajun chips, potato salad, cole slaw, dirty rice and red beans are all gluten free. Also if you come on Monday we have our Jambalaya and that is gluten free as well. So come on back and let us feed you some good and i mean real good gluten free food!!Jennifer GoffownerThis is a really nice family owned restaurant that is located on the far West side of town. It is definitely worth the drive. Good friend from Louisiana told me about this place and her food. So I got in my car and had to check them out right away.Inside is very casual with a vibe that reminds me a eating in one of those smaller towns down south. Decor is very simple with touches of the bayou and it's critters sprinkled here and there. The smell of the food instantly puts me right into the zone.Really love the Cajun Food and the Cool Cajun Zydeco music playing playing in the back ground. They have both a lunch menu and a larger dinner menu. You can order off the dinner menu at lunch if you are really hungry. The portions are bigger and there are more choices.So far we have tried the Dunkin Catfish, the Alligator and Crawfish Po-Boys and both of the Gumbos. How can you go wrong with Catfish placed on top of rice and then covered with Crawfish Etouffee. We also tried the fried Green Tomatoes on our last visit.The food is cooked and seasoned with tender loving care. Everything taste fresh and the prices are very affordable. You can always add some extra heat by choosing one of the hot sauces to kick things up a notch.Service is friendly and helpful. This is not a well polished chain restaurant with robots reading scripted dribble. Just great food with a fun and tasty menu.Use your GPS if you are coming from way across town. They are located in a large shopping center towards the back and the sign is a little hard to see from the street. PARTY IN MY MOUTH!4.5 STARSLouisiana meets ArizonaMy friends and I are always on the lookout for non-chain restaurants in the West Valley. After reading fellow "yelpers" reviews, we decided to give Flavors of Louisiana a shot and I am so glad we did. Flavors of Louisiana got it right. Fresh food, flavorful ingredients, large portions, modest prices, excellent cutomer service and  easy access parking out front.Flavors of Louisiana has a  laid back casual atmosphere.  As you walk in you see the front cashier where you order your food.  On the walls are some LSU teeshirts and logos , a bayou mural on another wall, and smiling and helpful staff. On our first visit we shared, catfish Po-Boy, hush puppies, shrimp, fresh bread, and Boudin Balls. Everything was perfectly breaded and fresh. We also had sides of the Red Beans and Rice (highly recommend) as well as cole slaw which was also very good. Flavors of Louisiana offers great food for the money! (each sandwhich & side are about $10 for the 6").If you ever in the area you should give flavors of Louisiana a try. You won't be disappointed.

before yelp canada arrived, i had to go to the streets to find the cool, local spots in quebec.  thanks to an awesome dood that held down a convenient store, he let me in on what he called the current hot-spot in montreal.made it to old montreal via cab in less than 6 dollars from le centre sheraton.  the lounge is actually connected to a beautiful hotel- notre dame.i went in and was impressed by the exquisite design aspects that reaked of pretentiousness, but this was deflated when i was serviced by the very down to earth barkeeps that were both very model-esque.after swigging on a generous pour of macallan, i asked of any jazz bars that were open...the monica belluci doppelganger asked if i made it to the terrace yet.  that is one thing you realize in quebec, all the hit-spots have a terrace.made it to the eighth floor from the elevator, confused...walked through a kitchen which brought me to one of the f*cking most incredible skyline views i have witnessed.the dj was kicking some 90's hip-hop- black sheep's blue cheese and from there the stage was set.  beautiful people, very international crowd (heard like six languages being spoken among groups), well-mixed drinks.  i ended up taking it all in, along with a few gin-tonics- which is one of the most ordered drinks in this town and then headed out to cruise old montreal a bit.

Restaurant name  Habanero's Mexican Grill
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
Here is the story of how we fell in love with a little Mexican restaurant called Habanero's: Friday: Did a random yelp search for Mexican food in the Scottsdale area and stumbled upon some decent reviews for this place. Decided to try it out since it's not too far. After a slight detour we finally found a little unassuming store front in a generic looking shopping plaza with a red, white and green banner in front and knew that we must have finally found it. Ordered some flour tacos (fish, carne asada, shrimp, and carnitas) and a steak quesadilla along with a side of chips and salsa and our beloved Orange Bang drink that we were pleasantly surprised to find here. Within a few minutes of taking our first bites we turned to each other and proclaimed, "This shit is good!!" Fresh Mexican food that was reasonably priced and not overloaded with grease!! We were officially in lust. Saturday: Couldn't stop thinking about how good Habanero's was from the night before and made plans to stop by for breakfast the next morning and try some of their breakfast burritos. Sunday: Stopped by to grab a few breakfast burritos before our road tip to eat in the car. Bacon and steak burritos were delicious and not greasy at all, just like the rest of the menu. Egg, potatoes, meat and cheese in a fresh tortilla make these burritos worth coming back for again! And, breakfast served all day during the weekdays! Sweet! Monday: Craving Habanero's again and we even made plans to stop by on our way back into town. Unfortunately for us, they closed early for the holiday, but we were more determined than ever to get our fix in the next day! Nothing could keep these star crossed lovers apart! Tuesday: The craving was almost unbearable at this point. As soon as we got off of work we headed over to our new favorite place to pick up some tacos and another breakfast burrito. We were not disappointed, everything was just as amazing as the last few times we had visited. Habaneros can do no wrong! So there you have it...if you're in the north Scottsdale area and craving some fresh authentic Mexican food that won't break the bank then head over to Habanero's and you'll be falling in love in no time at all!5/31/13Finally stopped in for my first time visit to order takeout.  Since it was my first time, I wanted to check out the menu board overhead, but staring up at menu boards while people are waiting to take my order has never been my cup o' tea, so I looked around for a leaflet to peruse through, instead.  I liked the open layout of the grill and kitchen, as i was able to see the cooks in action.  I read under "Habanero Specialties" a listing for Chiles rellenos, a roasted poblano chile stuffed with jack cheese combo (rice, choice of beans-refried or black, choice of tortillas (corn, wheat, or flour) and pico de gallo for $9, and I'm a cheese-lover, so I had to try this. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/habaneros-mexican-grill-scottsdale?select=GtRJBN7OK6Vhu6x-zgZgrA#GtRJBN7OK6Vhu6x-zgZgrA  Looking around for a meaty meal, I saw under "Parrillada," that I could get a four-meat combo http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/habaneros-mexican-grill-scottsdale?select=GtRJBN7OK6Vhu6x-zgZgrA#vd5i45jyypKwClT1WigsnQ (grilled steak and chicken, chorizo, and carnitas, with rice, choice of beans, choice of tortilla, guacamole, and sour cream for one person, $11, but I also noticed that diners could add shrimp to their meals, so I wondered if the red meats were grilled alongside the shrimp (I'm allergic to shellfish), or perhaps there is a designated area where shrimp are partitioned away from the other meats, and looking past the order-taker's shoulder, I could see that shrimp are indeed cooked on the same grill with the meats.  I told the order-taker that I would like to try some of their barbecue, but I can't if the meats are cooked in the same area as the shrimp, since I have a shrimp allergy, and she fired off a few sentences in Spanish to the cook, who replied with a few sentences of his own, after which she turned to me and said that my meats would be prepared in a separate pan.  Sweet!!While my orders were cooking, I surveyed the place and observed that while the resto is small, it didn't FEEL small, because of all the flourishes that gave the place a bigger presence (wooden furnishings and counters, a mini-bar with a handful of Mexican beer pumps, a small fridge stocked with bottles of Mexican beer if you don't want to order drafts, a counter in front of the grills where you may dine, or sit and sip on a pint of beer while you wait for your takeout (which is what one guy did while I paid for my order and waited it out on one of the dining tables).  There's even patio seating, should you choose to dine alfresco, or if you don't want to leave the restaurant smelling like you spent all day cooking in the kitchen!Both dishes were muy delicioso!  Since I had two entrees, I decided to try both bean choices (refried and black), as well as two tortilla choices (wheat and flour), and they were all very good!  The black beans were soft and tender- I was expecting something like biting into boiled lima or kidney beans, but the black beans were softer, more akin to firm, spring peas (not mushy!).  I also appreciated that both bean choices weren't very salty and tasted freshly-prepared and sprinkled with cotija cheese, not from cans and doctored over the stove.  The chile relleno batter tasted decidedly eggy, which I did not mind, but if you don't like your foods eggy, then you might want to stay away from this dish.  I usually try to avoid tomatoes (inflammatory), but the pico de gallo smelled so bright and flavorful that I couldn't resist, and I'm glad I didn't, for it complemented the cheesy relleno perfectly!  As for the barbecue meats, I liked them all, even the spicy chorizo!  I'd say the grilled steak was my fave, followed by the diabolical chorizo, which also came with similarly-seasoned, grilled cubed potatoes.  (I didn't mind the spice level of the chorizo while the meal was fresh, but I noticed that it tasted too salty and too spicy for me to tolerate subsequent leftover meals- strange, that.)  While I enjoyed the grilled chicken (I try to avoid anything corn-based, since I'm allergic to corn, and yes, that would also include eggs... one or two in a batter is OK for me on most days), I wondered if I could order my next barbecue combo sans chicken and with more grilled steak, instead?  Doesn't hurt to ask...I returned the next night for another installment, since Mom finished the chile relleno leftovers soon after I arrived home with them.  Would love to go back and dine-in one of these days, and perhaps enjoy a complementing beverage and dessert with my meal!  :)  Mmm... happy hour menu sounds delightful, too!http://www.habaneros.mx/Happy_Hour.html

Restaurant name  Daddy Duke's
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
It's been almost five months since my first visit, and I thought it's about time I gave Daddy Duke's a second chance.  I called in my order at around 2:15p of Penne Romagno ($9.95) for dine-in since I hadn't had anything to eat since 11p the night before.  I arrived at DD's around 2:25 only to find that the cook had waited until my arrival to start on the dish- I spotted him cutting up the peppers and prosciutto and adding them to the pan.  The pasta was delivered to my table about ten minutes later.  I decided to try their sweet potato fries ($4.50), extra crispy, without the pancake syrup it normally is served with.  I loved the penne dish!  Mind you, it didn't look as appetizing as it could have; I thought that the glistening prosciutto looked half-cooked.  One bite took care of that suspicion- it was delicious!  The feta cheese (some crumbled, some still sporting shape of the container it was shaped in) and roasted red peppers dressed the dish up a bit.  The SPF looked great, but wasn't as crispy as it looked, so in they went for a second frying.  Needless to say, they didn't look as delectable when they were brought back, but at least they were of the texture I was looking for.I also tried their two-pizza slice and soda lunch special ($5, add. topping $0.50 each), with ricotta and roasted red peppers.  I did ask if they used corn in their pizza and was told no.  Not even on the bottom to make the pizzas slide easier out of the oven.  I don't know how I forgot to ask if they served thin-crust since it is my preferred choice, but I did, and sure enough, the slices that were brought to my table were more doughy than I cared for.  I thought perhaps the wider edge fo the pizza crust would at least deliver the crispiness I was looking for, but the crunch factor disappeared, no exaggeration, within two minutes or less from time of arrival.  The ricotta looked fantastic, and while the red peppers looked OK, they weren't roasted.  The marinara sauce used was good.  DD's now serves Berto's gelato desserts (triangular wedges of differing flavors, including chocolate hazelnut, cappucino crunch, white princess, and spumoni)!  Cheesecake flavors come in plain, strawberry- or raspberry topped, and oreo.  A server told me they're trying to convince management/pastry chef into baking a peanut butter cheesecake.  Sounds like a great plan to me!Don't recall seeing a water fountain indoors during my first visit, but there certainly is one now.  The stuffed Easter bunnies adorning the feature (they've also invaded the women's restroom!) do not lend the restaurant a classy look, although I think it's a more casual atmosphere the owners are trying to achieve here.  Finding another way to advertise Sunday breakfasts and other specials, currently achieved by posting copy paper over the green window shutters and any wall space available, would do wonders for the ambience.  Seriously, the signs posted on the entrance door, on the register counter, and those propped on the dining tables are sufficient!

Restaurant name  Eggspectation Dejeuner & Cafe
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
As if it wasn't obvious already, my favorite breakfast food is hash browns. Next on the list would be eggs, usually mixed together with my favorite shredded potatoes. If I can't have them together, I'll usually choose eggs on their own for how versatile they are. This is where Eggspectations comes in, a downtown Montreal brunch chain that specializes in all things eggs.In spite of it's cheesy name, my expectations were high for Eggspectations. Packed with locals and tourists alike, the place is considered large for the establishments around here, yet there is almost always a wait. Best find what looks worthy on the menu before being seated since service and food can test one's patience on any hungry day.The food hasn't disappointed so far. While I've had their breakfast eggs straight up (sunnyside up, over easy, scrambled) as noted in their regular platters, I'm much more a fan of their omelettes and eggs benedict, the latter of which has it's own section complete with all the benedict variety one could ask for. Favorites in that section include the florentine benedict (spinach, gruyere, hollandaise), breton benedict (crepes, ham, gruyere, hollandaise), and the boca raton (spinach, guacamole, gruyere, hollandaise). Most of the eggs are poached to perfection and the toppings make for a nice kick in the overall flavor, they just need more potatoes to soak up some of that yolk. Feel like going the traditional route? Try their regular platters and enjoy the egg-y names like the egg-chilada, (an ode to a Mexican eggs style i.e. huevos a la Mexicana), egg-stravaganza (french toast platter), oy-vegg (Jewish style breakfast), egg-CITEment (strawberry flambe + eggs), and many more creative naming schemes. What matters is the food is simple and certainly brunch fulfilling, even if there are few items under $10.In the end, this place is just a glorified Denny's with a special emphasis on eggs. It would've been fitting for it to be a Canadian chain but I learned recently it's also in Virginia and Maryland (huh?). Chains are one thing, breakfast is another, but breakfast chains will almost always get a thumbs up in my book. Eggspectations gets my vote for a solid option in good ol Montreal.Fabulous eggs benedict and waffles. The french toast was kind of mediocre but we came here two days in a row because of the friendly service and willing to adjust items due to food allergies. Both days I got the chicken eggs benedict the first day were the potatoes and the next day I paid a little extra for the garden salad which was pretty average. Husband got waffles first day which were excellent but the French Toast he got the second day was quite average. Tons of seating including outdoor I would love to come back

Restaurant name  Cafe On Main
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
The Cafe on Main in Sharpsburg is often overlooked when Pittsburghers are pondering where to go for breakfast. I've always thought it was a shame that this place wasn't more popular as they serve a very good breakfast.  Their pancakes are flavorful and come with many options (blueberry, banana & chocolate hazelnut, choc chip & pecan, etc), their omelets are loaded with fixin's, they use a quality ciabatta bread for their breakfast sandwiches, their corned beef hash is outstanding, etc.  The only breakfast item that I would ding are their sausage links.  They look, taste, and have the texture of pre-made, pre-cooked, links that have been microwaved. In fact the sausage links seem like what you'd get at McDonalds. So, you're probably wondering why did I give them just 2 stars?  Well, I brought my brother, sister-in-law, & nephews in from out east and my mom & Dad in from the North Hills to enjoy a Father's Day brunch at the Cafe on Main.  My Dad arrived early and took a seat in their waiting area.  Dad gave an older "gentleman" who appeared to be running things (the owner?) his name and the size of our group and was curtly told "we don't seat you until everyone is here." My Dad clearly wasn't asking to be seated in the dining room yet - he had settled in on a chair in the waiting area. A few minutes later my Dad asked this "gentleman" if he could have a cup of coffee. The response? "I'm waiting on customers."  So I suppose an elderly man who has told you that a group of 7 will be eating at your establishment on Father's Day isn't a "customer"?   Our full group arrived and after waiting about 15 more minutes (Dad had patiently waited, with no beverage, over 45 min) , we were seated.   Our waitress was nice and helpful.  She would disappear for long stretches but we knew it was a busy day for them so we didn't get frustrated.  As various people finished eating she was quite prompt with clearing the table, which we appreciated. As our meal was winding down, I paid the check so that would be taken care of and we could leave as soon as everyone finished eating.  Given that it was a holiday and I could see how hard she was working while keeping a smile on her face, I left a 30% tip. So, it seems we have a delightful Dad's Day, right?  Well, almost.  Despite the fact that two people in our group were still eating, the "gentleman" who was running the show came over to our table and quite rudely told us that "people were waiting" and we needed to "move on out."  His tone was abrasive and there was not even a hint of courtesy.  Please keep in mind that we had waited to be seated too, once we were seated the waitress did quickly ask for our order but when we asked for a "few more minutes" we ended up waiting almost 15 to get her back to the table. The food was also slow to come out.  What I'm saying is that we weren't dilly-dallying and holding up progress. We were at the table a good 30 minutes with no food.  We had been at the table about 1 hr and 15 min when the "gentleman" essentially kicked us out. About 40% of that time was waiting on his restaurant to serve us. Two of us were still eating when he asked us to leave!   I understand that small restaurants need a turnover but there's a polite way to encourage your guests to finish up and there's this "gentleman's" way.  Both my brother and father, the two we were celebrating today, were disgusted by this "gentleman's" behavior and told me that they would never come back here.  A lovely meal ruined by a crabby ol' man with a sharp tounge.

Review Text :
So I had read good reviews on the other sites and one of my coworkers at another branch had indicated Z Pizza was good eats. When the location at Monroe and 1st Ave opened, I was very excited since it's just across the corner from my office. There are a few pizzas ready for by-the-slice options--all have proven to be very good. My boss ordered a salad and she liked it; however, as a rule of thumb I don't order salads as a meal. Overall, I really like the pizza, the setting is clean and appears to be efficiently laid out, and being so close to my work could get me in trouble (but that's totally my fault). With the weather cooling off, I'm sure their patio will see increased traffic.There are signs indicating beer and wine are on their way so that will be a plus.We're ordering from here today as an office meal, so I'll be updating with this experience.If you're in the downtown area, check out Z Pizza.O M G!! So today our main guy called in sick so we had to bring in another person who could fulfill his duties. It sounds impressive, but it's just a really cool title. So, anyway, this other guy, Patrick, decided to buy us all lunch on his corporate card. While I'm not one to take advantage of the company's hospitality, I was more than willing to forgo the Curry Chicken Sandwich I've had the past two time (flippin'' out of this world for a sandwich, with the bread slightly on the dry side but no soggies is a good thing) and opt for the calzone. Please, someone kick me in the nuts! Even though I had to wait an hour for my allotted lunch time and the calzone wasn't at its optimal temperature, I swear I leaked just a little during my first three bites. Oddly enough, I opted for the veggie version of this Italian classic which surprised one of my coworkers significantly--she thinks she's converting me to the meatless way of life but have I a different story to tell. Sun-dried tomatoes and artichokes melded with my roasted garlic sauce and mozzarella and ricotta cheese [in all fairness, I think the ricotta was added in error but I'm not complaining!]. While I'd normally take 45 minutes to finish any meal at work, this sucker was gone in under 15 minutes. :sigh: I almost needed a cigarette after that experience. Thank you, z-pizza, for allowing me to experience at work what only the bravest of souls have already--an orgasm.I have to give this pizza joint some credit. I've been coming to this place a lot, so it's time to give them my yelp review. This place is within walking distance from my apartment and I usually get their salads. Not the usual salads that you get from other pizza places. Salads here are different and a lot more creative. I usually get the Arugula and the Pear Gorgonzola which are both equally tasty, healthy and delicious. I also love that they have gluten-free crust and vegan ingredients. My niece can't have wheat, so having this option is important. I'm glad more and more places like this are serving gluten free foods. The slices of pizzas that have been sitting there are not that good though. Go build your own and have it freshly made. The Vegan pizza with gluten free crust is quite tasty and delectable. Prices are reasonable, establishment is clean and the staff is pretty nice. Overall, I have to give them 5 stars for having great prices for tasty slices, edible salads and the reasons I mentioned above!Heeeey, Z, Baaaaby, you know I didn't mean those things I said before.  I was exaggerating.  You know how I exaggerate.What had happened was......I wasn't feeling too good that day and took my foodie frustration out on you.  Baby, your service is on point.  That arugula salad was crisp and delicious with the candy coated walnuts.  The caaaandy cooooated waaaalnuts.  Caaaandy cooooated waaaalnuts.  I think you gave me extra didn't you?   Ummm hummmm.And the pizza was just how I like it.  You knoooow how I like my pie don't you?  Don't you?  Don't youuuuu?Puleeez take me back.  Z, I love you.

Review Text :
Last week, I drove by Villa Francesca, I said out loud, " I want that restaurant to have great pizza by the slice."  I tried it tonight and it was outstanding.  A fresh pizza came out of the oven and I ordered a slice.  I sat outside on a bench and ate my pizza. It was a little thicker than "thin" crust, topped with crushed tomatoes, fresh basil and mozzarella.    The owner came out and introduced himself and offered me another slice!!  It's good to be a girl!I don't think I want to eat pizza anywhere else in CLT.  My slice was $3.  The menu dinner items were $10-$15.  I can't wait to go back.  They are open on Sunday and outside seating.I almost didn't want to write this review and give Villa Francesca only 3 stars. I say this because our server was sweet and efficient, it's a very convenient location Uptown (not too bad to park) and I'm always on the prowl for tasty Italian. I'm clamoring to get back and try the 'za and I imagine that will likely take it up to the next level. I suppose that's what review updates are for!Inside, Villa Francesca is a roomy Italian resto with tables a plenty and booths large enough for the whole famiglia. This isn't super fancy pants Italian, and I kinda like it that way. The menu has all the classics: the parms, the pizzas, the pastas, the salads, etc. No doubt even the pickiest of eaters will find something to satisfy their hungry. I also imagine that this place is pretty good for kiddos as the portions are pretty generous and every kid I've ever known loves pizza.Anywho, I was in quite the mood for stuffed shells this particular day, so that's what I went for. The shells were good - a generous portion of four jumbo stuffed shells baked with a bit of cheese and covered in pomodoro sauce. While I enjoyed half and took the remaining home for a next day lunch, I kept comparing them to other stuffed shells I've had in Charlotte. The flavor of these was nice, albeit a bit salty, the shells were cooked well (a bit al dente) but it was the filling that I wasn't blown away by. The ricotta mix tasted a bit gritty...not creamy and insanely delicious like I'm used to. I know I'll be back to try some other items and I think I'll be much happier with the end result. The pizza looked huge and delicious, I'll need to hit that up. So, for now Villa Francesca, see ya later & ciao.

Review Text :
120 beers on the tap, 120 beers, take one down, gulp it down, 119 beers on the tap...you get the idea. The Yard House IS beer. But they also have 24 appetizers. 14 different starter salads and soups. Oodles and scads of burgers and sandwiches. Endless lists of steak and house specialty entrees. It makes The Cheesecake Factory menu look like a freakin' pamphlet. We arrived with a group of nine and were greated and seated by a friendly host staff. We opted for a table over a booth, cuz I ain't gonna be the bastard squished in the middle, drinking beer and having to get out 3 or 4 times to pee. We had just come from the Shamrock Foods show at the U of P stadium and had grazed on all things fried and anything you can stick a party toothpick in. So I was ready for a black and tan and perhaps a salad. Black and tan, both of them, went down quickly. I ordered the turkey cobb salad. And I got exactly that. Turkey was a tad dry, of course, when isn't it, and at $13.45, kinda pricey. Others had the mac n cheese, which was overwhelmed by the mushrooms. A BBQ chicken salad, that was, described as "Meh" (and no I was not with Pierre)...apparently though "Meh" is catching on like my current year motto "Make it great in 08"...well at least mine rhymes. Best dish on the table, not at the table, cuz that woulda been moi, but best dish on the table was a Korean rib appetizer. Server Christa was fantastic although frustrated as the runners delivered our meals and "auctioned" them off even though she had ordered them by position number. Music was all things 70s and 80s...The Outfield! What the hell happened to them?Located in Glendale this House is not in my back yard and that's OK with me.WHAT? I can't hear you!Grace? Died 30 years ago!Good luck conversing.I don't review many chains, but I am going to take a stab on this one.  Been meaning to check out a Yard House ever since Josh A's glowing endorsement on the Talk boards awhile back.  102 tap beers sounded right up my alley.  Didn't think I had ever been to one before, but it was pointed out to me that I was at one in San Diego in the Gaslamp Quarter a couple years ago.  Remember really having liked it.  Probably would have gone 4 or 5.  Low 3 on today's visit.The music was blaring loud this evening.  I'm sorry, but Matchbox 20 was not meant to be played that loud.  They are not even that good as background music.  I thought the waitress was going to kiss my mother on the lips as she was leaning in so close to hear the order.  Do they really think people like the music that loud?  Most of the customers were either parents with kids or gray-haired snowbirds.  No one was rocking out to it. Had two Uinta Hop Notch's which I have never seen anywhere else before.  Quite tasty.  The menu is very extensive both on beer and food.  Got the Mediterranean flatbread as an appetizer.  It was not good.  No sauce whatsoever, just toppings on crust.  Would have also been much better if the tomatoes were sun dried.  Would not get it again.The blackened swordfish tacos were pretty good.  Little light on the fish, but excellent flavor with a healthy dose of guacamole.  I would definitely get these again.  Also had a couple bites of the Vodka Shrimp Pasta.  Think I will get that the next time I go when they open at West End in St. Louis Park.  Hopefully, they will use the volume dial on the music more prudently.Whether in SoCal or Arizona, The Yard house  is never a let down! Plenty of beers on tap, including local AZ beers. Lots of people and good appetizers. After a few letdowns in the area with bars, this was the most fun of them all that night! Definitely will be back when I'm in the area.

Review Text :
This was a pleasant new find for me.  Armed with a Groupon, and accompanied by another couple, I knew nothing about this bistro except that it served Italian food.  So, I gave it a full gustatory workout to see what it might bring to the table.We opened with very good fresh Italian bread and Fried Calamari with peperoncini added.  This appetizer came with a mild Marinara Sauce, and my request for Lemon Aioli as an additional dipping choice was graciously accommodated without charge.  As for the Calamari itself, the rings were very good, somewhat better tasting than the tentacles.  Requested butter was quickly provided for the bread.   Italian Wedding Soup was very odd.  It contained spinach leaves as expected, but also cut carrots and a lot of white chicken meat.  I had to send it back, because it wasn't very hot and contained no meatballs as Italian Wedding Soup should.  The restaurant manager and co-owner who was making the rounds of tables agreed; normally included meatballs were missing from my bowl.  When it returned, the small meatballs were the best part, but I didn't like the included tiny tubular pasta noodles that much.The rest of the dinner soared.  A dinner-size classic Caesar Salad contained firm green leaves of Romaine Lettuce, crunchy croutons, and a good creamy Caesar Dressing.  The portion was generous and took awhile to finish.  The huge portion of Eggplant Parmesan that immediately followed was cheesy, saucy, and quite delicious--magnificent, and the best of its kind I have ever eaten.  My fellow diners were also pleased with their food.  A brick of Meat Lasagna and Veal Alfredo looked particularly appealing.There was no room or time for any dessert.  We had to dash off to the Cannery to arrive in time to see the last scheduled performance of "Red Tails" on its opening night.  I will sample Mezzo Italian Bistro's several dessert offerings on another day.Seating was comfortable in the cozy bistro, our servers were friendly, and service was good.  Dinner and the movie that followed constituted a fine night out!  A reprise will soon be in order.Armed with a Groupon, we headed to Mezzo - to a neighborhood we've never been to - to celebrate our anniversary.  I was impressed with the decor: trendy, but not too, nice bar (except for the ubiquitous TV, but only one), nice lighting, tablecloths covered with paper in true bistro style.We had truly great service; the music ( Frank, Dean, Tony - apparently a legal requirement at all Italian restaurants in Vegas -  with some newer stuff for variety) was a bit too loud, so it was turned down immediately at my request.  I was a bit chilly, so the heat was instantly raised.  Our drink orders were taken right away, and the food orders when we were ready.We shared a dinner salad, consisting of the usual suspects, with the addition of chickpeas and a dollop of ricotta for interest.  It would have been appreciated if the kitchen had separated it for us before it was served.  For entrees, my husband ordered his new favorite - chicken piccata - and was pleased with it.  I decided to go with the Tuscan Tenderloin, pork cooked in Chianti, served with apples in Prosecco, and asparagus.  The apples and asparagus were fabulous, as was the sauce for the pork, but the texture of the meat wasn't blowing me away.  I would have kept it, but when the waiter asked how our food was, I must have made a little face.  What happened next is the hallmark of a very good restaurant:  the owner came out, took the pork away and checked it in the kitchen where the light was better.  Long story short, he told me that I still wouldn't be happy with it if I had him make me a new one, and that I should choose something else.  Hubby's chicken looked very good, so I went with that.  But I kept the penne that had come with my pork, because it was perfectly al dente and sauced just right, so I had them hold the angel hair.  But I got my asparagus back, and it was sooo good!  The chicken had fresh capers, which really bump up chicken piccata several notches, and this one was a winner.We never order dessert, but since we were celebrating a whole decade of marital bliss, we decided to break the rules.  (And this after pigging out on the 30-day cruise we'd just come back from!)  Hubby wanted the cannoli, but I've never been a fan of them, so I convinced him to go with the cheesecake.  But the wonderful owner, Sean, brought him a sample of their cannoli, and man, if they all tasted like that one, I'd be eating them for breakfast:  big chocolate chips, chocolate sauce, so decadent my mouth is watering just writing this.  Ah, but the cheesecake was fabulous, too, a small round individual cake covered with fresh strawberries.  Rich and delicious, and all mine!  I could have scarfed down the whole thing, but my superego kicked in, and I managed to have it last for three nights. It's wonderful when a restaurant owner cares enough to make sure that you're satisfied with all aspects of the restaurant experience, even if you're there with a Groupon, and that makes all the difference.  It was great to leave with that feel-good feeling that makes you want to go back.Buckle up, Mezzo Bistro.  Here it comes.  I'd give you a ZERO rating, but since that isn't possible, you'll earn a completely undeserved one star.  10/30/2013, about 11:30 a.m.My wife and I go in for lunch, order a Caesar salad and two entrees.  The salad comes out, and to be honest, it's pretty good.  Then, my wife finds a PUSHPIN in her salad.  Are you f**king kidding me?  A PUSHPIN?  She spits it out (lucky - for you - that she wasn't injured), and I call the only staff member I can find over. (A blonde woman working behind the bar.)  We show this to her, and she quickly apologizes and goes back into the kitchen.  For a while.  My wife, visibly shaken, isn't really comforted by the half-hearted apology and disappearing act.  The woman eventually came back out and went straight behind the bar, obviously having no intention of speaking to us again.  No manager or chef came out to check on us either.  So we left.  BTW:  Y'all can keep the groupon voucher we handed her at the beginning of the meal - it's a pretty safe bet we're never eating there again.I don't know how the hell you have your kitchen and prep areas set up, but how the hell do you prep food anywhere near pushpins?  You didn't see any possibility that this could eventually cause a problem?  No?  I will say that this wasn't our first time there.  In fact, it was probably our 6th or 7th time in.  And all the other times, I left happy with my meals.  But never again.  I don't care how many good meals you serve, one "I-could-have-been-seriously-injured-by-your-carelessness and ineptitude" is all it takes.  I realize there's probably not much you can do to satisfy a customer that was one swallow away from spending the rest of the day in the ER because of your stupidity, but here's a tip:  DON'T RUN AWAY AND HIDE FROM THEM EITHER.  Way to run a business, guys. So go ahead and try your luck at Mezzo Bistro, people.  It is Vegas, after all, so if you feel like gambling with your life, knock yourself out.Another one that is beyond me on how it's rated so poorly. Quality fresh pasta, seafood, wine, good beers, pretty and clean restaurant with good service - yet people feel the need to rate it poorly? I wonder where they eat...A lot of people that seem to complain have coupons - not that I have anything against coupons, but they also complain about the prices. I cannot say this enough - you will pay higher prices for higher quality of food. Just because it's pricey, don't complain. You have other cheap options with more affordable prices. Don't walk into somewhere complaining about prices when you had the option to walk in. I will tell you this - the Penne with vodka sauce...probably the best I've had in town. It was perfect. The pasta was perfectly cooked and soft. The sauce was amazing. It was creamy, cheesy and you taste the vodka in it. Everything and more you could ask for in this dish. It tickled my fancy.We also had the meat lasagna. The marinara sauce with the cheese - positively delightful. Appetizer, we had calamari. It was served with peperoncini's and cooked perfectly. There homemade marinara sauce really is very good. Nice thick chunks of tomatoes and a really good strong basil flavor.The service was good and the server was super friendly and attentive.My problem with this place is the location. I don't think it'll reach it's full potential because it's hidden. Also, the crowd that would be more attracted to this place may be more in the Centennial area. I hope it does succeed though. I love to see anything that isn't a chain do very well and make it to where the other chains can't compete.Sorry to say that the one star belongs to Marisa, the most professional server, at Mezzo.  My family has enjoyed Mezzo in the past, several times. However, recently, on Veteran's Day, we were humiliated and disheartened.  We sat down to enjoy a dinner, with our Groupon, on Veteran's Day.  We were met by a most unprofessional wait staffer. She was abrupt and crudely remarked, in a heightened tone, that the Groupon was not accepted on Veteran's Day! What?  We read the Groupon aloud, indicating that there was no mention of Veteran's Day exclusion on the Groupon. Here, my husband, a Viet Nam Vet sits, with his Marine Corps shirt, and listens to the waitress coldly repeat-"No not accepted today!!"  I asked her to call for a manager, she never did, she just went to the back and retuned in two minutes and said that the Groupon is not accepted today.  I was ready to leave. Then she remarked, " It's up to the owner's discretion,  he said NO.  At the risk of having a problem and ruining the day, we ate and left.  We called Groupon Corporate immediately.  Groupon noted that Mezzo was wrong and the Groupon was supposed to be honored.I went back to Mezzos today, with my Groupon, and spoke to a manager and  one of the owners- Kelly Richards. After explaining my experience on Veteran's Day and having eaten dinner, they were both extremely arrogant.  They apologized for the servers behavior (chalking it up to a bad day), they repeated that it is up to the owner's discretion to use the Groupon and they DIDN'T ACCEPT GROUPONS ON VETERANS DAY!    Their nerve and arrogance is beyond words. He didn't even realize the level of his indifference and callousness.  He kept boasting about what he does for the community.  Well we have news for him, you show us no respect and dignity, and you will receive the same treatment in return.  How dare you be so rude to a veteran on Veterans Day, or at anytime!!  I hope all the vets that patronize your "mom and pop" business, get this message.  I will be sure to get this message out.  WE WILL NOT RETURN.  All vets should stand together and be aware of this treatment.Mezzo BistroThe Good, the Bad, and the Office SuppliesIt pains me to write this because I really liked this place, but Yelp is all about honest and useful reviews, right? Brace yourself.In the past two years have I visited Mezzo Bistro about five or six times. The atmosphere is nice, the food is really good, and the wine selection is pretty decent. I have always had a pleasant experience so why would this time be any different? Anticipating my next trip to Vegas, I bought a Groupon for $22 towards lunch because it was one of my favorite off-Strip restaurants. Was.Around 11:30am on 10/30/13, my husband and I went in for lunch. We ordered Chicken Parmesan, Chicken Piccata, and Caesar salads. The salads came out and the first couple of bites were delicious, as always. But then, without any warning, I bit down on something hard. Something crunchy and solid. I immediately spit it into my napkin and looked to see what the hell it was. A pushpin. I felt the blood drain from my face. Are you freaking kidding me?! A pushpin? In a salad? How does that even happen? Correct me if I'm wrong, but the manager's desk and everything inside it should not be anywhere near the food prep area. I don't even understand how that happened. It fell into the bowl and got mixed in with the lettuce and croutons? What the hell, people?!So I took a photo of it because there's no way anyone in the world would believe such a ridiculous thing could happen. My husband called the waitress over to show her what had happened. She seemed unimpressed. He then asked to speak to the manager. The waitress went in the back and talked to the manager, but when she came back out she went behind the bar and busied herself and ignored us entirely. Really? That's how you handle such a crisis? That's your customer service policy? To ignore it and hope it goes away? Wow.Fine. So we left the Groupon on the table and walked out. I was completely freaked out by that experience. That could have gone so badly, for me and for the restaurant. If I had bitten down on it the wrong way, or swallowed it, that was gonna be a bad day for everybody. My husband wrote a Yelp review later that day. He included the photo I took of the white pushpin. We all know businesses read their reviews online. To date, not one person, management, legal or otherwise, from Mezzo Bistro has contacted us. Unreal.This is the only bad thing I have to say about this restaurant. But it's a pretty damn bad thing. Dine at your own risk.Man, it seems that all of my favorites are going to crap.I've never been this disappointed in this place. I will admit, the service is always hit or miss.Last night, it was 100% miss.We've had this waiter a couple of times now, and he is horrible. We hardly get waited on, he constantly forgets about our drinks/dishes and he just doesn't seem to care. It's super frustrating.Last night, we had:Portebello mushroom - This is like soup. You have to eat it with a spoon or bread. Such an odd dish. The filet - it was good. Not the best I've had, but cooked a bit over what I had asked. The gorgonzola is super over porwering, so be fair warned.Sea bass special - this dish was not good at all. Super dry, tasteless and it didn't even taste like sea bass. If that was the first time we'd gone there, we'd never go back. They need to up their service an insane amount. They have 3 waiters that we get pretty often and they're horrible. We definitely have some amazing favorite dishes here, but it makes us not want to go just based on the service. We shouldn't have to constantly remind them of what they forgot to bring us or to get their attention just to order.Merh.I wanted to try something differen and this has been on my bookmark for a long while so I came for lunch with my mom and mother in law.They have a scaled down lunch menu until 4pm (according to their site). I ended up getting their chicken parmesan which was pretty solid! Crisp, not greasy and the sauce on it was homemade and had a nice balance. It was one of the better parms I've had in town. My mom enjoyed her chicken piccata thoroughly and I snuck in a bite and thought it was a solid choice too. My MIL got a sausage and peppers sandwich and really loved it because of their tomato sauce. It comes with a daily side which was a pasta salad she didn't quite like, but you can request for other sides too. My mom tends to over order so we got too many desserts. Creme brulee is bruleed tableside which was nice since you can customize how charred you like your sugar. Pizza fritta (or we call in zeppolis) was actually pretty good. If you like fried dough like beignets you might be into these too.  My mom took a cannoli home to my stepdad. Our server was one of the bartenders and he was super friendly and attentive. Great service. Based on our positive lunch experience, the MIL and I came back with my husband for dinner the following week. She got the chicken parmesan based on my positive review on it and she enjoyed it as well. The husband and I split the chicken marsala which was pretty yummy with a perfect sauce and a snapper special from the chaulkboard. Unfortunately, that snapper was way overcooked and had a pretty strong fishy taste to it. We rarely send anything back to the kitchen, but this was not something either of us felt comfortable eating. Maybe not the spot I'm gonna order a fish again, but all the other dishes have been cooked perfectly with juicy chicken. This time service was not as attentive and basic. The plus is that he took the fish back, took it off our bill without any issue, but we weren't checked on. The hubby ate off his moms chicken parm and the marsala and we almost finished the dishes off before we were checked on to even tell him about the fish and request some drink refills. We ended up getting the pizza fritta dessert again and a tiramisu. I haven't had a good tiramisu in a while and that was light with just enough coffee. Overall, solid place for some Italian in the northwest. Definitely would order the dishes we had over and over again (minus the fish). Check for groupons as well, I see them pop up fairly often.

Review Text :
On this occasion, I feel the Scottish movie-stereotype that usually makes me cringe kinda holds true. Queue on fat, Scottish bastard with his ginger hair and tartan cap saying "get in mah belly". (ref: Austin Powers). Ignoring the repulsive image of "Fat Bastard" himself, this is how I feel about The Baked Potato Shop, in the best way possible.Baked potatoes, or potatoes generally, are Scottish comfort food. It's cold here a lot. We eat 'street food' a lot. Eating street food, outside, can be tricky. And so the baked potato is the perfect solution for this. Crispy skin, soft fluffy centre, and a nice, fatty, mayo-drenched filling.Ok so they're never going to be the choice of the health conscious. But at The Baked Potato shop there are so many fillings, all of which are veggie, that you don't only have to have 1 of 3 traditional fillings (baked beans and cheese, tuna and cheese, cheese.)How about curried sweet corn? Or veggie chilli? Or spinach special? Or three-bean? Or greek feta? Or tofu? Or...oh I forget, there were so many. But basically, all the fillings are veggie and there are at least 10 - 15 options I think. And yes you could go for cheddar with full fat mayo, but there's also some much lighter and at least semi healthy options.Also, after asking the guy why the options were only veggie, he told me that it was originally founded by David Bann. That is, David Bann of the restaurant David Bann, one of the best vegetarian restaurants in Edinburgh - in fact something of an institution. This really impressed me. Apparently he founded in over 10 years ago, allt he fillings recipes are his originals, but he sold it on after 2 years. They kept all the recipes though.So, back to the Fat Bastard recipe. Picture me holding the 'small' portion in my hand with the curried sweetcorn filling, feeling the very weight of it in my hand thinking there is no WAY I would eat it all. 15 minutes later, I'm sitting on a wall on the Royal Mile, scraping spilling curry sauce off my leg (I'm a right proper Lady me), with an empty polystyrine box by my side, and a very happy little food baby, feeling the proud epitome of Scottish, fat-bastard-ness.In a word, The Baked Potato Shop is well good. Delicious baked potatoes, amazing fillings, three sizes (small = 1 potato. medium = 2 potato. large = 3 potato). Hot and cold fillings. Friendly staff. Did I mention that potatoes are just TOO GOOD? Yum.

"Grilled Shrimp Sweet Corn and Arugula Salad"Tried it. Bought it. Loved it. Bought it again. Resisted licking the plate.Best salad I have ever had in my life!! Seriously, who needs a boyfriend when you can have this salad?!!! The croutons give your taste buds a warm welcome. They are fresh, warm, and delicately seasoned. The spinach is lightly drizzled in dressing (which I think they should rename Heaven). The grilled sweet corn and cherry tomatoes give the salad a little euphoric touch putting all the other salads to shame. Finally, the star of the show: the Succulent, juicy, seasoned to perfection grilled shrimp...Oh.My.Gosh. Have you ever been in love? This salad will make you reconsider.

We pulled into Carolina Place mall and the smell in the air really got our attention. Such a wonderful smell blowing across the parking lot. We asked several employees where that amazing smell was coming from. Surely it wasn't coming from Harper's.... or could it be?  We have a Harper's in Columbia, but I've never smelled anything like this smell before coming from our location. Sure enough that smell was indeed coming from Harper's. As soon as we finished our shopping we just followed the smell on into the restaurant. They have a Brick Oven. We were immediately greeted and seated in a nice cozy booth for 2. The menu was a little limited but there were still plenty of choices. I had the Caesar Chicken Wrap and Grilled Asparagus. My husband had one of the Brick Oven Pizzas. He cleaned his plate.   The food was good and the service was good. This location is definitely better than ours.

Why hello dear friend!   How is darling Buffy today?  Good, good, so glad to hear she is recovering from that absolutely hideous pavement rash from the tennis court.  Dreadful!Jim W belong to a country club?  Perish the thought!  Jim W eat lunch at the country club restaurant, Bolero's, on a 2 for 1 coupon?  Certainly!I found the indoor dining area to be a bit stuffy and I might even venture perhaps a bit pretentious.  Perhaps.  Shall we take our lunch out on the veranda?  Quite so, indeed.  The view of San Tan Mountain is always so splendid this time of year.  Do say!The service was very good in an obsequious sort of way.  If you enjoy the feeling that you are being fussed over because you might be a big macher (look it up here: http://www.koshernosh.com/dictiona.htm) then you will get off on the service here.I opted for a cheeseburger and fries.  I was a little disappointed in the fries, thin, slightly coated and unremarkable.  The burger was very good.  The setting was very nice.OK, Country Club lunch, been there, done that.

8/16/13Great pizza place in sister's neighborhood!  My first visit here was a day shy of two years ago- I found a pic on my laptop of a Margherita pizza from here dated 8/17/11.  I remember thinking the pizza and calamari were great, and my spaghetti-loving sister enjoyed her selection, as well...Tonight, we ordered drafts of YuengLing (BIL) and Honey Brown (moi), a bottle of Corona (with a lime wedge; sis), and waters all around.  Our server Blair was kind enough to let me sample the Waterkeeper Hefeweizen (one of two specials on tap) and the HB http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/hawthornes-ny-pizza-and-bar-charlotte-10?select=XQX6OCUnFv9MacOAbwS-EQ#XQX6OCUnFv9MacOAbwS-EQ before I ordered a pint.  BIL ordered the other draft special, Dale's pale ale, but he didn't like it, so sis asked if he could switch it out for another.  No prob.  For food, we chose the calamari to start, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/hawthornes-ny-pizza-and-bar-charlotte-10?select=69xy3Q3NjSUTRomDOgDj4w#69xy3Q3NjSUTRomDOgDj4w and an 18" half-Elizabeth Special and half-Hawthorne's Special White, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/hawthornes-ny-pizza-and-bar-charlotte-10?select=1kmEdfAxtM0pjzYTyJHDMQ#1kmEdfAxtM0pjzYTyJHDMQ while nephew wanted the cheese pizza. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/hawthornes-ny-pizza-and-bar-charlotte-10?select=lJE9Ugy6CD9wFH-b92flcg#lJE9Ugy6CD9wFH-b92flcg  While I can't speak for my sister and BIL's usual pizza pick (Italian sausage, pepperoni, 'shrooms, green bell, white onions, mozz), sister and I LOVED the HSW, which had ricotta cream sauce, mozz, (lotsa!) pesto, and sundried tomatoes.  I really appreciated the thin crusts served here. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/hawthornes-ny-pizza-and-bar-charlotte-10?select=iSE_JGbw3nZ0Ks3CXN60Cg#iSE_JGbw3nZ0Ks3CXN60Cg  Sister already decided this combo is what they're ordering on their next visit.A great meal out almost always ends with something sweet, and I love tiramisu, so this was a must-try. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/hawthornes-ny-pizza-and-bar-charlotte-10?select=xGX1CO0Jfnq4qwe_WitiYg#xGX1CO0Jfnq4qwe_WitiYg  Sis ordered a slice of chocolate cake for my nephew. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/hawthornes-ny-pizza-and-bar-charlotte-10?select=fIgdOPFPCcLTquIoSyJzGQ#fIgdOPFPCcLTquIoSyJzGQ  They were BOTH absolutely amazing!  I like tiramisu that is rich in flavor-sweet mascarpone, but not cloyingly so, and rich espresso taste, no greasy mouth-feel, and not too light and fluffy, and this was perfect!  (I asked for the powdered sugar to be omitted.)  The chocolate cake is also a must-have!  It was a lot denser than the tiramisu-- almost flourless in texture, or at least the part I ate from was (the outer edge of the cake).  Too bad the busser threw out our take-out containers of sweet treats... They're pricey!  (Tiramisu was almost $6, and the chocolate cake was $8, but come to think of it, the cake slice was huge.)  I even labeled and dated them, but not even two minutes had passed when I thought I'd forgotten my phone and ran in to retrieve it, and our table had already been cleared, and the busser didn't even bat an eye.  We didn't notice that the desserts were missing until we were home.  Make sure you check the tab for accuracy!!p.s.  The Honey Brown lived up to its name, and I definitely preferred it after sampling the bitter hef, but the beer kept impressing me as I ate the calamari (awesome combo) and then progressed to the pizza.  I had my sister try the beer after each course, and she concurred.  I would order this again in the future!

Broken rice, broken bits,Broken grains, broken grist,Broken fragments, broken kernels,People eating the broken grains.Ain't no use jiving,Ain't no use joking,Every grain is broken.Fellow Yelpers Brian S and Donald SDined here with me on several platesAnd an appetizerThe service was strong,The atmosphere was nice,The food was very good,Nothing broke but the rice.Every last one, busted clean in half.I had a beef and shrimp paste plate,Served over broken rice,The appetizer we shared was spring rolls,With shrimp and other stuff,They were pretty fresh and tasty,I would go here again,I would eat the broken grain,The prices are pretty good,Your wallet won't be...broken.3/29/10Came here after work as Mom needed to do some light shopping at Mekong supermarket.  Since it was already 815p, she started grocery-shopping, while I placed an order for spring rolls, which Mom specially-requested, and a combination pho.  I've always wondered if the meatball dish was any good, so I ordered that, too.  In less than 10 minutes, our dishes were ready, so I texted Mom to come on over.Mom didn't really enjoy the fresh rolls- she only had half of one, and the other sat in the fridge for three days until I tossed it out.  We also didn't enjoy the meatball platter.  What a waste!  Terrible presentation (unflattering color- could've used some searing action to give the slices a nice crust), horrid texture (clammy/rubbery), and very bland in flavor.  Two bites, and I wondered who would ever order this again?  Not us!  Thankfully, the pho saved the evening!  That is, until it became quite clear, from the heightened energy levels of the cleaning crew, that they were anxious to close for the evening.  We were trying to eat as fast as we could, until I finally looked at my watch and noted it was only 8:45p!  What the...?  Then I remembered that the last time we were there, we were treated the same way, too, but it was understandable, since it was closer to 9p then.Sorry, Com Tam, but lackluster spring rolls, ghastly meatball dish, and rushing us when there was still plenty of time are two reasons too many not to come back!If your truly craving some true Vietnamese food then this is the place to go!! They offer such colossal portions and the service is wonderful too.    However, it honestly wasn't for me, not my kind of taste. But trust me if your a true Vietnamese food lover, then this is your place of food. It's also conveniently located in a plaza that has other small restaurants and a grocery store!!! ***** Have fun!!!******

Aucune critique en français à propos de Snowdon Deli? Honte à nous les francos!Je cherchais un resto à smoke-meat dans le coin, et voilà que Yelp m'indique cet endroit dont j'ignorais l'existence. Je peux y lire à son sujet beaucoup de critiques positives, toutes en anglais, et plusieurs photos de sandwich à l'aspect appétissant. Convaincu par les mots de mes confrères yelpeurs, j'entre donc dans ce resto situé sur le triste et délabré boulevard Decary. J'ai opté pour le sandwich traditionnel (un choix qui ne se retrouve qu'ici) et qui signifie une viande plus épicée qu'à l'habitude. Je n'ai pas regretté mon choix. Le gout d'épice était franchement plus prononcé sans être trop fort ou dérangeant. Les tranches étaient tendres et juteuses, sans ces morceaux de gras blanc que l'on retrouvent souvent dans d'autres resto. En bref, mon sandwich était parfait et gouteux comme je l'aime. L'ambiance? Il s'agit du seul point négatif. Néons blafards, décor défraichi, clientèle locale qui vous met un peu mal à l'aise (genre groupe de p'tit vieux qui se tait et vous dévisage à votre arrivée). Comme pour bien des restos Deli de Montréal, le décor et l'ambiance générale laissent quelque peu à désirer.  Le service est rapide, mais sans trop de sourire. En bref, Deli Snowdon est encore un resto qui offre un bien meilleur sandwich que Schwartz's. Je le dirais donc encore : éviter les files interminables de ce resto sur St-Laurent qui se prétend "incontournable" et venez ici. Votre expérience smoke-meat sera franchement meilleure.

Oh. My. Gawd. This place redefined my definition of a sub. Before coming here (subs just aren't big in Australia), all I knew of submarines was Subway - now, I'm not sure I'll be able to eat that swill ever again.This place is a Montreal institution, just look at the other reviews. Don't be fooled by the word 'pizza' in the name - you want the sub. Just the sub. Which sub? I'm glad you asked...Repeat after me: "14 inch number 15, please". That's the Manzo's Special. When I went with my friend (and Yelper Extraordinaire) Matthew P. I asked if I should get two different subs (one for me, and one for my girlfriend), you know, to try things out. His answer was an unequivocal "No. Get two Manzo's" and boy was he right. I could've eaten both on my own, but my girlfriend would've killed me.Do yourself a favour, next tim you want a sub, go to Manzo's. You can thank me after.The Holy Grail of SubsStep 1Order 14 inch, number 15 Manzo special.  (I know what your thinking. "oh that's too much for me, I could never!". Trust me you can, and you will get on your knees after you've devoured it all begging for more.)Step 2The hardest step  Wait patiently.Step 3Carefully transport the warm, divine "Manzo" to your feasting place of choice.  Plant both feet on the floor, lift with both hands and brace yourself.Orgasmic. You may need a smoke after your done. Oh and I told you you would beg for more. Delicious. Fuggedaboutit'

Famous Dave's is always good when nothing else sounds good.  It isn't super fancy or special, but it gets the job done when you want some traditional American BBQ quick!The menu is diverse and has a lot of American favorites on the menu from BBQ beef, pork, and chicken, burgers, fish options, and even salads.  My favorite items are the BBQ pulled pork and the catfish fingers.  YUMMY! I will almost always get one or the other almost every time I visit a Famous Dave's.  Hey, I know what I like!  They also have some great side items to add to your meal.  The spicy mac n' cheese is quite a highlight and delightful, if I do say so.The desserts here are really pretty good as well.  My favorite new dessert is the Banana Pudding dessert.  It is really, really good!  I have to admit that it is at least as good or maybe even better than my mom's Banana Pudding.  Yummy for your tummy!I also have to give props to Famous Dave's because they have Sweet Tea!  It is so hard to find Sweet Tea out West, so whenever I do, I am all over it like white on rice.  I love me some Sweet Tea!  Yummy!Overall, the food here is good, the service is good, and the price is low.  If you just can't decide what you want to eat, you know you can find something good at Famous Dave's.

As I tell you this incredible  story of this restaurant this evening consider this ...                       Would you want to dine at a place that could care less about the value of "every single" customer?"                      Would you dine at a place that all they care about is how many people they can get in and out of the door?                      Would you dine at a place that would lie to you about reservations or tells you a different "story" about the reservations when you get there?Even after you spoke with them earlier that very day? OF COURSE you would not!                        Makes me wonder with this Walmart Attitude( who cares about you there is plenty more coming in the door) for the diner what about the food? Seems like this would certainly carry over. I mean if you could care less about the diner then you could care less about the preparation of the Food!                         To make a long story short about a month ago I called this place for reservations for a Unofficial YELP event I spoke with the Kitchen manager I told him the number of people the time and date his reply" No problem just give me a call the day of to see if you can give him a more accurate number " Sorry never been to a restaurant that after you made reservations they wanted " YOU" to call them back to make sure of the number.I have had restaurant call to confirm my reservation never anything about numbers of people.                           So I get there this evening and first they acted like I did not have a reservation for our group then with a painful conversation  " it" was decided that I did WHAT? I called you about a month ago and then today! So a new seemed like untrained and inexperienced  manager ( Maybe she should go back to Burger King hopefully she was a better manager there)came up and explained" You have to wait until at least have your party comes before we can seat you?"                          I reminded her that I set this up a month ago nothing was said about this and called today and nothing was said about it I told her there was about a 1000 places to dine within a 20 mile radius and we could have went to any of those had we knew this was going to be like a ROOT CANAL !!!                           She left and she said" Let me check on your table " after about 20 minutes she never came back. I told the 14 hostesses that we will go else where and left .                            So Would you go to a restaurant like this? NO ! I have had less reservation problems with having a birthday party at Chucky Cheese!                Cheddar's TERRIBLE !!!Please YELP can we add another rating or two?? And this could be one of the two " What are you thinking??? Dr Phil where are you?" Or Gordon Ramsey  there is this place that I would like for you to try" I would laugh for hours!!!!!!! Just thought I would add a update... after speaking to a few people in this corporation with many apologizes I was asked to return" Against my better judgment"   and was told that" it would not be the same" we are going to retrain everyone! After a few days of thought and the statement " just let us know when your coming"      I kept thinking why let them know that I am coming?For what special treatment? THAT WOULD BE A NO!  So they could really cook ? No AGAIN!  So, I thought I would call their bluff I called the Corporate guys( I think the owners of the franchise) and with a very short fuse I told them I was coming back .      Just as I thought I was sent a message can you give us a "little more time" for what? Are they closing the restaurant to retrain? That would be a NO?         So ask your self this the next time you go into a restaurant or you like to gamble and go to Cheddars what did they cook? I always gauge a restaurants quality by the size of its Sysco or other Food company's  Monthly bill!! The hirer this is the less they cook! And if the value of the customer is any sign how they value the care they take with your meal then take 3 shots of Cabo and call me in the morning.

Review Text :
Definitely gonna eat here whenever im in the area!As long as these guys have been here im surprised there are only 31 reviews for this place. Hopefully another positive review will get these guys some more attention. They are kind of tucked away behind McDonalds next to David's Bridal in nice sized plaza.As you walk in you will notice the place is bit small. What you will also notice is the giant menu that is on the wall complete with pictures and all items are individually numbered. So ordering is very simple. The only hard part is deciding what to get because you have a lot of choices.The times that I have been here I have ordered the Chicken and Beef Combo which comes with Miso Soup, Tempura, Salad, and California Rolls. Other times I have ordered nothing but appetizers like their Spicy Tuna Roll and Soft Shell Crab. From this point I am firmly convinced that it doesn't matter what you order here. My assumption is that it will be awesome! Heck my wife was curious about their Udon and tried it. She loved it! Prices are very good for the amount of portions you get. Usually, me and my wife share a combo meal and add a side of something. That fills us up guaranteed!Service  is awesome! It is run by nice family and every time we come here, they are very friendly!So, if you are thinking of going to the buffet at Palace Station or McDonalds, make your way here instead. Your stomach will truly thank you later!I didn't expect to love this place, I was just looking for something quick, fresh, easy, and new (to me). This was one of the few spots in the area to fit the bill. I have a feeling I'll be there regularly.BENTO BOXES: Good for lunch or dinner, but more fun to dine in for the presentation. Kalbi option available if you're not a teriyaki fan.UDON: Available with shrimp tempura or plain, with various combos. Wish the broth was a bit more flavorful but the noodles are perfectly chewy, like springs for your teeth.COMBO SPECIALS: AKA enough food for two people under $10 if you get the large. Kalbi + chicken katsu is my go-to, served with a feast of sides (rice, mac salad, 4 pieces crunch roll, soup, and salad). If you're broke til payday, this meal will last days AND be relatively healthy.SUSHI: ~20 basic and special rolls, several with similar combinations of ingredients (like the Jessica and the Cactus). Tightly rolled with fresh fish and not too much rice. All rolls under $10, wish there were more unagi options.They also have a bunch of apps and sides (spam musubi!), plus fried rice and tempura. Service is friendly and fast, location is more of a grab-and-go joint, as there are only four tables and they're pretty cramped. Small cooler of Hawaiian sodas and other beverages at coutner. Location is directly behind the McDonalds, difficult to see from the street.

Review Text :
Who let the dogs out? I counted 35.  They're everywhere including online (their website is thedogsonline.co.uk). All kidding aside , The Dogs dishes up some incredible Scottish comfort food.Located in and old Victorian walk up in New Town, this small, eclectic, homey space with its miss matched dishes and glasses provides the perfect backdrop to a meal of comfort foods.   Stateside Yeeps think of the bistro in the arts or university district of your favorite city.Straight to it, the haggis. Don't cringe, it sounds worse than it really taste. Extremely flavorful, light livery flavor, chunky and simply delicious. The accompanying potato and cranberry hash adds a creaminess  to the dish. Mixing the fried duck egg yolk and the whiskey sauce with heavy Scottish cream makes the flavors explode.  You'll sit up and beg for more.The ox shin, barley, beer pie is outstanding. Well braised pieces of ox shin in a heavily extracted beefy soup with a hint of sour bitterness from the beer pairs perfectly with the barley and root vegetables. Dipping the buttery, flaky crust into the broth is an added enjoyment. A true tail wager.The only questionable flavor came from and Asian inspired duck confit. While the duck was perfectly cooked and the accompanying salad in prune vinaigrette delicious, the dish seemed a mismatch to the other classics on the menu.Finally for dessert, a warm, creamy toffee rice pudding topped with crisp, deep-fried honeycomb and dark chocolate.  Great texture and flavor With complexity from honey. Sweet but not cloying. I definitely rollover for this.Short and very well chosen list of beer and wine. Very reasonable pricing.Extremely friendly and welcoming service.Overall a great value with most dishes less than 7£.Sit, stay, heel, speak, shake, jump, rollover, play dead. When it's this good, why not. Woof woof.

Review Text :
I often hesitate to order pasta at an Italian restaurant, thinking that I could easily do a decent pasta job at home myself. And then I had Santa Lucia's linguini alle vongole with white sauce. I take my food reviews seriously so believe me when I say nobody... yes... nobody in Montreal could make pasta sauce that unforgettable. It just has that 'wow' factor that makes you start planning your next trip before you even finish the dish. Proof: I've been going there and ordering the same dish in the last five years. So there, 'nuf said.PS: the place looks like someone's outdated living room, so if 'hip' is what you're looking for, this isn't it.

I actually worked here briefly during university so I can give you the inside scoop on this place.It's run by a guy named Dino who owns a few other restaurants, but essentially, it's a pretty independent establishment which should be an up since it's always nice to support the littler guys.Their food is actually pretty good considering that at heart this is a university sports bar. All of their chicken is fresh, never frozen. Their stir fry's were my favourite menu items.They have a great patio with televisions, high top tables, and if you can time it right you might also be able to snag a few of their comfortable lounge chairs.Inside there are booths with individual televisions, a bar area with high top tables, a party room that accommodates sports teams and a big screen television with tables in front of it for all the big games, fights, etc.

Review Text :
Finally, I made it to Ocean Prime...I'd been wanting to try it for months, and Saturday night it finally happened.  We couldn't get a reservation since it was Restaurant Week, but we took our chances and found the perfect spot at the bar.  Natalie, the bartender / server was awesome... I'd go back again and again to hang with here at the beautiful bar if only it wasn't so pricey or if the food was deserving of the prices... not exactly the case.Jared went for the three course Restaurant Week menu.  For $29, he had their house salad, a 7 oz filet, and sorbet for dessert.  I didn't find anything on that menu quite as appealing as the Chilean Sea Bass off the regular menu, so I splurged and went for that despite the $32 price tag.  I also ordered a side of steamed broccoli for $8.We were offered fresh bread but declined it... our wedding is just a few weeks away, so no need for extra carbs!Jared's salad came out pretty quickly and he shared a few bites with me - we were off to a good start - we cleaned the salad plate!  Next up, Jared's filet arrived with my side of broccoli.  The server who delivered it put both plates in front of Jared and said "anything else I can get you?"  We both answered at the same time "just my (her) sea bass."  He then went to check on it.Ten minutes later, my sea bass came out.  It looked good but when I went to cut into it, it was tough.  Now, I've had my fair share of sea bass - it's my favorite fish.  I've never had tough sea bass before.  Needless to say, we sent it back.Just as Jared finished his meal and we finished the broccoli together, the GM, Walter, came by to apologize.  He told us they were preparing a fresh piece of sea bass for me.When he asked if he could bring me anything else, I said sure... (I really wanted to try the glazed carrots).  It was awhile, but my new sea bass came out awhile later, as did the glazed carrots - and both were tasty.  Not amazing, but good.  Lucky for us, they ended up comping my sea bass and carrots.  Jared's lemon sorbet was served after I finished up... it was a generous two scoops.So, what would have cost around $100 on a typical night was half the price due to the *off* sea bass.  Would I do it again for full price?  Probably not... but if someone else is footing the bill, sure - I'll give OP another shot.9/19/11Came in for Ocean Prime's $40 Restaurant Week deal.  I've never been to OP, but I went in thinking I'd try the seafood.  However, after looking over my very limited choices (two seafood choices, $24 to $27, and steak), and at the suggestion of the server, I ordered the filet mignon ($32) , w/ the first course of side salad.  I arrived at around 15 minutes to 7p, but by the time I was seated by a host, served water, offered food and wine menus, greeted by the bartender, and then met my server, it was just past 7p, and I'd missed happy hour, which ended at 7p.  I was told that I could order happy hour apps at the discounted rate, but not the drinks.  I decided to forgo apps and alcohol and ordered my meal.I really liked the atmosphere at the lounge area (dinner seating next to the bar), even though it was a little too dark for my liking.  I felt that the room should've been a little smaller to match the intimate setting, but whatever.  Besides two couples, a lone diner, and me, the room was empty.  Outdoor seating looked inviting.  As I started to relax in this dark space, I decided to try the Strawberry Smash, realizing just minutes before receiving my table check that the drink would not be offered at the happy hour price of $7!  At $12, it was just a tad pricey, but considering the atmosphere, it was not bad.  (Honestly, I was expecting a lot worse!)  I'd definitely come back for happy hour!I was getting hungry, and it was almost 7:30p, so I asked if complimentary bread was offered (yes!) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tSJTbxhAO1tJMSdeTCiZwg?select=7_-HKOKCU89N1xGIymWorg.  The sourdough roll that appeared seemed a bit too small, but again, whatever.  It had a nice bite, and it came w/ whipped butter.  My cocktail http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tSJTbxhAO1tJMSdeTCiZwg?select=ZJNXrNmhMWUDKJU5PJzC2A was simply delicious!  Just sweet and tart enough for me not to notice the potency of the alcohol within- perfect!  Side salad http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tSJTbxhAO1tJMSdeTCiZwg?select=c0OWt3dKEA311b6sPgy-DA was nicely portioned, and tasted great.  Loved the combo of goat cheese, tiny bits of walnuts, and tart Granny Smith apples.  Had to forgo the mustard vinaigrette due to an allergy, but the sweet house dressing (wine-based w/ "lots of sugar") was good, if not a bit too sweet.  A taste of this dressing was enough.  The filet mignon (medium temp.) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tSJTbxhAO1tJMSdeTCiZwg?select=_zUDU5iVZaQWfXp_Im1s5w was tiny, but cooked to perfection!  The roasted garlic was buttery and potent and complemented the potatoes.  However, I would never pay $32 for a 5 oz. steak, with only the roasted garlic on the side!  Never!  Last, I had the creme bruleehttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tSJTbxhAO1tJMSdeTCiZwg?select=WucqsiKbTkzmz7X2huxBxg w/ berries.  I really enjoyed this dessert!  Very creamy and perfect in its texture, and the berries meshed nicely against the vanilla custard.  I'd have liked a bit more berries, so I stole the drunken strawberry from my cocktail and had it with a scoop of the brulee... ahh!!  My one complaint w/ the sweet dish?  The sugar coating was VERY thick!  It had to be about a quarter of an inch thick!  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tSJTbxhAO1tJMSdeTCiZwg?select=CMfhGJdpG66djDTo35SNiw http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tSJTbxhAO1tJMSdeTCiZwg?select=Oct9Oo6WCdzZg3hzYHGnGw Most of the brulees I've had had crusts just thick enough to muster a cracking noise when you lightly tap it w/ a spoon.  I definitely had to give this a few wallops.  Not very classy for such a "dainty" dessert...Overall, a nice experience, but certainly not worth the $68 (tip included) I splurged on dinner for one...

Review Text :
We've been fairly disappointed with the Indian food in the Charlotte area, so we stopped in to Nirvana with low expectations. We left with a new go-to place for Indian. AtmosphereThe atmosphere is slightly upscale, though it's comfortable enough for jeans and a nice shirt. Nice Indian music was playing and we had a comfortable booth by the window. The place is smallish, in a typical plaza storefront box, but done very nicely. ServiceWe received service on par with other Indian restaurants I've been to. That is to say, it was everything you need and nothing more. I'm a fan of this, as I am there to eat and not chit chat with an overzealous waiter. FoodPerfect. Everything was delicious. Rich sauces without being too rich. Buttery Naan bread without being too buttery. Filling without being too heavy. Complex layers of flavor that make you think that Indian chefs are magicians more than chefs. We had the Naan bread where you get to pick 3. My favorite was the fruit and nut Naan, it was like a mildly sweet dessert. Everything was perfectly cooked and stunningly delicious. My wife and I ordered 1 appetizer, 1 meal and the Naan, and left full and had enough for leftovers.CostWe found it to be a bit more expensive than other Indian restaurants in the area, but well worth it for the increased quality and taste. If you are in the Ballentine area (slightly north?) it's a great place for a fantastic dinner.Celebrity most likely to enjoy eating here: Tina Fey. She would butcher the names of the food but she'd eat it like there's no tomorrow.  Half hour to live and I have to get my last meal here: I'll just tilt my head back and you can cram as much malai kofta in there as possible.

Review Text :
This will be my new lunch time hangout!  The Lodge has a nice variety of food.  Something for everyone.  We had Potato skins as an appetizer with a terrific cheese dip.  For lunch we had a  Viena Polish Sausage with caramelized onions, taco salad and chef salad and fries.  Everything was great.The service is fast and friendly.  I love the atmosphere.  It reminds me of a fishing lodge in Canada or Alaska.  Very comfortable, TV's on the wall and a pool table and couches in the back.  The music is eclectic, playing one great song after another from many eras and genres.  Just a great place to hang out!The prices are very reasonable as well.Already looking forward to my next visit!!!!Four of us ended up here for dinner last night. My first impression of this place was weeks ago, late night, for a quick drink. I enjoyed dining here better...The atmosphere is dark and lodge-like, and I like it. The food is basically above average pub-grub and an excellent value for Scottsdale. Drinks were stiff and service was brisk. We stayed for a couple hours before heading to a birthday party at Drift which is just a few steps from The Lodge, as are a dozen bars and clubs. I think this is a great way to start a night out on the cheap.A ski chalet/mountain lodge on a flat corner lot in the heart of the club scene in little old Scottsdale, Arizona. That's what The Lodge is...does it work for you?I don't know...it doesn't really work for me.I come from ski chalet and mountain lodge-ville, originally...I have spent so very much time in them, so I kinda know whereof I speak:)When you walk into a log cabin up there, it really is a log cabin, not a remodeled First Watch (with stucco on the outside and faux log's for wall treatments inside...BTW, as a side note, The Lodge must have bought all the mints from First Watch when they took over...exactly the same mints on the way out the door:)And finally, when it's 102 in the shade, pretty much the last place I want to be is in a "cozy" log cabin...that's a place for warming up après ski, by the big fire, drinking beer and schnapps' until your long underwear melts:)The whole feel is a just a little off...like sushi at Houston's (no, I'm never getting off that one:)I needed lunch today and I thought about trying The Lodge. The last time I had lunch at a place with the word "Lodge" in its name, it was halfway down one of the back runs at Park City...it was also 5 degrees with a dry, powdery snow falling.It's a brisk 85 today in Scottsdale...certainly a cold snap for this time of year, so I thought "what better way to warm my bones than a visit to my local ski lodge":)I was going to try to schuss over to The Lodge, but my ski's are in storage, so I bundled up and walked over.The Lodge has a reasonable menu...in fact the menu is an awful lot like the menu at that little lodge off McConkey's Chair at Park City...burgers, sandwiches, salads, etc.I ate at the bar and had a Chicken Club sandwich that was OK, along with string fries and a drink for $9.75, not including tip (BTW, the service was very good at the bar and I tipped generously:).So the prices at The Lodge are way better than buying a chicken sandwich in Utah...I don't think I got out of that place for less than $20 for lunch for one...what are you gonna do...it's cold, you're hungry and they are the only game on that part of the mountain:)I understand the prices are even better at happy hour...good for them:)All in all, The Lodge is really pretty average, in terms of food and service...they are fine...just fine.I don't know how the concept of mountain lodge will finally play out in a desert town, but I know where to head when the snow flies this winter:)I'd been to The Lodge before on a few occasions for drinks but last night after the OYE was the first time I actually ate there... and I really did eat there - I went for it; I splurged; I ordered a big fat burger and sweet potato fries!I like the atmosphere at The Lodge much better than the clubs in Old Town.  It's not pretentious and I don't feel like you have to be dressed up to go there; it's a more casual kind of place.  Warm and even cozy... sure, it's more of a guy's place but they are not lacking in the female department - they've got plenty of chicks that hang there too - some of them may be getting paid by the hour, but they are still there.I was happy to see a ton of yelpers hanging out when I made my way over to The Lodge last night just after 9pm.  And I was starving, so I put in my order right away... and like I said above, I went for a burger and fries instead of my typical salad.  Unfortunately, I didn't get the burger I ordered.  I requested a burger (cooked medium) with no cheese but with lettuce, tomato, and fried onions.  Instead, I received a burger with cheese, bacon, and who knows what else... but I was so starving that I ate it all and I really enjoyed it too!  And those sweet potato fries?  Yum!Whether you're up for a drink or two, or to splurge on a burger and those sweet potato fries... The Lodge is a great alternative to the Scottsdale scene.  I just hope that next time they get my order right!The Lodge is the manliest of manly bars. And when I say manly I mean, Midwestern manly, put on your camo's and trucker hat, pack up your PBR, jump in the F150 and head out to set up post and shoot some f'n deer... type of manly. There are stuffed animal carcasses and heads everywhere, chandeliers made out of elk antlers, carved wooden bar stools and bears (ahem Adam W.. carved wooden bear alert!) and tree logs used in every way possible to decorate. I think there was also a fire place, but I was so fascinated by the post taxidermy coyote that was posing so mysteriously on the mantle. I guess its because anything dog related I am gravitated to.. either way, its always interesting looking at something so close that you've never seen before. That or I'm 5 years old. Another type of manly is that they use grilled cheese sandwiches as the BUN for a burger my friend ordered. Seriously,  a hamburger patty with all the fixings in between 2 grilled cheese's. Maybe this isnt manly, aside from the ability to be able to devour that much food..  so maybe its just ungodly fatty and unhealthy. Anyone participating in the "Fat Off" should not come here to eat. At all. And anyway I tried that burger, and it wasn't the shit. However, I did enjoy the criss cut fries and their ranch dressing is to die for. I need the recipe now. I crave that flavor.Its an interesting location for a place like this to be.. hidden among the trendy brodeo joints that I avoid like the plague. I liked the rustic feel this place had, and felt like drinking my Makers on the rocks was completely acceptable in a place like this. I don't care if its an 85 year old man drink, I love it and no one at the lodge looked at me like I had 10 heads when i ordered it, like everyone else does at most places I go. Plus Its got an extremely decent outdoor patio area fully equipped with heat lamps for those brisk desert evenings. Waitresses are nice, and cute which is always a plus, and the bathrooms didn't make me gag. So bravo. I don't see this place as becoming a regular stop while in Old Town, but I wouldn't mind going again. They have a super happy hour thing going on.. $3 beers, half price apps, $6 burger & beer.. cant beat that, plus  I love log cabins, and this place certainly reminded me of just that!I have been to The Lodge on several occasions, but was reluctant to write a review before I had tried some sort of food item. Beer is pretty much the same everywhere. This was the chosen spot for the post-OYE hang out. Like Nikki F said, this is definitely a man's man bar. There are stuffed cadavers of all sorts of fured and feathered animalia. Obviously by the name they are trying to give you that ski lodge/cabin feel. They have accomplished just that. There were lumberjacks and snow bunnies everywhere you looked. Well, maybe not, but you could picture them. Dallas G and I each got the black bean burger and I'll be damned, it was tasty! Lettuce, tomato,and onion topped the patty. I will say it could use avocado or something, but still good. Tater tots accompanied the burger on the plate. Oh, how tater tots harken back to a simpler time when all you were worried about was whether or not the next GI Joe or Transformers cartoon would be on after school. I think Amber W had some sort of salad, but I wasn't really paying attention.Interesting side note. Two very attractive and scantily clad women were chatting up two Tony Soprano look alikes at the bar. Now, I am not judging these two women, *however*, they appeared to be "on the clock". These guys were not that charming and they certainly weren't that good looking. Brady K and Jared M both confirmed my suspicions.So check out The Lodge. You may just see a hooker.I must be a snobby snobby bitch. Nope... just sober.Trust me, I tried to remedy that as quickly as possible so I could deal with this place. We were there on a Saturday evening around 9. Maybe it's okay as a Sunday day drinking spot but I'll never know,  because I'll never be back.Long story short:I came uncomfortably close to getting into a physical altercation with a man. Yes, all 112lbs of me and some of you will be surprised that I was not the instigator. I was NOT. You know that look.... that certain "sociopath" type look that serial killers have; the eyes are set a little too close together and their head slightly resembles a loaf of bread, pinched in at the temples. Well that's this guy....annnnnnd all of his equally roided out homies. The experience was actually scary and I don't scare easily. "Killer" wasn't the only reason for the sour taste in my mouth. The place was a little campy/cheesy and not really in the way I like. I can't really put my finger on it but it just wasn't my thing. The service was slow but the place was packed to the gills with every ass clown on the planet, so I'll cut them some slack there. We wanted to eat but there was no place to sit, as any of the open tables had reserved signs on them. Oh........reallllly, bottle service anyone? LAME I'm not sure if that was the case or not, it just seemed douchey and try hard. ShockingI will say one thing. This experience and the few others that I've had leading up to it have made me come to terms with something very special. I don't belong here and by here I mean Scottsdale. Unless of course someone would like to take me to City Hall for a sexy steak dinner. That's my idea of a good time. I doubt highly I'll fear getting punched in the face at Mastro's. Fuck I'm old....This is the exact place I love to hate. But I can't. I cannot hate you, Lodge. I just can't!In fact, if this place didn't have taxidermied animals (yes, I just made a word up) and antler headpiece things as chandeliers, I would probably be giving this place 5 stars....... I KNOW! I can't believe it either!!My first experience with The Lodge was as Yelp Bachelorette. I was hammered (give me a break; it was the most important day of my life so far) so I didn't think it was fair to review after not really "being there," if you know what I mean.My second experience was last night with THE Bachelor himself, Dallas G. Yet again, the staff was incredibly friendly, quick with the service, and willing to accommodate my vegan, gluten free existence without fault. They have an amazing black bean veggie burger and orgasm inducing sweet potato fries.  DG could learn a thing or two from those fries.Just Kidding. Now, here is the BEST part of all: THREE DOLLAR SKY VODKA DRINKS FOR THE LADIES.You don't need to know the rest.Stuck in Scottsdale but yearning for that lodge fire and hot spiked cocoa on a cool mountain air evening? You can either find a way to drive to Flagstaff or cab it to the Lodge and be whisked away to the imaginary world of mountainside living. When the Lodge first opened, I was a little confused. Why would Scottsdale think they could pull off a lodge when it's 100 degrees so many months out of the year? Who would want to hang out in a lodge? Then, I walked into the lodge and I was immediately mesmerized but its charm. I don't care if its 50 or 120 degrees outside, there's something adorable about the Lodge and I visit time after time. It's cozy, cute, reasonably priced, full of good food and has a whole slew of games to choose from. In the front room, groups can sit and watch the game on the big screen or catch up while they eat and drink. In the main area, visitors can stand around with the bar goers and be "Scene" for the night without being too scene. And if you are in the game mode, head back to the most lodgy room in the building where they have Big Buck Hunter, pool tables, darts, and other random games. And then they went and did something glorious. They added a patio to the Lodge so when the weather's nice, folks can sit outside and play Giant jenga or bags. I can hang out at the Lodge for hours and be content. The food at the Lodge is actually good. It's the kind of food where I actually eat there when I haven't had too much too drink. You can't say that about many bars in Old Town. Have you tried the potato skins? They aren't your average skins. They are crunchy and you dip them in the cheese queso dip. To-do-for and you probably gain five pounds immediately following. The TLTA is a favorite as well. It's honey roasted turkey with a creamy aioli and fresh avocados on crispy bread. Their cottage cheese is some of the best out there because it's spicy but not really spicy and has red peppers in it. I also enjoy their chicken sandwiches, burgers and of course the sweet potato fries. Throughout the year, the Lodge will host a variety of events in their parking lot. I've been to a skateboarding one and a surfing one. Yes, surfing! They are always a blast and worth the money. So when people are looking for a fun way to drink the day or night away or have a American meal, I suggest the Lodge. Well done Lodge. Can you clone yourself around town?Before I went to visit Scottsdale for the first time, people told me that I'd be heading into the Marina of Arizona. For those of you who are unfamiliar, the Marina is a young, social neighborhood in San Francisco where recent college grads and polo shirts run amok and where I spent some wonderful years after my own college graduation. After visiting the fair city of Scottsdale and especially after my time at the Lodge, I wholeheartedly agree with this comparison, but it's not necessarily a bad thing. And one thing that the Lodge has over the bars in the Marina is a very important thing: the drinks are CHEAP. In fact, the night I went there they were offering 20 oz of any beer on tap for a measly $5. For that kind of steal, I'll deal with baseball caps, polo shirts and low-cut jeans for days!If the lodge didn't over charge my card 3 visits in a row, I would recommend this place. Instead I have to expose them for the repeated credit card errors they have made! Maybe this will force them to hire some honest servers, but probably not! This has also happened to two of my other friend several times as well... very disappointing. This past Saturday, We went to the lodge at about midnight for some late night snacks we ordered $30 worth of food and drinks. My friend and I split the bill (So about $20 each after tip).  She messaged me today to see if I was billed for the meal, because her card was charged $30. I checked my account and they charged me $40, and these were posted charges, not pending!!  This has happened too many times and every time I have to call several times to dispute it, and a manage never happens to be around.  At this point I'm convinced that their servers do this intentionally in hopes that people will be too drunk to remember what they did or leave their receipts behind, so they can't dispute it.  Well I definitely was NOT drunk and I know I was ripped off.  You have lost a customer because of your bad business practices and dishonest servers.The Lodge is located on Douche Boulevard, just off of Bimbo Lane and around the corner from Boob Job Square. There are times when I've come here and had a great time, played some games with friends, wasn't perturbed by Douchey McDouche-tards and drank some cold beer. But then.I was here last night and arrived before my friend. The bar area was full, so I had to take a seat at a table. And then waited. And waited. And come the F on! Fake Boob Job Waitress, I know you see me sitting here! And just because I'm not a table full of dudes pretending that my fat is really muscle, I would still like to purchase a damned drink. For serious. I finally get my drink order taken and delivered (after she flirts some more with the pudgy dudes across the way), I continue to wait for my friend. Like magic, as soon as HE arrives, she appears almost instantaneously to take his order. Whatever.I very seriously doubt I would come back here of my own choice.  Maybe if I sprouted a penis and wore an ironic teeshirt or button down plaid shirt stuffed with muscles I would. But until then, I'll stay away.I've been here a few times to meet colleagues for a drink after work.  It has a nice wood interior and the booths have plenty of room for people to sit comfortably even when it gets packed.  Parking can be difficult if the area is busy, so arrive early if you want to park close.The happy hour menu is pretty good and so is the food.  My two favorite apps to order are:Cheese CurdsPretzelThe Cheese Curds are especially good....you can't find them in very many places and the few that have it aren't as good as this place.  The Pretzel is pretty awesome too.Overall, it's not too bad of a place.Return Factor - 75%

Review Text :
This shop is a converted house in the Coronado neighborhood of downtown phoenix. It has just opened.I ordered the carne asada tacos and they came in a corn tortilla with guacamole and grilled onions and they were really really good, they are street tacos style My wife ordered the quesadilla vegetariana and she really liked it, she liked the jamaica Mexican water even more!They also offer coronitas, which is nice if you just want a small beer.The only thing i didn't like was the ambiance, it was missing some music, and the fact that it won't be open on Sundays. But, with $2.25 tacos you can't go wrong!My boyfriend insisted this place was great so I gave it a try last night. I felt bad at first walking in at 7:45 since they close at 8 but they were more than happy to take my last minute order. The torta is amazing. It was not too greasy, just perfect. My boyfriend had the carne asada burrito which was delicious. All the ingredients tasted very fresh. I had an Horchata which was excellent too. The salsa is definitely the best part. It very unique. I know that people keep saying blah blah renovated homes but I still think they are great. I will be back for sure.Best "street style" carne asada taco I've ever had.  The Vampiro is basically the same think but it comes on a tostada so you have to pick it up and eat it like a vampire, thus the name Vampiro.The salsa is great, I don't know what "style" it is because every now and again I've had it other places but it's my favorite. It's a cross between a pico and a red sauce, blended but not runny at all.Yes they make you pay for chips and salsa, and I've seen the tiny tablespoon size take out container for salsa so beware.Cute restored house.   I'll be back soon, if not everyday from now on.I had no idea this place existed even though I've driven past it a ton of times. It didn't really catch my attention. When my husband suggested we go there, I said "Huh? Where?" Been there once, definitely crave it again.The carne asada burrito was delicious, and it was the perfect serving size. I was able to eat it all but I wasn't left hungry or unsatisfied either. They could definitely use some help in the service/usability department though. When I first walked in, I had no idea where the menu was (it's written in chalk on the walls in very large print...so large I didn't even think to look at it as a menu). Mmmm...I want a burrito now.This is a little gem.  Sometimes it's best to do one thing and do it really well.  America's does carne asada REALLY well!!  The meat is tender and flavorful and delicious!!  I had a carne asada burrito and it was probably the best I've ever had. But let me speak of the guacamole.....mmmmmm!!  If you like guac, this is awesome guac!!  It's got just enough kick in it and it is very tasty.  Their chips are fresh and crispy and a nice compliment to the guac.  My daughter loved the cheese quesedilla and ate the whole thing.  When we got in the car to leave she said she wanted to come back the next day!  That's high praise from a six year old!The shop is a cute little house with several tables inside and a nice seating area outside.  Parking can be a little of a challenge.  There is only one way in and it's the same way out.  So if you're leaving and someone is coming in, well....you get the picture.  The staff is always friendly and accomodating.  They make you feel at home.  The prices are reasonable so you don't break the bank either.  Thank you America!!Besides the little street taco cart that is parked in a lot on 28th st and Mcdowell that I go to for my carne asada tacos...this comes in 2nd place:)  I am really picky about carne asada...many places make them either too dry or not flavorful enough...well not my little street taco cart,,,,and not my America's Taco shop!!!I order two things here..Tacos and Quesadilla....I normally do not eat quesadilla, but here its something else...Cheese, moist and perfectly seasoned asada, with grilled sauteed onions all between a light crisp homemade tortilla?!?  What else can be better??  Well, maybe there are other things:)  But for this moment, during my 15 sec of fame...I mean review....Lets amuse ourselves:)  Go...you will not be disappointedYes, the bean and cheese burrito was good.  Yes, I'm glad they don't use lard (then it's vegetarian).  It was hot and cheesy.  But, it was just beans and cheese.  Nothing fancy.  I won't rave over it.The chips and salsa were OK.  I would have liked more salsa, but since you have to pay extra to get them in the first place, I didn't want to get charged more.The highlight of dinner?  The horchata!  I even got a refill to go as I left.I will probably go back, but I won't be craving it.I drive by this taco shop treat on a daily basis and love shopping in the Melrose District. Mexican food restaurants line the streets of Arizona like every day is Cinco de Drinko, so I had to check them out and see how they earn the title of America's Taco Shop. During the work day, I'm on the hunt for lunch spots where I can be in and out without a true sit-down experience. Someplace with an outdoor patio is a plus, unless it's a sauna outside. America's Taco Shop had just that. You enter and order at the counter, then you can chose indoor or outdoor seating. Sadly, it was a bit windy when I went and in addition to my plastic silverware running away from me, the misters decided I needed a mid-afternoon shower. With such Yelp reviews, I felt the pressure when ordering my food and wanted to make sure I got the real experience, so I asked the cashier what his favorite choice was. He said the Carne Asade Burrito was hands down his favorite. I'm not going to question the man who lives and breathes by the restaurant.  They brought me chips and salsa while I waited. The chips tasted fresh and probably homemade. The salsa had a hint of a kick to it but not enough to send you to the fire hydrant. Then came the burrito. The tortilla was homemade, fresh and like it was straight from Mexico. Very tasty! The burrito itself was pretty darn good. I'm a sucker for guac so I wish I'd asked for some on the side. I've been to my fair share of Mexican restaurants and this burrito pretty much melted in your mouth. So on days when I'm a lunchtime loner or the social butterfly with friends, I'll definitely recommend this spot for tacos....wish I could have tried the margaritas. Cha Ching! The cashier pointed out two great traits. 1. Taco Tuesdays: four tacos for $6.00. Not bad! 2. Happy Hour. The happiest hour of them all with $2 beers and $1 tacos. Looks like I'll also be making a stop on my way home from work!Americas is a place that I had to visit more then once before I reviewed. It is good. The carne asada was tender and had a nice charred flavor. The bean and cheese burrito was good. The chips and salsa were bland, the salsa was "tomato sauce" as one of the 10 year kids said. The price was a little high esp $1.50 for each can of pop. That is $9 a six pack....On the way home from work yesterday, a friend wanted to meet up at America's Taco Shop for a snack & catch up conversation and chisme -- You know me, I'm all about good tacos & chisme! I ordered the Carne Asada Burrito -- delicious & full of flavors. Somethin' about the recipe they use for the carne asada alone makes it special. I look forward to returning -- now that it's cooler, outdoor seating will be ideal. Cheers***

Good Cheap Eats with Downtown Atmosphere!!After reading the other reviews I really don't know what NEW I can add!!This place is NO frills, Cheap & OK fair with OK service-Nothing memorable but the atmosphere and CAST of characters you are sure to run across here.If you don't wanna wait in a long line, pay alot of $$ for little "gourmet" dishes and you like a little pie with your meal-Give it a go.WARNING: Sit at the counter at your own risk. High traffic and it's kinda gross they put all the dirty plates,etc in bus tubs right under the counter in front of you as you eat!!!

Ruby and I have had an on again off again relationship for about 12 years now. It's been close to 3 or 5 years since our last scandalous meeting.I like that Ruby has attempted to change her look with choices such as mashed cauliflower, and spaghetti squash. I even liked that she shows a bit extra with the calorie count on 'some' of her options. Makes choosing that much easier, although she does hide the calories on most of her selections. My thought on that one is that she likely doesn't want to scare you away by showing too much on items like her bacon, cheese, avocado, Angus burger. I can only imagine the distressed thoughts I would have had if I had seen the truth before ordering the meatloaf. Thanks Ruby for making it easy to splurge this time. ;-)Apparently, about a 1/3 of Ruby's gastronomic repertoire now comes with her salad bar at no added cost, and my choice of meatloaf just happened to be one of those as well as the wife's grilled chicken. It turned out to be one of those surreal moments for me. I was excited to get a seemingly free bonus, but at the same time would THIS be the day I break the no buffet style dining promise I made to myself and the wife on that fateful day back in aught nine?Unluckily for me, Ruby had left a little something extra mixed in with her 'mixed greens' that day. Who knows, maybe it was Ruby, maybe it was one of her ladies in waiting, or maybe it was just a random customer with a 10 inch locks. Either way, I was fully unappetized after serving myself some salad with a side of dark brown hair. Maybe I should have jumped ship at this point, but how was I to know it wasn't going to get much better? The food was average at best, and the wait staff didn't seem overly apologetic about the added locks of love incident. In fact, the first waitress I showed this to didn't even take the plate from me, I had to hand it to the bartender behind the bar myself before I could get rid of it.The meat loaf was 'mehh, whatever' and the grilled BBQ chicken wasn't any better. The only saving grace here was the cauliflower and spaghetti squash; but truly, those are dishes that can be made easily with a few minutes of prep work at home. Needless to say, I didn't walk away from this meal with a happy ending. Sorry Ruby, but our on and off again relationship is officially off, but never again. Your services will no longer be traded for my hard earned cash.

Review Text :
I stopped into Cafe Raymond with my parents for breakfast when they visited town last Sat.  My original plan was to take them to DeLuca's, but unsurprisingly, the line was long. Since I hadn't been to Cafe Raymond before, I figured this was as good of a reason as any to stop by, so I suggested it and we headed in.  Although it was fairly busy even here, I was able to snag a table while they ordered, so we were able to tuck in as soon as our orders came up.We ordered the following items: blueberry lemon ricotta pancakes for me ($8.99); blueberry French toast for my mom ($8.99), and cheddar cheese omelette for my dad ($8.99).  Despite seeming thick, the pancakes were surprisingly light and fluffy because of the ricotta, and the lemon added a delicious tang.  Even without the syrup, they were very tasty, but the syrup added some nice moisture.  My mom let me try a bite of the French toast, and the bread was light, but had a nice crunch.  The star of the show was the compote, however, which was just sweet enough--not overly so--and showcased the ripe fruit.  I didn't try my dad's omelette, but he said it was also quite fluffy, and was filled with a decent amount of cheese.  As can be seen from the photos, the presentation was also quite nice, a welcome change from the norm at many diners.The staff were also quite friendly, and were prompt about wiping off our table after my mom spilled some coffee on it.  While the prices are a bit steep, I think they're warranted, given the sophistication of the food and that credit cards are accepted.  Overall, I'd say that Cafe Raymond has one of the best breakfasts in the Strip (hence my rating), so don't hesitate to stop by and try it if the lines at the competition are too long, or if you're looking for something different than the usual.  I look forward to dropping in again soon to try one of the lunch items such as the tomato mozzarella sandwich.This place wasn't as busy as I thought it would be, especially for Sunday brunch. There were still enough customers to keep most of the tables occupied though. I didn't like the concept of having to order at the counter because I didn't like having to make my decision of what to order under pressure, as there was a line forming behind us. I ended up hastily choosing the French toast. Boyfriend got the BLT. You can help yourself to tap water, which I tried to do, but the pitcher was empty and had to be brought to the counter for them to refill. (I know they are busy, but honestly water is pretty important and they need to find a better way to dispense water if they can't be attentive to the pitcher.) The table we sat at had crumbs on it from the previous diners and the knife and fork given to me for my French toast looked dirty. Luckily, my French toast with berry compote was good. I also loved the way the home fries that came with the BLT were seasoned. This place does have good brunch food, so if you don't feel like waiting in the long line at Pamela's around the corner, try Cafe Raymond, but don't have high expectations for service or cleanliness.

Review Text :
I feel like I need to write an update since somehow I am the only reviewer and I last reviewed in November 2008.  This is hands down the best sushi place in Vegas.  I grew up eating Gulf Coast sushi in Houston and always thought that was the freshest, the best...but seriously, Chef Jin gets fresh fish daily, and gets his hands on anything exotic.Last night he treated me to madai, Japanese snapper, a fresh fish he sliced off the filet during dinner.  He is always creating new things.  I just go and never order - he makes whatever (knows what I like and what I don't), and he and his wife (the outstanding waitress and hostess Yura) are so kind.  I get matcha iced tea without asking.  I have a favorite seat.  They put on sports on the flatscreen when I come in.Honestly, I worried when he added all-you-can-eat because the quality is too good.  You can get any roll, any appetizer (including hamachi kama), any salad, any nigiri, handrolls, ikura, uni, sweet shrimp, tempura, mochi, you name it - for $25.95.  I only do all you can eat on a rare occasion because I usually just eat nigiri and maybe a handroll or interesting creation.  Rolls are too filling for me.In summary, the food is great, the service outstanding, the atmosphere quaint and casual, the prices reasonable, the green iced tea yummy, hot sake ready, and for the special occasion, I get the chocolate souffle for dessert.  I couldn't live without this neighborhood joint!  Just see my zillion pics for food inspiration.Another review goes out to Lisa L.! We are always on the lookout for great AYCE sushi - and we're bigger fans of the fish itself and not the rolls.  Blue Fin Sushi definitely impressed up with the quality of their fish.First off, Blue Fin is a small restaurant - more like a mom and pop's place.  It's almost better to keep this place on the down low because I would hate to have to wait for a seat here.Our party of three plus toddler went for the AYCE dinner option at $25.95/pp.  First off - uni, limit one order per person and dinner only.  Because of the weather in California, they did not get their shipment.  Oh.  Would they be willing to give us an extra order of amaebi then?  Yes.  Sweet!  And when it arrived, it looked just fabulous and tasted good too!We went to work ordering a bunch of nigiri and was pleasantly surprised with how they came out.  More often than not, AYCE sushi places just shove as many pieces on a plate as they can.  But they actually presented it quite nicely for us, which we appreciated.  We were especially impressed with their super white tuna, which I am certain was escolar.  (Super white tuna usually means albacore, so escolar is definitely a highlight!)  Their version of ikura was a bit different - it actually seemed like they made it themselves since the eggs didn't separate and were still within the sac, if that makes any sense.Another highlight was their spicy rolls - I'm not a fan of the Sriracha-based kind and this was mayo-based.  Yum!We also really enjoyed their Soft Shell Crab Tempura (limit one order per person, dinner only).  It had a nice batter and was definitely tasty!The Husband ordered the Grilled Yellowtail Collar (limit one order per person, dinner only), but hoped they had forgotten since he was getting full.  When it did arrive, it was a huge piece!  It looked like the equivalent of two collars usually served at other restaurants!Another highlight - unlimited dessert! Green tea and red bean ice cream, mochi ice cream, and tempura ice cream are available.  The tempura ice cream is a huge scoop and we were surprised with how generous it was.Service did take a bit long, and we were there for a good while, more than the hour time limit.  But there was only the only waitress and the restaurant definitely was filled to the max while we were there.  In this case, we didn't mind - but if it was just the two of us, we might have gotten a bit anxious.Overall, Blue Fin Sushi is a place I would recommend for good quality sushi.  I can't comment on their fancy rolls, but we liked what we ate and would definitely go back!There are outdoor tables, but I'm not sure it they open them up when the weather gets better or not.Lunch (11:00 am to 3:00 pm) $21.95/ppDinner (3:00 pm to 11:00 pm) $25.95/pp60 minute limitUpdate! (05.12.10)Went back for a return visit and we were both pleased with our experience there.Only a handful of customers sitting at the sushi bar, and that's where we chose to sit as well.  Ordered a bunch of nigiri and they had uni this time as well.  The soft shell crab was served up on a nice bed of salad greens with a sauce on it this time, which wasn't a problem since we asked for no sauce the next time.  Overall, we took our time and was out within an hour.  They didn't disappoint on quality at all.With so many AYCE sushi places in Vegas, the wife introduced me to Blue Fin Sushi, and I think our sushi cravings have found a new home in Vegas.   The fish was of better quality in comparison with other AYCE places.  The pieces fish were chilled (not warm, like in some places we went to) and exquisitely sliced in large portions (some places do a hack job!).  I think the wife and I are purists because we tend to focus on nigiri, instead of the rolls.  This is the main reason why I will come back...the sushi rice.  The sushi rice is amazing here. It has been seasoned so well.  The texture of the short grain rice flavored with the slight hint of sushi vinegar is absolutely perfect for me.  For example, when I take a bite of the super white tuna nigiri, I first taste that slight hum of rice vinegar from the rice on my tongue.  My tastebuds then witness the sweetness and slight creamy flavor of the fish as it slowly intermingles and compliments the vinegar flavor from the rice as I chew.  The wife and I also request that certain sauces should not be poured on the nigiri, such as amaebi.  I just want to taste the rice and the fish, and chew slowly so i enjoy every bit of it. yummm.  The other stand out item to order here is the soft-shell crab appetizer.  This is probably one of the best places that this is prepared.  They use a panko coating/batter and deep fry the think.  It's like eating pork tonkatsu, except instead with a crunchy and crispy crust covering a moist and  tender soft-shell crab.  Definitely, we will be frequenting this place more often.  Plus, I still need to go back to try some Okinawan beer.Finally was able to go and give the much recommended Blue Fin Sushi on the SE side of Las Vegas a try.  I was there because of an UYE Lunch event hosted by Jessica R, plus also in attendance was Lisa L who organized the last UYE dinner event there. And it was totally worth skipping the free meal at Aria's employee dining and shelling out the $25.95 (dinner AYCE price, because I wanted to order the uni, amaebi and hamachi kama that is only available during dinner AYCE).  Not only was the food we ordered as good as I imagined it to be, Chef Jin (the chef/proprietor of Blue Fin) also made some special (off menu?) treats for us. The "Shiso Special" would make an excellent amuse-bouche at much fancier restaurants up and down the Strip. It is diced sashimi (tuna, salmon, and yellowtail) flavored with fresh herbs, sesame seeds, Chef's secret sauce, covered with fried shiso leaf, garnished with masago (red, and green), ikura (salmon roe), and truffle oil. To start off the meal, we ordered a lot of nigiri (yellowtails, salmon, uni, amaebi, halibut, red snapper, bunch of spicy tuna and hamachi hand rolls), and Chef Jin hooked us all up with Yellowtail Belly (not part of the regular AYCE menu).  All the sushi were fresh and delicious. Our waitress did her best to try and take orders from all five of us, and some of the items we tried to order was left out, but it was no biggie. The food we were served were great and we ordered more in our second round.Recommendation:  If you go for AYCE, even during lunch (11am-3pm), and you enjoy uni (sea urchin), amaebi (sweet shrimp) or hamachi kama (yellowtail collar), it is worth it to pay the few extra dollars for the dinner AYCE price and be able to order those item.The restaurant is relatively small, so if you plan to go with a group it is best to call ahead and make a reservation.The iced green tea looks great and is probably healthier than plain iced water.Come hungry for AYCE :)Rating breakdown:Service - goodFood - excellentAmbiance - nice, plays cool musics (some 80s) but not of Japanese artists.Interior - clean, limited seating.Price - about what most other AYCE Sushi restaurants charges.Location - great for those living in the SE Las Vegas or near UNLV, but worth the drive if you live in other parts of Las Vegas.  -  Out of Town Visitors - It is worth it to rent a car if you plan to venture off Strip to this sushi restaurant. Your cab fare back and forth would probably be more than 1 day's rental rate.I feel this restaurant really earned a 4.5 Yelp Stars in my book.  And next time I will see if Chef Jin needs anyone to stage at his restaurant, because I would enjoy learning from him.Blue Fin is my favorite AYCE in Vegas.  There are other good spots in town to get your sushi fix, but Blue Fin is the only place that I'll do AYCE alone.  That may sound anti social, but really, the sushi here is good enough that I'll dine all by myself and not have to worry about sharing.  Not that you have to worry about sharing, it is AYCE after all...but most of the time, doing AYCE is a group affair.The fish here has been consistently fresh during my visits.  There are always different specials on the chalkboard to try out.  The rolls here are creative enough that I don't mind ordering one or two (I've very much become a nigiri and hand roll kind of guy).  You can also do half orders of rolls to make sure you get as much variety as possible during your meal.So perhaps the last paragraph can apply to numerous spots in town...but the one thing that I think does it for me at Blue Fin is the sushi rice.  It is delicious, and I do not mind ordering nigiri in lieu of sashimi.  I like the rice that much.  It may be a little thing, but it makes my tastebuds happy.Blue Fin's another one of those special places, the kind where you have to stop by if you're in the neighborhood.  I'm looking at you, Sunrise Coffee!  It's a perfect two-hit combo of an evening.I love Blue Fin. Just come here. End of review.No really. Just come here. They have AYCE sushi. AYCE sushi is top secret code for we love feeding you sushi until you burst. They have some amazing sushi. Speciality sushi rolls are all the bomb. Ultimate blue fin, volcano, and *** are just some. Some of the rolls are loaded with sauce so just ask them for sauce on the side or ask for half roll as is.I even did the hand rolls which comes in a stand that can hold 3 hand rolls and sometimes they're so big that the stand can't hold it so no stand is used. Try the salmon skin hand roll its good.For nigiri all excellent choices. I had lots of nigiri uni with quails egg, tako octopus,... Get the garlic ahi nigiri drool.The poke salad was ok. It was stretched out with lots of non-ahi ingredients like some of the other sushi spots here.They didn't have oysters on the AYCE menu and I didn't order shrimp tempura but everything else was amazing enough to make me not care about it. For desserts they have red bean ice cream, not small scoops but regular size ice cream scoops. Mochi and fried tempura ice cream. All that are also AYCE.So good that I almost did AYCE lunch the day after I did AYCE dinner. When's the next time. I'm actually craving sushi today. Next time has to be tonight LOLPremature yelp review post. Noticed I wasn't finish.I've had this place bookmarked for ages, so hopefully I didn't just have expectations that were too high.We came here today because my fella was craving some sushi. I insisted we skip our favorite AYCE sushi, Goyemon to try this place across town. From the first bite, my fella was disappointed. After every bite I got that look from him like, "see, we should have gone to Goyemon," I enjoy sushi rice, but this was just so overwhelmingly vinegary. It's the only flavor we could taste. I like to taste the flavor of the fish, but all I got was overwhelming flavor of vinegar in every single bite. I was very disappointed. I ordered a little of everything. Plenty of nigiri, salmon skin handroll, green mussels, agedashi tofu, seaweed salad, tempura calamari and a few other items that I can't remember. The seaweed salad was really sour and not my favorite version I've ever had. The salmon skin handroll was pretty good. I like the salmon quite a bit, that's usually one of my favorite things to order at every sushi place. The only thing that was annoying was how flimsy the handrollls were put together. They fell apart so quickly and made a total mess. The calamari, tofu and mussels were all pretty tasty, although I prefer my mussels in the shell. I would order all three of those again. All the nigiri was fresh and really good, but I had to dab each one to remove excess vinegar from atop it, to make it more palatable. The desserts were pretty good. My fella felt vindicated a little when he ate the tempura ice cream with green tea ice cream and then quickly ordered another to finish up the meal.Service was pleasant and efficient. I hope this was a one off for this resataurant, since I see so many great reviews from Yelpers I respect.I never did think that I'd be able to replace my favorite sushi restaurant (Sin City Sushi), but, it has happened. Well, sorta. I cannot completely write off Sin City, because once you have Young's garlic sauce, or his mussels, you will seriously crave them for days after... but, Blue Fin executes all their dishes delightfully well.Jin, the owner (I believe) is from Hawaii. The first night I went with my boyfriend, it was a quiet Sunday night. We were served by a young woman who was also from Hawaii. Service was fast, friendly, and extremely patient!  Blue Fin has an exceptional selection of rolls, appetizers and nigiri.My boyfriend and I usually get a lot of nigiri, and that night was no different. We had garlic tuna, hamachi, ika (with salt and lemon), amaebi, cajun albacore, tako, and a bunch more.Great fish to rice ratio, and the few rolls that we did try were a good size (*PLUS, they do half rolls!*) They have awesome appetizers. I love mussels, but the mussels here are a little different from everywhere else. So just be aware that when ordering mussels here, they are already off the shell, and come in a special dish. We also had their tuna crab cake, salmon skin salad, and "poki" ( i always spelled it poke.. hmm)All came with shredded beet and carrot toppings. I don't like beets AT ALL, regardless of what Dr. Oz says about the nutritional value they possess, it detracted from what would have been all together delicious, again, my own personal opinion.Anyway, the restaurant setting and my overall experience here leads me to conclude that this restaurant is a solid 4 stars. Their quality of fish is on the higher end as compared with some other popular names in the AYCE sushi world.Will go back if I'm in the area.Yelp, you have failed me!  I had such great hopes before visiting -- from all of the 4 and 5 star reviews and from the consistent Sushi threads in the talk forum.I think what happens is that the trend reviews really skews reviewer's perception.  Either that or I just went on an off day.In regards to overall atmosphere, appearance, quality of food, and variety, Blue Fin doesn't come anywhere close to Goyemon.   This is coming from someone who believes that Goyemon has been on the decline of late.I left Blue Fin full, feeling sick, and wanting my money back.  What the hell is in the sauce on your eel and rolls.  Do they put cornstarch in there to thicken it?  The Udon soup tasted foul as well.  The fry they use in their soft shell crab and agadashi tofu was definitely not japanese.  The only saving grace of this place was their salmon skin salad which was delicious.  Still, there is no reason for me to come back.   There's probably 100 sushi AYCE places in Vegas and I would rate Blue Fin as average.This week was my first time and wasn't disappointed. I've had Blue Fin Sushi & Roll bookmarked ever since I've read all their positive reviews.  Last week I had overall poor experience at a sushi restaurant in San Diego. I don't want to embarrass I-Sushi so I won't mention their name.  I knew redemption was needed and needed quick.My visit was during lunch time and chose their AYCE for $21.99. I want to add that from the outside, this joint looks bigger than it really is.  The ambiance was perfect around 11:40 AM for someone eating alone and we all know for the best service, you have eat at the bar near the sushi artists. There was only one other patron here at the time. That only lasted about 20 minutes because once noon hit, the fans started showing up. Every seat was taken and a line was forming by 12:30 PM. Just keeping up with the Jones'. Just another sign that Blue Fin is the way to go.I had a couple of items for my AYCE venture;-Nigiri: Yellowtail, Salmon, and the Garlic Spicy Tuna-Rolls:  Tried their Rock and Roll, which is a cucumber wrapped roll with crab, tuna, salmon, and yellowtail-Hand Rolls: Spicy Crab and the Crunch ShrimpEverything I've tried was delicious and fresh. I thought that the Nigiri's were small, but it's all you can eat. Order more if it's not enough.  I did just that, I ordered and ordered until I was able to erase my last poor experience in San Diego.  To be honest, the food was so satisfying here that just my first nigiri already made up for it.This review cannot end without commenting on the service. 5 stars for service alone. Even though I was just one of about forty that was eating here, they made me feel like a rockstar (no, not the energy drink).  Watch these guys in action. Rolls, bowls, and shashimi's ordered and delivered with the quickness. All it takes is some eye contact and they're ready to take your request.My only gripe about this place...it's on the opposite side of town from where I am normally at. Guess that's not their fault. On a side note...thanks to all the fellow Yelpers that either gave suggestions for next time or wished me a good lunch due to my experience over the weekend. You guys rock!!The more AYCE sushi I have in Vegas, the more I appreciate a la carte places: they typically have the quality I want, without the obligation to overeat to "get my money's worth". I'd be in trouble if I lived closer to Blue Fin, because it's a good combination of the best of both worlds!Came in on a random weekday evening, sampled a bunch of their apps (the poke was a bit spicy, the screaming o was mostly sauce, and the tempura soft shell crab was a flavorless half crab), lots of nigiri (the garlic tuna and spicy garlic tuna were both standouts!) and a few of their rolls (the featured special roll, CM4? was the best). Fish was fresh, rolls were tight, rice was correctly portioned, and even better than all of the above was the service. Like I said, I tend to overdo it at AYCE joints, but the servers here were super-fast and nonjudgmental- every time more food was brought out, they'd ask without batting an eye what we'd like next.

Restaurant name  Hokkaido Teppanyaki Steak House
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
I've never been a fan of the whole teppanyaki experience.  Growing up in San Francisco, I used to watch the tourists enjoy the theatrics at the famous Benihana restaurant in Japantown.It all looked like fried rice to me and I always wondered how the food got properly divided when you have multiple parties at your table.After watching a teppanyaki competition on the Food Network, I realized there was a bit more to just cooking on a propane-heated flat surface grill.First off, it helped that the Husband and I had the teppanyaki chef all to ourselves.  Sure, it's not likely you'll get that experience, but it definitely contributes to a good or bad evening.  Chefs with a good personality will give a good show and everyone will have a good time.I chose the Chicken and Scallop Combination Dinner ($24.95), while the Husband chose the New York Steak and Chicken Combination Dinner ($26.95).  They both came with miso soup, ginger salad, steam rice, shrimp and seasoned vegetables.  The waitress was a smart one - she offered edamame to start when she got our beverage orders.  And suggested the fried rice option when we put our food orders in.  We declined and she offered one order so we could share it.  For $2.95 more, we upgraded one of our steamed rices to a fried rice.When it came down to it, our chef was entertaining and engaging.  He did a few tricks that we didn't see during the competition, and that had us a bit surprised.  He was friendly and personable, and it did make for an enjoyable eating experience.Food-wise, we were both pretty full surprisingly.  Was it worth the $50?  Not really.  (It helped that we had a BOGO free entree with the Entertainment card.)  It was definitely something to experience at least once.Not only do they have teppanyaki tables, but regular tables and a small sushi bar.  Most diners were enjoying the teppanyaki experience here though.Reservations recommended, especially on Mother's Day! Four of us enjoyed good service, typical show with juggling knives by teppanyaki chef making corny jokes, good tasting lobster/filet mignon/NY steak/chicken/shrimp/veggies/fried rice/miso soup/Japanese salad and side of Rainbow Roll. All food was cooked to order/perfection, nice restaurant decor, friendly staff especially the hostess who doubled as a waitress.Over priced for a little bit of food, as typical for this type of meal; but it was a special occasion this Mother's Day so we tried this place and have no regrets!

Having gone to the 16th Street location a few times figured it was time to hit Mesa and try the one closest to us. Okay, so you drive through the ghetto, then you hit a nice part by the art center and then ghetto again.. this is definitely a great way to see the cultural diversity of Mesa. Be on the lookout for an old Long John Silvers building and you've found Tortas El Güero.. Me and the Mr chowed fiercely! Torta Alambre.. steak and bacon sizzled with peppers, onions and cheese all on a toasted roll.. outfuckingstanding! Dowse this big'un in the avocado salsa and  your tummy will be warm and toasty for hours! The quesadilla version, just as awesome! Pastor was amazingly tender and almost as huge as the Alambre! This one dip into the chipotle cream for some spicy creamy goodness! Tortas are 4.99-6.60 and they are HUGE, one will do you.. me and the Mr just over order and over eat when we go out.. that's probably why were so fat, and so happy!

Restaurant name  Spicy Tuna Sushi

Review Text :
This is a pretty solid non-AYCE joint in Henderson/Anthem area. My husband and I were in the area and I have had this place bookmarked forever, plus it was recently recommended by Matt S, so deciding where to have early dinner was no brainer.We started with a couple of (underwhelming) appetizers: Calamari Tempura and Bacon Maki. I was not impressed with either selection and let my husband finish both. The calamari was 90% scrape-the-roof-of-your-mouth-raw tempura with a small chewy bit of octopus. Bacon Maki was scallop wrapped in bacon - I mean I am a fan of anything wrapped in bacon, but this combo didn't work for me. The bacon tasted rubbery, old and microwaved. We ordered salmon nigiri and scallop nigiri and both were fantastic. The cuts of fish were quite large on a tiny bed of rice, and most importantly, they were fresh.We ordered 3 rolls of sushi as I typically like to balance out my rolls. I generally opt for a havier baked roll, a spicy roll, and a very simple and fresh roll. We went with:Sun Devil RollSmoked salmon, cream cheese, avocado, ebi, spicy crab, sliced jalapeno, served w/ yum yum  (4/5)Rainbow RollFresh tuna, salmon, yellowtail, shrimp, halibut on top of california roll (5/5)Kiss of Fire W/ Extra Spicy SauceShrimp tempura, spicy soft shell crab, spicy tuna, crab, cucumber, albacore (4/5)We topped it off with two orders of mochi.The total pre tip was ~$70 and based on the portion and quality of the fish, it was well worth the money. The interior is spacious and clean, and appears to have the neighborhood appeal judging by some of the regulars that were there. The service was friendly and accomodating.I would both recommend this place to others and come back myself.Let me get mathematical on you for a minute.If salmon + crab = awesome, and tomato + avocado = delicious, then adding shredded radish and applying ponzu sauce via the distributive property equals the phenomenal JUSTIN SPECIAL! Shout out to the supporting ingredients: furikake, sesame seeds, and scallions. Okay that last part was theater, not math, but whatever. TLDR: Get the Justin Special, you won't regret it.I really wanted to like Spicy Tuna Sushi but it just wasn't for me. They were recommended so we stopped here for lunch.  It's between Trader Joe's and Kmart off of Eastern.  The dining room is very large with plenty of bar seating.  I was disappointed that they didn't offer any lunch specials with so many other places that do.  Oh well... I wasn't going to leave.  We tried a few different plates.  The Japanese Lasagna roll was good.  Crab and cream cheese baked with cheese on top.  That was right up my alley.  The Gonzo 2 roll was presented beautifully.  This roll had shrimp tempura, spicy tuna, spicy crab, cucumber, seared albacore and crispy onion.  With all of those wonderful ingredients it fell short.  Yeah... I was surprised too! Plus it's just too hard to eat.  Most of the inside fell out just trying to pick up one piece.  Oh well.  It was worth a shot.

Restaurant name  Red Oak Cafe

Review Text :
Firstly, I overheard the cashier making very rude comments about a mentally challenged customer who had just left.  Even if these were   this employee's personal feelings I think it's in poor taste to express those kinds of thoughts in a tone that is audible enough for your other dining customers to here.I had to settle for Red Oak because the seating in both Starbucks and Caribou Coffee was all occupied.I ordered the banana and Nutella pancakes that were on special for $5.50.  Just the pancakes no sides were included.  I was hoping more then anything fruit was served with the pancakes..since the place appears to promote healthy food.  When dining in Toronto two slices of fruit usually comes standard but the same is not true around these parts.  Just a slice of honey dew would have been a cheerful addition to the pancakes but no such luck for me. The pancakes were cooked perfectly.  I also got a blueberry mango smoothie that was really delicious and tasted very much of real mango and not of mango flavored syrup. What I did not agree with was the silverware system.  I assumed which I shouldn't have that I would be given silverware. However you have to get your own silverware.  I told the cashier when I placed my order this was my first time dining there it would have been nice had she pointed me in the direction of the silverware after learning that information.There is a reason why this place was practically empty when the surrounding restaurant were packed.  The food is expensive. I saw on the chalk board menus that salads go for as much as $9.00 dollars there. I'd go back for another smootie but nothing more then that.

Review Text :
I was lucky enough to be invited to an evening at Imagine Spain last week, before their Grand Opening.  (They are now officially open).  So, I cannot speak to the pricing although I have a feeling it's reasonable.  I can, however, tell you that the paella at Imagine Spain was just as amazing as the paella I remember eating in Valencia years ago!  This may be due to the fact that one of the owners is from there and brought the recipe with her!  I can also tell you that the sangria (I had the red) was so delicious - I couldn't get enough of it.  Good thing Jared was driving that night!The decor is simple but cute... and the people were extremely welcoming... except for when Jared went into the women's bathroom because someone was in the men's and he really had to go - i don't think they were too happy about that!Overall, if you like authentic Spanish food and a laid back, simple atmosphere, take a trip to Imagine Spain - it's the next best thing to the real thing... and much less time consuming and cheaper too!  Buen provecho!

Restaurant name  Little Sheep Mongolian Hot Pot
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
As far as hotpot goes, I think that this is the only decent one in Montreal so far.  Located up on the second floor with ample views of the mean streets of Chinatown, a window seat is almost mandatory for the full experience. The three most important things for a delicious hotpot are:-robust broth (so I recommend only ordering their spicy herbal broth)-fresh vegetables and thin sliced meats-a well-made dipping sauceThe well-made sauce portion of a good hotpot meal relies solely on you, the patron, to make at the sauce bar.  No one is going to hold your hand through this process, but I can attempt to give you a quick recipe for a good one;  2:12 hot chili oil with bits, 2:12 soy sauce, 1:12 sesame oil, 2:12 scallion/chives, 2:12 cilantro (a must have), 1:12 vinegar, 1:12 paste/minced garlic, 1:12 ginger paste.  There is also a sesame paste sauce that can be made using diluted sesame paste, but I like spicy.Don't be afraid of the watercress, and try making a hard boiled egg.  The cooked egg is delicious peeled and then dipped into your dipping sauce.There is also a small buffet portion set up that has things like spring rolls and sesame balls.  But, I found these items not to be very fresh.  There is also an all-you-can-drink soda and juice fountain that actually has some delicious sweetened soy milk on tap and orange juice.

Review Text :
Yum Yum!! This place holds a special spot in my oft drunken heart.After a long night out (as most nights are in Scotland...if you're doing things right that is), I would routinely found myself in need of a falafel/Donner (as one does), but had no idea where to start my quest for greasy nirvana. Now if you don't know, not all chip shops are created equally; they all lure you in with the heavenly aroma only triple fried meat and potato can make, but few live up to the hype. You could  try one of the small ones on Rose Street, or stand in line with tourists  on the Mile, but you'll end up with basically the same level of food; it will absolutely get the job done (trust me!) but won't leave you super happy. If you're looking for something that is better than average, Yum Yum is the answer. I personally like the one on George 4th Bridge, but the other one (which I've only been to in a fog, couldn't tell you the address) was also quite good. The guys running the place got to know us over the week we were there (good thing?...not sure lol), and were very friendly every time we showed up. Walking in, you won't find a lot of space to sit, which was A-OK with us, as we were on our way home every time we stopped by*. The place next door (painted red, can't remember the name), is huge and also smells heavenly...but the guys are rude, the food is meh, and the extra seating allows youths to sit/loiter for extended periods of time (thanks, but no thanks).  Speaking of food, Yum Yum is spot on. I recommend the Donner and chips, but the pizza is good, as are the pies and fish. Seriously, you can't get hurt at Yum Yum**If you find yourself out past last call in this amazing city, and need some Donner to soak up some of the party you just drank down, look to Yum Yum for the hook up. _______________________________________________*Just a side note; chip shops like this should only be visited in the wee hours of the morning, if this is your main stop for lunch you're doing Edinburgh wrong. **This is a lie, if you eat here too often you will most definitely die of a heart attack...but hey we only live once right?

Jared and I went on a date to Il Terrazzo for dinner on Friday night.  We had a gift card valid for dinner for two, and we were waiting for the perfect night to use it.  Friday night was just cool enough to sit outside and enjoy the patio at Il Terrazzo, and we did just that...Service was spot on, ambiance was great, and food did not disappoint either.  I forgot how much I am a fan of the Phoenician's homemade bread until our basket came... pair that with the dirty martini I ordered and I was one happy camper!  But of course we didn't stop there.  I had a Caesar Salad and J went with the Caprese Salad to start.  He ordered Veal Ravioli for the next course and of course I had to try it... it was creamy and heavy but in a good way.  We definitely could've stopped there but too late - our entrees were on their way!  J went with the Kobe Flat Iron and I had the Scallops.  Way way way too much food, but we did take home leftovers.  We passed on dessert but still left with full bellies.Il Terrazzo is on the pricey side.  As a matter of fact, our gift card covered everything but my drink, and my one martini was $19.77 before tip!  Pretty insane, right?  I'm not sure we'd rush back on our own dime, but we'll be there in a heartbeat if someone else foots the bill!For August breakfast club we headed on over for Sunday Brunch at IL Terrazzo, and let me tell you, this brunch is decadent! It was an Italian Market Brunch, just a beautiful spread of lovely dishes.I have been searching all over the valley for the perfect eggs benedicts and I found them here at IL Terrazzo, the 64° farm egg benedict is creamy, perfectly cooked and just perfect! It's the way an egg should always be done. This was perfection!There is a lot of items to choose from, I'm sure every picky eater could walk away happy.I also tried the Arizona tomatoes, tuna tartar, delish shrimp, shaved prosciutto, handmade mozzarella, other cheeses and meats with breads and a few other items. The brunch spread is extremely nice, and perfectly portioned, most everything is in small single servings. Oh and the desserts, oh my they too were heavenly!This was a great Sunday Brunch and I do look forward to coming back!

Restaurant name  La Mestiza

Review Text :
People get fussy about Mexican restaurants. Is it authentic (which region?)? Is it Americanized? Is it just like the Mexico they saw when they went on vacation? Are they from SoCal or Texas?  There's a place for platters of rice/beans and cheese covering 'something' underneath served with chips from a bag and red or green sauce. Then there are places that seem more real. La Mestiza is one. It's a notch or two up in feel and decor from Tac.Guadalajara and a bit fancier and pricier that La Guanjuatence. The menu is more limited and they seem to want to focus on doing a few things really well. They succeed. They have Negra Modelo on tap, always a good sign. Real Margaritas (talking to you La Guanjuatence!) are a win. The chips were freshly cooked, hot and delish!  Spousal Unit had the Chicken Mole enchiladas. I love mole. Theirs was good and she loved it. A little too sweet for my tastes and it could have been spicier (I say that a lot in Madison). I had the Yucatan classic, Cochinita Pibil. Nicely presented and flavorful. Unlike some of my favorite Mexican places, this is a place you could go on a date.It's not Taqueria Guadalajara, I'll tell ya that much. But it's better than a Doritos Locos at 2am and that says a lot coming from a guy who's a 2am Doritos Locos connosuier.Hands-down my favorite place to get tacos in Madison. And, I'd swear I've already reviewed this place, but apparently I haven't... Hmm. Suffice it to say that I've swung through here at least 7-8 times since discovering it a few months ago.+ Happy hour. $2 Tecate, $5 for 3 street tacos. Runs until 6pm. Outstanding.+ Delicious house-made tortilla chips+ Tasty salsas+ The street tacos. OMG. Finally!!! Someone who knows how to season and sear asada. Everything about these tacos is perfect - fresh, steamed corn tortillas, mounds of delicious steak, mild white onion and fresh cilantro. Yes, yes, yes. + Service is always friendly and prompt+ Nice selection of traditional Mexican brews, all at fair pricesThis is my favorite Mexican restaurant in town. So many reasons - and every time the hubby wants to go to the Other Decent Mexican place, I have to run through my list!1. The best chips in Madison- are freshly fried and served with 2 homemade salsas, spicy chipoltle and avocado/salsa verde. These are brought out right away. (we have never waited longer than 1 minute.)2. The margaritas are made with real lime juice and are delicious!3. They have Negro Modelo on tap, most nights.4. The chef KNOWS what he is doing in the kitchen. He cares and this is shown with the way he plates his food and the general freshness and attention to flavors. The guacamole is fantastic. The cochinita pibil is Amazing. The steak ranchero is perfectly cooked. And the lamb chops!!! The fish tacos are very good. All the other tacos are great too.After 3 years of eating here, we finally met Chef Antonio because we go crazy about the lamb chops special. This is only available sometimes on Wednesdays and only if you ask for it. :) (OK, now I have let the cat out of the bag)But You can have chicken enchiladas if you want.

Review Text :
This is a really decent chippie, and a great local to have. The fish is all fried fresh, and the portions are really generous.Fish and chips shops need to be rated and enjoyed in their own sphere of "good vs bad". Bad are those places where they mass produce and serve on main high streets, where the food sits under heat lamps, dries out and most of the customers are too drunk to realise that it's like eating cardboard. Don't forget the soggy chips.Really amazing fish and chip shops are those that are situated on the coast, you can take your grandma too for lunch and whilst it's still deep fried, it's fresh and light and crisp and wonderful.The Codfather, on top of having a wonderfully punny name, is on the 'good chippie' side of things, yet still a late-night joint where you wouldn't take your grandma for lunch, but you would go if you were still sober or wanted a mid-week cheeky fish supper. The batter is still pretty thick, but it's fresh and crispy, and the fish is SO fresh and the portions are large and delicious.Highly recommended, and I only wish I was no longer GF...

The owners transplanted from the States and set up this Montreal landmark that's been around since the 1970's!Solid BBQ.. served in a barn! Well, it looks and feels like a barn -- if a barn were two stories smack dab in the middle of a major metropolis. Very homey and down to earth, absolutely nothing fancy or hip-and-happening.If you're tired of all the fancy French food and French women and French beer (yeah, craziness I'm sure), you can come here for a slab of Americana. Their portions will blow you away. They only serve two things: roast chicken or ribs. Men: order "The Whole Hog" and prepare to be humbled. So good, but you'll never finish it all.P.S. Whatever you do, don't let your friends convince you to check out Baton Rouge. It's a Lousiana-style chain and it's pretty bad, especially their bland ribs. Bar-B-Barn or bust!

Review Text :
Restaurant Chez Parra is a great little French restaurant in Longueuil, Quebec, which is a suburb of Montreal on the South Shore, just across the waters form that thriving international city.It is long and narrow, with a Salon Prive (private room) in the rear, which our party of 6 occupied, amidst original art decorating the walls. The ambiance is simple, understated, casual elegance and cozy. The menu has traditional French specialities, such as Foie Gras for appetizer, and mains like Duck l'Orange, Veal, and even Rabbit. There are a few other mediterranean infuences like Canelloni and Carpaccio from Italy and  Paella from Spain, and they have several seafood selections like more than one salmon and a trout dish, as well as other popular meat favorites.They have a very affordable 3 course daily  evening special, with appetizer, main and dessert for under $24 CAD (under $20 USD at today's exchange) and most of the entrees a la carte are $18 - $24 CAD,with appetizers in the $6 - $10 CAD range.  They have an adequate wine selection appropriate for their food offerings. Service is very attentive, with the owner/manager  providing personalized suggestions and service. This is mostly a hidden, affordable gem for locals, but if you are ever in Longueuil or along the south shore of Montreal, this would be an excellent, affordable choice for good local French food.

Review Text :
If you love a place so much that you eat it for lunch two days in a row, and upon finishing your second lunch you question whether you should go there for dinner, or just wait for lunch tomorrow, the place deserves five stars.As others have mentioned, they are a little pricier than other Thai places around the valley, but the lunch tofu dishes are $7.95 and come with an egg roll and vegan hot & sour soup, and it is well worth it.I'm one of those fat kids in a skinny-ish body, because I will eat every last bite on the plate in front of me. Generally the portions at Thai places are so huge I feel like a whale after I leave, but Thai Elephant does a good job with their potion sizes (at least for lunch) leaving me satisfied but not feeling glutenous. I need someone to provide me some damn control, because I have none :-pQuick, friendly service. Clean, comfy interior. No complaints. Try the Siamese Basil or Drunken Noodles with Tofu. Both are amazing. Unless you want to crap fire, I suggest getting nothing spicier than medium. Enjoy the visual!!I've dined at Thai Elephant a few times, but more often than that, I've ordered food to go, and I have not been disappointed.  If you're considering Thai food, you cannot go wrong with this place.  As a matter of fact, I'd recommend going out of your way for food from Thai Elephant vs any other Thai in the Valley, even if it may be closer to home.I highly recommend the Green Curry and the fresh rolls, although I haven't had anything from Thai Elephant that I didn't like.  I'm definitely a fan of this place and I'm craving it now just thinking about it!

Restaurant name  John Cutter

Review Text :
John Cutter is a fun little restaurant! It is totally A-Ok in my book.  Here's why I think it is ok:1. Decent size menu with a lot of interesting options.  Lots of your traditional stuff with little twists to make them a bit different from the rest.  We went during breakfast, so I will focus on that for now.  A couple of examples of fun food would be the breakfast quesadilla, crunchy french toast, and a breakfast Philly cheese steak. I looked over the lunch/dinner menu and it has a lot of things that looked tasty as well.  It isn't a huge menu, but ok overall.2. The flavor of the food.  I had the breakfast quesadilla with steak and I was quite pleased.  You get a huge serving because they use the biggest tortillas ever and layer them instead of folding them in half.  The quesadilla was stuffed full of eggs and cheese with an ok share of steak sprinkled throughout.  It could have used a bit more steak, especially for the $5 surcharge to add it, but overall it was pretty good.  The tortillas were crispy and held together nicely, even being stuffed.  My hubby got the crunchy french toast.  It was a fun twist on your average french toast.  It didn't blow my socks off, but it was average.  My hubby really enjoyed it though, for whatever that matters.3.  The prices.  The prices all seemed to be a $1 or 2 too high on the breakfast menu.  The food was ok and with good sized servings, but it seemed a bit high, especially on the kids menu.  The kid's breakfast is $7 and the lunch/dinner kids menu is $10.  I guess they are going for a more upscale place with the prices, but they just didn't seem to fit.4. The interior is pretty, especially right now with the Christmas decoration up.  There were big wreaths along the wall, huge snowflakes everywhere, and even some mistletoe!  It had a rustic cantina look mixed with a bit of modern leather accents.  It really was nicely decorated.5. The service is on the mediocre side.  Everyone we talked too was super friendly and polite.  The problem is they were also absent most of the time and a bit on the ditzy side.  My hubby had a cup of coffee that was never refilled or even offered to get a refill, and the same went for my glass of water.  We were checked on about half way through our meal and when the check arrived, but that was it.  I don't think we are demanding, but a refill every now and then is more than reasonable in my book.So over all, John Cutter has some good things going for it, but it has some misses as well.  The food is tasty, but a bit pricey.  The interior is lovely, but the service level is hit or miss.  When you average everything out, I think 3 stars is a good average.The food is decent, but that is if you can actually get service once seated, and if you get service it comes with a lot of bad attitude!I'd recommend skipping this place!UPDATE:  sent an email to Kristy Morrison, General Manager over a week ago and received NO ACKNOWLEDGEMENT---speaks volumes to the service we received......my first experience with this venue was this evening, Sunday, which is 1/2 price steak night.  Understandably, the venue was packed.  NOT understandably was the fact that 2/3 of the food we ordered never came, including one of our steaks! The potatoes arrived after the steaks that did manage to find their way to our table but the salad, along with a steak and the asparagus sadly must have been lost in transit.  When we attempted to voice our concerns to the manager, (after having asked to speak with her multiple times) she finally arrived at our table immediately ordering one of our party to calm down and another to sit down ( he had simply gotten up to go look for her at the same time she was arriving) and advised that she had already heard our complaint from the server and wasn't interested in hearing it again.  She offered to remove the items not received from the bill (seriously? Does this not fall under the category of 'duh'?) and offered a gift certificate for the inconvenience of the inconsistent service. Not surprisingly, we never received the gift certificate. She then attempted to discount the incredibly unacceptable service by indicating a full house and new staff. Young lady, Management 101: YOUR staffing issues are NOT the problem of your patrons; accept accountability and attempt to accommodate your clientele with respect and dignity. The only reason I gave this venue 1 star is so that my review would be posted. If enough patrons complain about the abysmal service this venue obviously considers acceptable, perhaps actual management will review its process and make some adjustments. Not holding my breath...and I WILL be calling in the morning to report the incredibly disrespectful manner in which this obviously unskilled manager spoke to the 80 year old gentleman at our table. There is a plethora of amazing steak houses in Las Vegas; there is NO NEED to patronize this one.

I come here every time I need a quick bite to eat at the Rio.  I usually just order up a 18 inch pizza. For about ~20 bucks you could feed 4-5 people, which is probably the best deal.  They also have sandwiches, salads, and all those regular deli type stuff.Best pizza I have ever had!!!! I'm not sure if it was because I was hungry but the pizza here was simply amazing!! They're open all night so it was nice when we were hungry at 4 in the morning. The workers were kind and helpful and we didn't get any rude looks when we were browsing their huge menu. They were patient with us even though it was 4am and we were a little drunk. A must have if you're ever in rio in the wee hours of the night and starving!This place was kind of hidden at first.  It is in the back/beside the Pho joint down in the bottom of the Rio Hotel/Casino.  After looking around at all the options of places to eat/drink, this was by thar the cheapest and fastest.  You could get salads, burgers, fries, sandwiches,  but most importantly slices of pizza.  The pizza slices were $5 and fast so that was the winner in my book.However, I suggest not ordering the garlic parm fries.  A friend of mine did and they just take their regular fries, dump way too much garlic powder on them, and dried parm.  BLAH.  That girl stuck for weeks.The salads here were great.  I suggest the greek salad.  I had many of them while there.

Restaurant name  Inaka Sushi
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
We were pretty excited when the signs for Inaka Sushi were going up!  Finally, a sushi place in our neck of the woods and an all-you-can-eat one too, no less!  (Even better, the Husband was more than familiar with their first location after being a regular there.)Joining us was Melissa G. and another friend from SoCal who never gets AYCE sushi ever.  The dinner menu is $23.95, which is cheaper than some of the other sushi restaurants around.It was pretty empty on a Saturday night, but we figured it was because of the location more so.The menu selection is pretty standard with appetizers, nigiri, sushi rolls, and ice cream included in the AYCE.Appetizers: * Age Tofu (Deep Fried Tofu With Tempura Sauce) - Not quite like other restaurants where it sits in broth with bonito flakes.  Rather it's slices of soft tofu, lightly deep-fried, and tempura dipping sauce.* Shrimp Tempura - Standard, nothing special.* Green Mussels (Baked Mussels with Special Mayonnaise) - When we ordered this, we thought it was just regular baked green mussels.  It's more like "Dynamite" because of the mayo sauce and served in a scallop shell.* Yakitori (Grilled Chicken on Skewers with Teriyaki Sauce) - The Husband ate all of them, so I guess it was okay.* Seafood Ragoon (Deep-Fried Mixed Fish and Cream Cheese Wrapped in Wonton Skin) - It had a stronger salmon taste, and a dipping sauce would have been a good complement to it.* Miso Soup* Cucumber Salad (Sliced Cucumber with Sesame Dressing) Nigiri:* Amaebi (Sweet Shrimp) - Limit of one order of two per person.  It wasn't exactly what I called amaebi, the raw sweet shrimp.  It's a fake and bad substitute of two pieces of cooked shrimp sitting on rice.* Albacore (White Tuna)* Cajun Albacore* Hamachi* Garlic Tuna* Ikura (Salmon Roe)* Saba (Mackerel)* Sake (Salmon)* Hotate (Scallop) - Before ordering this one, we asked if the scallops were small ones mixed up with stuff or the larger variety.  The waitress confirmed it was the larger variety sliced in half and laid over the rice.  Well, when she brought it over, it was the former variety and not what we wanted.  It's a good thing we only requested one order since we ended up not eating it.  The waitress said it was because she was new and didn't know.* Uni (Sea Urchin) - Limit of one order of two per person.From the first bite of sushi, we knew that we weren't going to be happy.  The sushi rice was mushy and lacked the vinegar that makes it sushi rice.  Over and over again, I was getting less than impressed with their rice.  Blah.Sushi Rolls:* Salmon Skin Handroll* Spider Roll (Soft Shell Crab, Crab Salad, Masago & Eel Sauce) - Melissa G. wasn't too impressed with their version as they use a different batter so it comes out a lot darker and not as tasty.  It was alright.* Something Wrong Roll (Deep Fried Assorted Dish Fish Roll with Spicy Sauce) - It's tasty because it's deep fried and sits in a bed of mayonnaise spicy sauce.* Catepillar Roll (Fresh Water Eel, Cucumber & Topped with Avocado and Eel Sauce)* Kiss The Ass (Spicy Spider Topped with Spicy Crab) - I didn't even realize there was a soft shell crab inside because the crab concoction dominates the roll.Before we started ordering any of the rolls, I asked the waitress if they used Sriracha to make the hot sauce.  After much confusion, she finally went to the sushi chef to ask.  They were making a big deal out of it as if I was asking for the secret recipe to their spicy sauce when all I wanted to know is if they use it at all.  The final answer, yes.  I'm not a big fan of the stuff in my sushi.Dessert:* Green Tea, Plum, and Mango Ice Cream - Pretty good ice cream, and we all had our share.  Good stuff!Service could use some improvement.  With only two parties present, our waitress was too busy socializing than getting our order or refilling our tea and water.  Some orders were forgotten and needed some reminding.  The other waitress was a bit pushy about rushing me to clear a plate off as she waited so she could take it away.Overall, we were less than impressed and won't be going back.  It was just disappointing and screwing up the basic sushi rice is a bad sign.Damn it!!!! I was praying that this place would be at least "okay" since it's located near mountain's edge and there is nothing out here! I'm not exaggerating when I say the best part of the meal was when they notified me that after the second beer, the third would be free. They messed up rice... RICE! How the...? It was hard to even swallow the rice; it was too dry! Uncle Ben's minute made rice has treated me better. Also, no Uni, no toro despite it being pictured on an advertisement, and no super white OR and other fatty fish that could make up for it.I ate a lot of Nigiri on the AYCE menu and nothing really tasted fresh. I've eaten a lot of sushi in my day and the fish here was NOTICEABLY different IN A BAD WAY. I know. I know; all you can eat sushi is not the way to go if you want good sushi (under most circumstances), but this place was something else. I wasn't even going to try a roll after the nigiri, but I went with a half roll of something on the spicy side. The roll that they presented me with was something u might find in an Albertson's; wrapped up in plastic to take to go (maybe even worse). Let me emphasize: DAMN IT! I was really hoping, despite the not-so-great reviews that this place would be okay or at least bearable. I won't be back. Very simply: the place sucks. And that's too bad.Hopefully one day when I drive by in the future there will be a big banner that says "Under New Management" or something because they must know. They must know that they're setting standards that no one should be proud of. **sigh** the whole experience was disappointing. At least the free beer has helped mask my utter discontent with this place!!!! The service wasn't bad but who the hell cares when the food blows ass.I won't be back even tho it's seconds away. Womp. Womp. Womp.

This location is located in the classy around the area of the Camelback Colonnade area. With many fast food options and restaurants in the area this Wendy's location has seemed to do very well. The interior is updated and the location is always clean. The service is fast, friendly and a great bang for the buck. I think Wendy's has probably one of the best breakfast as far as options and quality food. The only issue I have with this location is my orders are not always up to par. My food thru the drive thru only has been served cold or prepared wrong. Meaning if I ask for no sauce they will still add the sauce. It happens all the time. Other then that everything else is all good.

I just got home from an awesome time at Wayne's Sushi Bar. I can't believe we were here for 3 hours.Me n Lily D arrived here at 9pm. I came here after I had dinner at home. Lily was on a mission to satisfy my craving for some sashimi, since I had been craving some raw fish after seeing some pics she had posted.  What we ordered:-1 large Asahi-1 large Sapporo-2 large nigori sake + 1 on the house-1 hamachi jalapeno-1 ahi tuna salad-1 white tuna jalapeno-1 smoked bbq pork-1 toro nigiri-2 uni/quail egg/sake shootersWayne and his wife were great hosts/servers/chefs. I didn't expect to have such a great time tonight. They busted out the karaoke. Lily, Wayne, his wife, and some of the other guests showed is their vocal skills!! The fish was only about 4 stars, but the environment was 5 stars!! I made a comment to Wayne about giving me the slab of TORO and he gave us a plate of toro on the house!! The karaoke started towards the end of the night. Wayne, his wife, Lily D., and some of the other customers bust out their vocal skills on the mic. It was almost like being at a sushi bar in San Francisco!!

Review Text :
Ich gebe ja zu, dass das riesige "Free Wifi" Schild am Eingang nicht wenig an meiner Entscheidung für das sonst fast unscheinbare Villager beteiligt war. Es regnete in Strömen, ich hatte Hunger und etwas Zeit totzuschlagen. Meine Erwartungen waren irgendwo zwischen "Hauptsache warm" und "Essen, egal was" angesiedelt. Dementsprechend war ich beim Blick auf die Karte doch überrascht. Was zunächst nach buntem Küchenwirrwarr ausschaut, hat sich dann als echt toll überlegte Karte herausgestellt, die zugegeben nicht ganz in eine Schublade zu quetschen war. Ich entschied mich für die Springrolls mit Rotkohl und Walnüssen auf Rote-Bete-Apfel-Sauce. Wow, das war doch mal was anderes als das übliche Burger-Sandwich-Salat-Einerlei. Geschmeckt hat's super, mein Mittag war gerettet. Nur das Bezahlen hat dann ewig gedauert, obwohl ich direkt neben der Theke saß. Aber gut, geregnet hatte es immer noch und das Internetz sorgte für Kurzweile. Ich würde wiederkommen.

Restaurant name  Bâton Rouge
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
WHY? WHY? WHY? I used to go to Baton Rouge for the ribs but after living in the US and getting a taste of wood smoked ribs, I was done with utilitarian ribs. This week I went back since there's a Baton Rouge right outside the office with the team. I had forgotten the insane prices at this restaurant for straight a no frills trying to be everything to everyone menu. One shouldn't have to remortgage his home to eat out at lunch.That being said, it was an office lunch and I was going. This Baton Rouge also has a very nice terrace to eat outside and enjoy the nice summer weather and make you forget you are downtown. The service is acceptable but they fail to distinguish between lunch service and evening service. If your restaurant is between two large corporate glass towers, you know your lunch crowd is a working crowd that doesn't always have time for a long lunch. On to the food...I ordered the NY steak which is a beautiful cut of meat and also easily prepared. The fat alone can flavor it and it doesn't need much more than some spices. So done deal right? You would be SOOOOOOOOOOOO WRONG. When I got my steak just from the sear marks I could tell that this steak had been constantly thrown around the grill. From the way the fat strip was curling off the meat I could tell the steak had not finished thawing before being grilled - which rendered the meat tasteless. There were no salts, peppers or spices. EPIC FAIL. The potato, and I'm only speculating, tasted like last night's oven baked potato because it was so dry and bland that even the quarter of a cup of sour cream, cheese and bacon dressing on it couldn't save this potato, which also had no seasoning. No third party veggies were made available. Louisiana touch, my ass. Half an ear of corn would have been a nice southern touch with my steak. But there's NOTHING Southern or Cajun on their menu.I'll blame consumers for this disaster in my plate. Why? Because no one ever bitches and complains about their bad food quality they are being served in restaurants, especially for a 38$ NY steak. Like I said to my colleague and former chef, I can make a 5 dollar strip loin from a super-market into a feast you'll think I got from a pro butcher. I cringe that a restaurant cook can't have steaks at room temperature ready for lunch time - if your boss is too much of a cheap bastard to buy it fresh - and season them appropriately to taste and for the sake of all that is good in life when you drop a steak on a grill, the next time you touch it is to flip it and after that to remove it - stop paddling and twiddling the meat, you will ruin it. Same for a potato. If you can't bake a fucking potato... GO HOME. What's so hard with crusting it with olive oil and coarse salt and make the tatter explode with extra flavor?Why am I bitching? Cause that plate cost me 38$ plus tip and all I got was a badly prepped steak and an old dry potato. For 30$ I made all 3 Rib-Eyes, Duck Sausage, Beef Ribs and potatoes at home and we foodgasmed for hours. For a single plate at 38$ plus tip, I'm expecting some added value to the experience, not leftovers. What a total complete ripoff to be charged so much dinero for such lack of care and passion. Again another establishment that values form over function. I'd rather eat at a shack that serves me great awesome tasting food in a paper plate than go to an upscale looking restaurant made for corporate power-lunchers but serves me barely edible badly prepared  low quality products.A lame 1 outta 5 stars

Review Text :
Been coming here for years and it never seems to lessen in quality or service. The decor used to be a lot tackier with the stuffed bear, moose and horse heads but has calmed down considerably over the years (to my dismay!). The servers are prompt and really friendly- the type of server where when it comes to tip, you open up your wallet and say "take all the monies!"We were a party of four and ordered two gyro plates (each has two pitas), a calimari, and a tzaziki. So. Much. Food. The plates are crazy packed with fries, rice, the gyros, a massive salad with your feta, olive and peppers. It's perfect for two people, but an ordeal for one. We ordered the larger calimari to share and again, way more was given than what was needed to feed four people. They were crisp and fresh, super light, and totally hit the spot. The only criticism is that the smaller pieces were slightly overdone, as it took on a more rubbery texture. But that could just be me trying to be an amateur food critic.Just go-- and get ready to roll out of this place. Or if you're normal, you'll limit yourself and ask for a takeout box.Marven's is a pretty old school traditional place, a family sort of restaurant. They don't take reservations and there is usually a line out the door. The portions are enormous and food is very consistent and reliable. And I guarantee that you have never seen a bigger portion of calamari in your life. Note that the calamari does not automatically come with tzatziki so you need to order this separately. Overall Marven's is a pretty solid place, however it is not particularly inexpensive and the line ups are long and I'm convinced that it is really worth all this. However, they do do takeout which is a good option if you need to get your calamari fix.

Review Text :
One of the Montreal's most well known steakhouses became the site of our most epic dinner during my friend's bachelor party weekend. In the midst of planning for the dinner, there was a tossup decision between this place and cross town rival Gibby's (http://www.yelp.ca/biz/gibbys-restaurant-montreal). The deliberation ended with Queue de Cheval for one thing: amazing service. From the phone reservation to greeting us at the door to the end of the meal, they did one heck of a job in accommodating our party of 12 hungry men.From the outside into the lobby, it's easy to see how beautiful this restaurant really is. In true steakhouse fashion, there are various cuts of meat from all parts of the world on display, something a true meat connoisseur can surely appreciate. We were able to get a spot on the second floor facing the street and the restaurant was like many other upscale steakhouses: trendy decor, well dressed patrons and wait staff, a lively ambiance just buzzing with activity. Generally speaking, the food always takes precedence in any restaurant but in places like this, service is of the utmost importance. The wait staff was quick and handled everything with ease, we almost never had to ask for anything as water was filled quickly, bread was refilled automatically, and there was never any attitude. Our main waiter was sharp, humorous, and extremely knowledgeable about virtually every item on the menu and was able to make some killer recommendations for drinks and food. We decided to pass on their appetizers, a majority of which would sully our carnivorous appetite for the one thing we came for - steak. Almost all of us were sold on the 20oz Lou's Cut ($54), which is the place's most popular steak.Along with the steak we ordered multiple sides of creamed corn ($12), truffle and parmesan fries ($7), garlic mashed potatoes ($5), along with a heaping of steak sauces: veal and truffle reduction ($6), cognac peppercorn ($6), and a cabernet sauvignon demi glace ($6) and staring at us was a hell of a meal.Everything was fantastic. The creaminess of the garlic mash, coupled by the delicious sauteed garlic spinach was melt in your mouth good. There were multiple foodgasms galore over the Lou's Cut, a hearty Colorado imported hunk of steak heaven in it's medium rare glory, juicy and went great with everything. The steak sauces weren't even all that necessary, but once added, there was no going back. Every bite was enhanced, the flavors were so rich, it was just the perfect amount of food; life was suddenly perfect.   Along with the Australian red and whites we sipped throughout the night, including 4 orders every side and a Lou's cut, the price we paid (sans the bachelor of course) was a very reasonable $82 per person. The conversation was as excellent as the food which was stellar as the service. Steakhouses might feel a tad more expensive in Montreal, mainly due to the importing of all of the meat, but when in town, this is one of the best places for steak period.Here's a parting thought for everyone: http://www.yelp.ca/biz_photos/Ek4sVcvmACWp8P1yizjwZg?select=NCkeuXRvI3XEOftyy2x7EQQuelle dommage... as the French would say.  Like watching a gorgeous souffle collapse before your eyes, this was the experience at Queue De Cheval.   Brace yourselves.A business partner in Montreal wanted to take some colleagues and me to dinner after a particularly successful event we co-sponsored.  He was quite proud to take us to this steakhouse proclaiming it to be the best steak in the city.  We walked in hungry and wide-eyed, the smell of the cigar bar pleasantly (really) entering the lobby/butcher shop in the front of the restaurant.The first thing I took note of was the meat case that sold filet mignon for $79/lb.  Outback steakhouse this is not.We were seated upstairs.  The restaurant seemed relatively empty for 9pm on a Friday night, so we got a very nice table by the front window overlooking the bronze horse statue (queue de cheval is French for The Horse's Tail after all).  The decor and ambiance is beautifully done.  Acres of rich woods.  'Bookcases' piled to the ceiling with wine bottles.  Artwork adorned the walls that befit the restaurant's name.  The centerpiece is a huge stainless steel funnel that encompasses the cast-iron grill on the main floor.  A spiral staircase encircles this chimney to get you to the dimly lit, warm and rustic second floor.Our pleasant waiter handed us our menus and then brought our first round of drinks.  He went on to explain the steaks on the menu like any other high end steakhouse.  They have corn fed beef from Colorado, grass fed beef from Nebraska and 'kobe' beef from Australia.  Kobe can only be from Japan, so I was a little suspicious.  He showed us several cuts of beef on a platter as well as what can only be described as a mermaid tail.  Jamaican lobster tails that were 2lbs on their own.  They also have Maine lobsters starting at 3.5lbs and going up to 6.  Price of entry for these?  $65/lb.Enjoying our beers, our garcon came back and took our orders.  The table ordered 3 Canadian filet mignons ($38) while I ordered a grass fed, bone on NY Strip ($53).  At the waiter's behest, we ordered 3 sides for the table - Asparagus, garlic mashed potatoes and sauteed mushrooms.  The sides were from $12 to $15 each.Standing on ceremony, Pablo brought us our uncooked steaks to look at, telling us they would be served to us in about 30 minutes.  Yep, they were steaks.  Thanks bro.Finally, our food arrived.  A steak on a plate, adorned with nothing but a split bulb of roasted garlic.  Nothing more.  Here is where things went horribly, horribly wrong (well, relatively - no one died).  I cut, nay, SAWED into my steak.  I was not entirely impressed with how difficult it was to get through this meat.  At first I thought it was overcooked, but it just turned out to be tough.  More shocking were when the sides arrived.  The asparagus plate held 8 small spears.  The garlic mashed came in a small cast-iron urn holding perhaps two small servings and lastly a cup of wet looking mushrooms.  I took my two allotted spears of asparagus and meager tablespoons of potatoes.  The asparagus was simply grilled.  TOO simply grilled.  Unseasoned, bland, and shockingly overcooked.  At $2 a spear, pretty ridiculous.  The potatoes were genuinely good.  The best thing on my plate.  And that's sad.  I didn't have any mushrooms as they just didn't appeal to me.  I continued to fight through my steak.  The flavor was fine having been cooked to my requested medium-rare.  However, It was woefully underseasoned and I added salt.  But overall, it was tough, gristly and disappointing.  If I were paying for the meal, I would have sent it back.  I probably would have sent this steak back at a diner.  I bit my tongue and smiled as I did not want to embarrass my host and his restaurant choice.We left after coffee and this morning, my colleagues and I had breakfast and discussed the previous night's meal.  I was glad to find I was not the only one wholly dissatisfied with their food.  I live in NY and have been to many a high end steak house there and elsewhere.  They're all better.  Hell, The Keg in Old Montreal was much better.  I can fire a much more mouth watering steak from Whole Foods in my own backyard.  Queue de Cheval seems to rest on pomp and circumstance, and sky high prices.  It lacked substance entirely.  I think some people will brainwash themselves to think they are eating amazing food just because the price is inflated.  They should rename it The Horse's Ass.  I've given them a single star.  A reasonably priced restaurant with the same quality food, I would have given two.  If you want to feel like a rock star, get a steak dinner at The Keg and then spend the money you would have squandered getting bottle service at one of the swank clubs nearby.I had been to the Queue de Cheval a couple of times several years ago when they were located on Rene-Levesque, and although I never ranked it among the best steak houses I've eaten at, it was always very good.This weekend, a group of friends and I tried it again (it is temporarily located inside the tacky nightclub, 1234 on de la Montagne) and I regret to say that it was one of the WORST meals I have had in a restaurant in a very long time.If I explained everything that went wrong, this review would be 15 paragraphs, so I'll keep it as short as possible: the meals came out at different times (the last person was literally served 30 minutes before the first), the food was not good (bland, overcooked steak, dry & tasteless lobster carpaccio), the service staff was not only disorganized but arrogant, and to top it all off, they seated us next to the nightclub entrance and opened the velour curtains at 10:00 pm, at which time we were freezing from the draft, annoyed by the cheezy eurotrash, and bothered by the scantily-clad 19 year old girls shoving their way into the club.The most unbelievable part of it all was when we complained to the manager. He called the owner to ask him what to do, and the owner who passed on the following message to our table: "I don't care if they didn't like it, tell them to never come eat here again."This restaurant is NO LONGER a top-tier steakhouse. What it is now is a hugely overpriced restaurant in a nightclub with sub-par food. Horrible.

I had visions of the ghost of Harry Caray dancing in my brain, the day had been consumed with downers and baseball, cartoon drunks hyped on the American dream, we were chasing it where it lay somewhere buried in the heart of the west side, strip malls and freeways. It was a glorious windy day for an LA Dodgers versus the DBacks spring training game at the former's stadium in Glendale. Drunk and raving at the equally rabid dodgers fans there was no time to eat, only to refuel on beer and hatred, and after beating them for 8 straight innings we both decided that it was high time to leave our seats and quest for food.  After a quick jaunt down the freeway, and at my friend's recommendation we sought out Fannooogieez (true spelling). We stumbled out of my friends cluttered Saturn, smoke billowing out of the interior ala Cheech/Chong and practically crawled inside. The place is your standard garden variety family friendly sort of westside sports bar. There were a cluster of black motorcycles parked on the sidewalk, and an empty patio as we sauntered up to the entrance, inside hunkered numerous tables sparsley populated with slavering sports fans eyes glued to the various television screen idols. I stared numbly and followed inside to a large booth and plopped down exhuastedly. It took a while but eventually our lackadaisical server came around, but in that interim that seemed like an eternity to my ravenous stomach, we had occupied ourselves with a trivia game playing to no one in particular on one of the tube screens, until another player signed in and started kicking our asses. We were starting to feel pretty smug about our ability until "Brady" signed in. Scanning the bar, covertly mind you, we couldnt find any other players. We focused on the game, getting progressivley behind, and more vociferous. There seemed to be an inverse relationship between our trivia score and our bar tab, one went up, the other went down. Finally I couldn't take being emasculated by this repugnant Brady any longer, I feigned a cigarette break (our score so far behind any more seemed..well..trivial). As I stood up and stretched I scanned the bar, each face intently, I gave the bar an "occular pat down" if you will and successively cleared each individual, and then it dawned on me. Brady was no mere mortal, we were competing against the AI itself. This was realized after about 3 rounds and over an hour or so of furitvely stealing glances at our fellow patrons suspiciously. I felt foolish, but consoled myself with the places decidedly good chicken wings. In the end, all that mattered was that I knew in my heart and soul, that if the moon were made of a plate of barbecued chicken wings I would eat it, heck I'd go back for seconds!

Restaurant name  1855 Saloon and Grill

Review Text :
So the saloon was pops' idea, and the sad thing is it is a really good looking restaurant - gorgeous interior, great pictures from the 18 and early 1900's, a wood fired grill, and a great atmosphere.  But it is all show and no substance.1855 has no soul. I've been here three times now and each time left me disappointed.  The first time I ordered Bruschetta and they served it to me first before telling me they were unable to toast it because their grill was down.  It was not good.  The second time I was at 1855 I ordered the Reuben and it may have been good except the toast they served it on was soggy on the bottom, like it had been sitting for a while before being served.  Plus no thousand island dressing, and that might as well be a crime where I come from.  Pops wasn't happy with his Panini, and I gotta say it didn't even look appetizing.. another crime in my book.  A new lead cook is in order.  Possibly stricter adherence to food ethics.  1855 is a mighty good looking restaurant with nothing to offer once the lust is gone.  Don't you just hate that?We live in CG and used to come here often. Their food and service are very inconsistent. I have had excellent meals and not so excellent meals. Same with the service.I have had their steak with the stuffed shrimp on top and it was sensational! Their wood fire pizza is also delicious! Burgers are good too. Their fried pickles are delish but the breeding falls off. We ordered their app sampler once and that was not good at all. It was cold and tasted very processed, definitely frozen. Service is also hit or miss. Our table service has always been good. Bar service is a little different. They have one male bartender that is extremely arrogant and seems to be "above it all". He acts as if he could care less, injects himself into conversations and can be condescending. He does however make great drinks... When he's not chatting up the waitstaff or the attractive single women. That being said, I have never had terrible service or a bad meal here. I will be back. Depending on the night you could have three stars or five stars.Just left after waiting 15 minutes for a server that never came. We were seated outside. Saw a hostess after 15 min and said our server never came. Said she would check on it. One minute later the table that had been sat 15 min after us had their order taken. We waited a few more minutes and decided to leave. We went to the hostess stand and asked for a manager just so they knew what would happen. When the manager came we told her what happened. She said sorry and it must have been a shift change issue. She didn't try to get us to stay and didn't seem to care at all.Very disappointing. The food that we saw coming out looked good but we'll never know. We had been wanting to try this place for awhile after stopping in for a drink awhile ago when there was live music. Sadly I will never come back and I will make sure to tell people not to try it either.

Nice crust. Not too thin, not heavy. A paper placemat menu with 70 pizza options (somehow this already makes me love you). All the ones I've tried are fresh and the combinations tasty. Sort of an old Italian Quebecois family diner vibe with big pitchers, dignified but not fancy. They'll treat you right and fill you up and possibly pass on some life advice with the take-out menu. Come as you are.If the weather is fair and you sit in the patio you'll have one of the homiest views of downtown Montreal, looking out on Phillips Square, just off the press of St Catherine's. A lovely mellow old school place for pizza pie.Most everyone loves great pizza but can't always agree what that is.  Il Focolaio meets most of my basic pizza must haves.Crust that leans to the thin side but retains some thickness and texture.Quality ingredients and a balance of sauce. Over 50 choices from anchovies to escargot Crisp, fresh and lightly dressed salads large enough for two as an accompanimentQuickly cooked in a wood fired oven. A wine list that is fairly priced by the glass or bottleIn addition Il Focolaio has waiters that know what they are doing and are eager to accommodate their customers.It can get a little to noisy inside but when everyone is talking about the great food - that's to be expected.

Review Text :
Been here when it was Vinnie's, but finally got around to coming back to try it under its new name:  Finz.  Parking is sort of a nightmare depending on what night you go on.  This particular night, it wasn't so much busy, it's just that the people the parked before did not make an effort to stay in their spaces.  In a tight parking lot, this is detrimental.  We did manage to find a space.Upon walking in, we were warmly greeted and seated right away.  They were having trivia on a Tuesday night.  It was almost halfway in so we figured it had started pretty early (7 or 7:30).I honestly couldn't remember what the Vinnie's dining room setup looked like, but the current Finz set up was cozy and casual.  The menu was pretty extensive - took a while to read through, but had lots of options.  You can get anything from a decently priced sandwich to a sizable seafood dinner (with items at market prices).There was a yelp check-in special where we got 6 free wings.  Our waitress was super nice and gave them to us... a little while later, the manager wanted to see my phone, but no problems.It was Shrimp night on Tuesdays so I got a basket.  They were breaded nicely and not too greasy.... they came with a tartar dipping sauce and I chose a baked potato as my side.  I was pretty satisfied with my meal and would come back to order it again.  The wings we got were good - decided to try the parmesan garlic wings.  Light on the sauce (in a good way) they proved to be tasty - I'm sure the other flavors probably would have had more kick to them, but they were cooked nicely.Overall, Finz gets a solid 4 from me.  Matthews is lucky to have a place like this that is centrally located and easy to get to.

I have been to the WW in Asheville I Guess more than 30 times always great food service and drinks. BUT... there is something about The WW At this location and one other it seems like it must be KFC.     IT all started about 230pm I guess I had passed by this location a few times but, decided to stop. They had a all u can eat wing and soup I think (I am trying to forget). FIRST THE SERVER DID NOT HAVE A CLUE. So I get to the buffet line 4 dried out wings and no soup. I stopped 2 employees and asked about the food they looked at me like I was from MARS...I and I guess 4 people waited for wings nothing came out. I LEFT 3 dollars on the table for the tea and was out of there. I CALLED THE PLACE a few moments later and spoke with a bartender who sounded like he was on crack that said he was 'in charge right now"HE kept repeating over and over what I was saying so there must have been some sort of medication... issue so I hung up.          I called their Corp office and spoke with "David" who said he was a district manager he said the bartender should not have been in charge and laughed about it   ????After he tried to sweep it under the rug he invited me to another location and told me it would be better and after about 3 weeks sent me a letter with a gift card..         So after about a month I was stuck in traffic pulled off and decided to give then one more chance... NOT goin to go into the terrible service while there you can message me if anyone wants details.. Anyway got wings to go got home opened the bag and a ROACH CRAWLED OUT DAMM. !!!!!! I called the CORP GUY and he said there is no bugs in that store...I ASKED HIM THEN WHAT JUST CRAWLED OUT A CHICKEN WING? Again he invited me to the location on Ardslye his FLAGSHIP LOCATION NOT ANY BETTER I GAVE UP ON WILD WINGS IN THIS AREA

Review Text :
I had to join Yelp just so that I could write this review. It's important to me to warn the people about Filibertos just West of Dobson on Southern. I drove through yesterday and asked about the special. It was two beef tacos with a drink for $2.99. Who could resist? I thought they must be small tacos so I also tacked on a carne asada taco. Oh, my tummy protests even now. I consumed the food items at 3:30pm and at 6pm began to feel really uncomfortable. I had to take a walk. Within four hours, I was retching and squirting from both ends at the same time. Food poisoning? I say YES. Drive thru with extreme caution. Note: I've eaten at Filiberto's on Broadway by Hardy many times and have never gotten sick... maybe a little discomfort but never the double projectile.

I had never, ever been recognized because of Yelp...until a few days ago!I was frankly concerned that the first time someone recognized me because of Yelp, it would be in connection with one of my less "flattering" reviews.And I take very seriously, the old adage "never mess with people that prepare and handle your food"!So I was surprised and delighted (and more than little relieved) that my "first time" was with Jennifer, at this Paradise Bakery outpost!Jennifer was sweet and friendly, she was even complimentary about my humble attempts to create interesting reviews!I not only appreciate her reading my little stories, I really appreciated her saying "Hi"!The Beautiful Carin and I used to frequent this PB when we lived in Scottsdale Mountain, but I hadn't been here in some time.We would have a croissant or a muffin and drink refill after refill of PB's very good coffee, read our Sunday papers and plot and plan the week ahead.It was and is a great spot to just hang out!One of my clients suggested it as a place to meet...and since they have pretty decent baked goodies, good coffee, free wifi and, of course, Jennifer (and a lot of nice people like Jennifer helping you at PB), I said "why not".Have you noticed that almost no one (including me, BTW) meets at their offices anymore...or at least rarely?Out of 8 client meetings in Phoenix this week, 3 were at an office...the rest took place at a coffee shop, or a restaurant, or on a park bench late at night (OK, I'm kidding about that last one...probably).This location is my favorite of all the PB's (and judging from my PB Frequent Flyer Card, I have clearly been to nearly all of them, so I think I'm qualified to judge).Drop by, grab a Lemon Poppyseed Muffin (unless you have a drug test scheduled for later in the day), a bottomless cup of coffee, fire up the iPad and make this place your office away from the office.And say "Hi" to my new friend, Jennifer!

Review Text :
The wife and I went here for a New Years dinner for two... it's pretty much the only fine dining place in Goodyear outside of the Wigwam (and they only had NYE dinners that night). I feel bad that the company around us got more of our attention then the chef at the table but it defiantly was an enjoyable experience. The price point is average for Teppanyaki dinner and the service here is top notch. I had no issues on my order or anything simple like refills or cleanliness. The sushi was well crafted and the steak and chicken combo with fried rice was quite tasty. Probably the best fried rice I have had in the valley of the sun. My wife enjoyed her Mai Tai's and dish as well. This is a nice place to have a unique date night and I would suggest that yelper's give it a try.

Review Text :
Repeat after me: 'chen-toh-tray'. Accent the first and third syllables. That seems to roughly be the pronunciation for this venue. It shouldn't have been to difficult to realize that it's Italian for 'one hundred three', the street address here. Duh. Hey - I never said I wasn't dense.A shockingly sun-drenched Friday morning found me sitting here, surrounded by various marketers and techies, slurping on a big ol' mug of steaming Americano, and later wolfing down a bacon focaccia.Considering our party took up one massive rectangular table, then later metastasized to another smaller table or two, the staff was considerably patient and accommodating. Not only that, since #EdCM was ostensibly a networking event, everyone traded seats frequently, yet our final bill came out perfectly - no mystery additions and no missing items.While the most I can report regarding my food was that it was satisfying (because it was)... I'd suggest that the most noteworthy aspects of this joint are the airy high ceilings, the enormous white pillars that stretch from floor to ceiling, and the free wi-fi. I realize the latter isn't an architectural design element, but it might as well be. To me, it's no weirder asking, "Hey, does that place have a roof?" than, say, "So, does that business have free interwebz?"And to answer your unspoken question, no... I am -not- a cyborg. I just play one on TV.*--* This is a patent lie. I've only played myself on TV here and there. And once on a Margaret Cho DVD. Truth.

2.55 StarsHong Kong Bistro is one of those restaurants that is nearby and I thought I had already reviewed it.They are a pretty basic Chinese restaurant with decor one step above the typical hole in the wall joint.Expect average quality and prices, no more, no less.The people here are friendly.

Review Text :
I wanted so badly to hate this place. You have no idea. And this doesn't come from a place of hate in my heart. I don't hate "Scottsdale." The concept. The place. Or the people.Ani Di Franco says "If I were you, you're exactly who I'd be..."So if I was both a city and an undeniable DB (which are equally possible coexisting phenomena considering my paunch and treatment of other humans at large), I could indeed be Scottsdale. I could represent everything about it. But instead, some rich ladies and gentlemen, developers and career hype-hawkers no doubt, decided to build a representation on Camelback Rd so I could go on just being me, Dally G. Scottlas, Atlas' retard cousin, I am not. No, I did not just use that word.  But, as I said, I don't hate it. I do hate hype. I do hate, kind of with all my heart, the fucking dumb asses who stand in line for video game systems, Starwars movies, and iPhones. So the 2000+ people who showed up at the pool at the W this weekend are the unjustifiably more socially acceptable versions of the 3 week line-standing uberdorks. I know I'm making a lot of friends here.  So when I arrived at Sushi Roku for a "press junket," I was like, I already hate this place. Just because I'm a judgmental asshole. And I wasn't greeted by a TOTAL FUCKING TOOL. By that I mean, some fucking asshole in a horrible, horrible tie who later introduced himself as an assistant GM, would not fucking acknowledge my presence as I'm leaning on the podium. Dude, the people at the front are more important than the famous chefs and stingray skin place settings! Get a fucking clue douche-nozzle! ARG! It wasn't until the main attraction arrived and took the bull by the horns that we were able to break into his extraordinarily minuscule external sphere of recognition or comprehension. Ok, so I have no idea what a press junket is... But I'm calling it that because it makes me sound like a pimp. And I need more of that in my life. But it was a night for press people from around town to come and check it out and get everything comped and interact superficially because they all seem to hate/judge each other. Who can blame them, really. And it was fucking marvelous. I loved the place. As a vegetarian on a meaty night, they hooked my skanky ass up. I had a breath-taking eggplant dish. Some tofu variety platter that would probably be about $15 I imagine, which was good but I would have to know the price before I could recommend it. I had a mushroom tofu steak and a fairly delish dessert. It was all very good. The seaweed salad was good but loud. Yes, very loud in my head. Our waiter, while it seemed that he had never worked in the service industry before, was genuinely nice and totally helpful with my surely annoying veggieness. We got a pseudo sneak peek of the pool area during a party that was going on. I didn't quite understand why it was so hush hush when there was already a huge party going on but whatever. The place is fucking rad. Bring a date there. Expect him/her to put out. Not because he'll/she'll feel obligated but because everything is sexier there. It's just totally amazing. The people walking around the rest property were as snobby as you'd expect and yes, they are judging you. But everyone should check this place out once. I guess this is sort of a review of my experience at the W as well. You'll probably live. Check it out.I've always felt there are two items that are consistent indicators of the overall quality of a sushi restaurant... saba or uni. I took the saba test and Sushi Roku got low marks. The fishier the saba generally the less awesome your sushi meal will be and sure enough, my saba was pretty fishy and the overall meal was edible, but not stellar. Granted I was eating sushi in landlocked Scottsdale, so perhaps the joke is on me. Alas I was tired from my travels and was in desperate need of food, so I can't say I thought about my dining decision before going in. The interior is pretty sleek (as is the decor of the whole hotel) so I'd say it'd still be a fun spot for a date. Our server was pretty cool too. Final word: If you're staying in the hotel, don't feel like branching out, and have no price sensitivity, it's fine.OK so where do I start first off the place looks cool and has a really truly awesome assortment of food on the menu. Plenty to choose from including carpoccios which are my fav. I ordered the tuna carpaccio = the fish was sliced too thick and had what tasted like a salty bottle bought ponzu. Dont order this if you want carpaccio Yellowtail carpaccio = delicious sliced thin and had the oils and herbs perfect. A good size too. Miso soup = the same as everywhere else The Katana roll = dude this thing is freaking amazing but for 16 bucks I dont know soo good though. some beef wrapped in asparagus= soo bad I took it back Spicy Tuna was over minced like mush All in all the meal was good but for 70 bucks I left hungry and pissed The waiter was soo weird and creepy. I was there with my gf and a friend and he asked my friend if she was having a rough night, WTF!!! Dont ask a girl if she was having a rough night. Might as well said you look like shit. So weird. Oh and the fact he only talked to my gf when he was addressing any of us. Talking to him was like pulling teeth soo damn weird. I did go back a second time and had good food and a waitress with a name with like all syllables. I wish I could remember it because she really is the bestThe ambience is a feast for the eyes and for the touch, this much is true, but one is paying a very high price for this exclusivity.  While I liked waiting in the lobby- couldn't sit at the sushi counter until it was open for dinner service at 5:30p- I did notice that for a venue that strives to project a life of luxury, housekeeping hadn't come by to clean food debris off of the coffee table (closest to the sushi restaurant's host desk).  Not even when a rep came by to alert me to a bar menu sitting on the table and asked me if I had wanted anything from the bar- she had to have noticed the mess?!I ordered a $9.50 spider roll (soft-shelled crab), a $10 veggie tempura app, and a $19 baked lobster roll, all priced at 50% for one week during their 1-year anniversary.  They're all good, and factoring in the ostentatious surroundings, I'd pay $9.50 for the soft-shelled crab roll, but I'd put my foot down on the other two.  50% maybe, but $19 for a five-piece lobster roll?  Yes, it was very tasty, and yes, the cream sauce was orgasmic, but for $19, I expect moments from the restaurant scenes of "The Ugly Truth" or "When Harry Met Sally," take your pick.If you've money to burn or have someone else paying for the bill, then this is your sushi stop near Old Town Scottsdale.Located in the W Hotel in Old Town Scottsdale, this hipster hangout is always busy.  I recommend a reservation if you're planning to dine here.  The Better Half and I drop in here from time to time.  Since I don't eat Sushi, I order:Ji-Dori Chicken Skewers withTeriyaki Sauce - $10http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/DwP10iEz5LGf3fhcVQZm0Q?select=x_60nAIMvJX9k_s9HAPiOAFilet Mignon wrapped Asparagus with Soy Mirin Sauce - $15http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/DwP10iEz5LGf3fhcVQZm0Q?select=19cHPtx8ahwZTPC5xIARFQhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/DwP10iEz5LGf3fhcVQZm0Q?select=_4XhXTuYKQnypHmylm-mQgAnd for Dessert, a warm Chocolate Cake...yum!http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/DwP10iEz5LGf3fhcVQZm0Q?select=KoyBtoSTBrhM2dLD8zs_PAhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/DwP10iEz5LGf3fhcVQZm0Q?select=iKBiwthdGtENIqWfGK1V1AThe Chicken Skewers are very tasty.  The Teriyaki Sauce they are glazed are sweet and have the right amount of "sour" kick to it to balance the flavor.  The Filet Mignon wrapped Asparagus is awesome...the Filet is tender and juicy and the Asparagus compliments it well.  Of course, the Chocolate Cake dessert is a nice ending for the meal.The service can be a bit slow at times, depends on the server.  Generally speaking, it's pretty good considering how busy they are.The people watching here is pretty good...watching all of the hipsters is hilarious.Return Factor - 93%Sushi Roku used to be our favorite sushi restaurant in the area. We've been here to celebrate an anniversary, a birthday, and fun date nights whenever we got the craving for sushi. Unfortunately, the quality seems to have declined in the past year. Our most recent experience left a bad taste in our mouth and I don't think we'll be returning any time soon.We came here on a Friday night before the Christmas holiday and were surprised the restaurant was playing such loud club music. We joked that we felt we were eating on the dance floor. The ambiance just wasn't as inviting or classy as it was previously. Things went downhill from here.. The Katana Roll was not as flavorful as it has been in the past and the presentation was different. For a $17 "specialty sushi roll" we were expecting something special and were left quite disappointed.The Caterpillar Roll was also not as good as it has been in the past. I could've sworn that this inside out roll used to include crab meat inside, but our server said that I must be thinking of their Dragon Roll. I highly doubt it because the Dragon Roll isn't even on the menu. In any case, this roll was also quite disappointing and definitely not worth the hefty $16 price. The roll had a tiny piece of unagi inside, which was cold rather than hot and freshly cooked. All in all, quite disappointing and sad that the quality of this once 5 star place has declined to the point that I can't rate it higher than 3 stars.

Review Text :
Terrible! My first and last visit here ever. Let's start with the fact that it was my friend's birthday. It was my husband and me, my bff and her husband. Our main plan for the evening was to head to Sing-Sing. Due to getting a late start, we decided to stop here for dinner. It was Saturday night after 8pm so not very busy. We were seated outside quickly. Then we waited. And waited. A waitress passed our table 4 or 5 times without a word.After at least five minutes, the hostess came outside and said that our waiter would be with us shortly, but she could get our drinks. It took her several minutes to bring out all of the drinks, since she didn't bring them all out together. And I still had to ask for my drink, because she forgot. There is some type of "birthday special" which inclues $15 off of a dinner, free cake, and some type of "sparker" and "popper" celebration. And a free gift...."while supplies last", whatever that means. This is good one week prior or after your actual birthday....pending valid ID. Although the menu also says not valid on Saturdays or holidays, my friend inquires anyways, since it is not at all busy. The hostess says that they will honor the birthday special and that the manager "is really cool and will be fine with it". Fine. Waiter Joe finally arrives....dude is clueless. My friend's husband and I get hibachi dinners and my husband and friend get sushi platters. He asks what type of salad dressing we want....ginger or vinegar and oil. All four of us say vinegar and oil, all four come out with ginger. We have to ask the waiter several times for obvious things - Silverware and Napkins, More Drinks, To Take Plates Off Of The Table. You know, things that should come as common knowledge to wait staff.When our meals come, he brings out one plate of sushi and seems confused, stating that they put all of the sushi on one plate.....uh no. We tell him there should be two plates. I mean, two people ordered two separate meals?! He fixes it and returns. Has no idea whose order goes to who....ugh. At the end of the meal, Joe messes up our checks, putting things my friends ordered on our check. Again, we have to wait for this to get fixed. The worst part is that they automatically put 20% gratuity on the bill. I would not have left this dude a dollar if I had the choice. We waited several minutes to get our change. I actually had to go up to the bar and ask a bartender to find my waiter. Joe obviously cannot count either, he gave us $1.50 too much in change. I figured it could come out of his tip....Here's the kicker....my friend gets none of this "birthday special"...no free cake, no $15 off, nothing. We inquire with Joe, who is still clueless. He has the manager, Jay, come out. My friend explains that, yes, we understand that it is Saturday, however the hostess said that it would be fine. Jay blabbers something about it being Saturday, and they try to exclude Saturdays to drum up business other, less busy days. We state, they are not busy at the moment. And this free cake thing means apparently, according to the manager, that if you bring your own cake, they won't charge you to plate it. His explanation for the ambiguous script on the menu? "The Japanese can't explain things well". Oh, okay. He also says that the birthday special requires four meals to be purchased. Well, there is four of us, we say. He says, no....since they were on separate checks. Jay also says that this is "up the manager's discretion", but still will not give her the discount.My friend says, "Okay that's fine. We just won't be returning". the manager's response is...."Have a nice night" and Walks Away! I cannot even comment on the food....which was fine - not great not terrible - because there were so many other things to distract from the experience. This should have been a nice relaxing dinner with friends and it was blah blah blah. I won't speak for the others (although I know their thoughts), but I feel cheated. One of the worst experiences at a restaurant ever. Will. Never. Ever. Ever. Return. You suck Yokoso!I've eaten here a few times, usually for chicken and shrimp teriyaki off the hibachi but this particular Tuesday I came on a solo mission for half off specialty sushi and I've never been more pleased.I started with the Spider Roll, a combination of of course rice and a seaweed wrap that has soft shell crab tempura, avocado, crab and cucumber add in a little wasabi sauce and eel sauce and you got yourself a combination you never want to stop coming.  So much so I was gonna venture off but stayed with this for 3 orders.  15 pieces of sushi and $20 later I couldn't be any happier.  The rolls came quick,the bartender served them with a smile and the price well, the price was worth every hard earned cent.  For the health conscious keep in mind what I ate was a total of 1000 calories and it surely will keep me full long through the evening.  The drinks are a little expensive but that's the price you pay for convenience at any restaurant.  They are always generously made and the beer is always cold.  The staff always welcomes me with open arms and throws in any extras you may need without a grunt like pickled ginger, wasabi, lemons and sauces.  I've been here before and now that I know about this day of the week I'll be coming back a bit more often but next time, with lots of people!

Review Text :
Joe's is on the South side of Bethany and a little West of 19th Ave, in a strip mall sort of. They have a large sign out front.Daaauumm good food. I had the cod, nice big flaky hunk-o-fish. A little over cooked but not too bad.The Shrimp, good size great crisp, good flavor. The beef rib, spicy (not spicy, just more flavor) Huge rib perfectly cooked and seasoned/sauced.Mac N Cheese, just like mamma use to make with welfare cheese! I had a chance to talk to Joe and his lovely wife, nice real people!Joe was kind enough to "lend" me a container of peach cobbler. I say lend because I WILL BE BACK FOR MORE. The burgers did not look like anything to write home about. Go for the fish N que.Some of the Best tasting Catfish that I've eaten out here in PHX. Reminds of what I used to get back home in East Texas. Turns out that most of Papa Joe's family are from Texas and they brought back those great tasting flavors to AZ. Nice!Love their simple menu of tasty treats. Catfish, Cod, and Whiting are all available in both regular or spicy. They have Shrimp, Hot Wings, Chicken Strips, BBQ Brisket, BBQ Pork, Ribs, Hot Links as well as Burgers and then some. The choices of sides are also a bonus and include items like Collard Greens, fried Okra, Potato Salad, Cole Slaw, Jalapeno Hush Puppies, Mac & Cheese, Onion Rings, Sweet Potato Tater Tots, Beans ... too many to list them all.Normally get the 3 pc Spicy Catfish with 4 Shrimp and a side of whatever with a giant Grape Drink. Boy that brings back the memories. My wife usually gets the Cod and Shrimp Basket with a side. I have not tried the BBQ yet but definitely have it on my radar for next time.Papa Joe and his crew are extremely friendly and most helpful. Everything is very good and you can tell they put a lot of Love and Soul into their food. Don't forget a little Granny Ann's Sweet Potato Pie, Peach Cobbler, Cheese Cake, or Pecan Pie to finish off your meal.Give Papa Joe a shout out and you will be pleased. Located in a small strip shop on the south side of Bethany and not in the hospital across street like the Yelp map suggest. TOUCHDOWN!5 STARSToday is National Catfish Day, so I thought of having a fried catfish meal at Papa Joe's. I definitely was not disappointed. I ordered the one-piece catfish combo; this included a humongous fillet of catfish. Good thing I decided to order only one piece; two would have been too much for me, even though an additional filet would not have cost much more. The combo also included some fried shrimp, a side (I chose potato salad), and a drink (iced tea for me). The catfish was really good - the fillet was tender, hot, and  juicy and was covered with a light, crunchy batter. They gave me 3 fried shrimp instead of the 2 that was supposed to come with the combo - I'm not complaining about that ;) and the potato salad was quite good. Everything - including the drink - for $6.05 plus tax. It's rare to come across a place that serves food this good and tasty for so little money.

Review Text :
Took the fam out for barbecue at Dickey's the other night and I must say it was really GOOD.  We ordered the family meal which was plenty for the four of us. I haven't had brisket this good since I lived in West Texas. We'll be going back!Grand Opening!!!Located at the Las Vegas Outlet Center right between Buffalo Wild Wings & Dunkin Donuts this place has finally opened. Yah!!!!I had been waiting for this place to open ever since I recieved their email newsletter telling me about this NEW Vegas location.I knew from checking out their website that it wasn't "smoked" bbq-they give instructions on how to bake them low & slow.So I had low expectations but it's BBQ it's NEW and that's really all it takes to get me in the door.The place was fairly busy with quite a large staff prepared to handle any rush. The mgmt was busy cleaning,greeting and making sure everyone was satisfied. Very friendly people.-The manager told me the lunch crowd was out the door & around the corner!!I was already starving having just got off of work so I went big and ordered a 3 meat plate with 2 sides & a roll. I got the beef brisket,pulled pork & pork ribs-$12 plus a Big Yellow Cup $2.The place smelled great so I was hoping the bbq would be as good and I was not at all disappointed.The meats were very tender & moist, fall-off the bone ribs and the sauce was sweet but had a little something to it I can't describe but it was pretty good. Kinda Caroilna-style.The baked potato casserole was an unusual yet delightful side and the mac n cheese was really mini shells & cheese and was nothing special it was NOT baked and kinda plain.Everyone in the place seemed to be enjoying themselves and the FREE ice cream was quite a hit, the BBQ was better than average, the sides ok, but the rolls were fantastic & it was super-FAST!They pride themselves on being a fast-food bbq stand. So for fast-food it totally rocks, for Vegas BBQ its better than average for a chain-store BBQ.Bring your kids in on Sundays to eat for FREE(12 & under)!!FREE ice cream all the time.Check it out!http://www.dickeys.com/bbq-cravin.aspxAnother Grand Opening!!I got an email saying they were giving awayy a 32" TV & $2.99 BBQ Sandwiches, so I bit.It was from 12-2 so I waited until 1:30 and the place was I packed after I ordered I had to wait for a seat to open up to be able to dine-in.I ordered 2 sandwiches To Go-Pork & Brisket.I also ordered a 3 meat platter-Pork Ribs(2),Beef Brisket & Pulled Pork plus 2 sides and a roll. I ordered mac n cheese & potato salad.The food came out fast & the staff was very attentive BUT....Disappoitning to say the least. The meat was cold, the food was altogether bland and mushy.The ribs were ok but bot good enough to justify $22!!This place is pricy and NOT my kind of BBQ. I like it with a little crunch and a little smoke flavor if they are claim claim to smoke it. BBQ sauce is sweet,watery and warmI will NOT be back.The Husband is all about some good barbecue and first heard of Dickeys during a recent visit to Reno.  When I mentioned that there was a location in Vegas, he was all over it.One of the bigger pluses on our visit was that I had an Entertainment Book coupon for BOGO free!  Score!We both decided on the 2 Meat Plate to maximize on the coupon and the variety of food to try.* The 2 Meat Plate ($10): Signature Chopped Beef Brisket and Sliced Beef Brisket, Waffle Iron Fries, Mac N Cheese - Although it's their signature chopped brisket, the Husband preferred the sliced one more.  The waffle iron fries could be seasoned too.  The mac n cheese was very creamy though.* The 2 Meat Plate ($10): Spicy Hot Links and Fall Off the Bone Pork Ribs, Fried Onion Tanglers, Baked Potato Casserole - The spicy hot links weren't all that spicy or impressive, sadly enough.  And the pork ribs were just okay.  We were expecting something different from the baked potato casserole when all it ended up being was mashed potatoes with some fixings.  The onion tanglers were just limp onion rings and were only okay as well.Both orders came with a bread roll and you can help yourself to dill pickle slices and barbecue sauce.They also offer Sweet Tea in their signature plastic yellow cups that you can take home.Ultimately, it sounded like a lot more food but in reality, it wasn't all that much.  Overall, it was just an okay experience with only okay food.  On the particular day we went, there was a line going out the door because of a promotion they were offering.  Other than that, we probably won't be back.  It just didn't live up to the barbecue hype we were expecting.

Review Text :
DO NOT even attempt to go here for lunch during the week between 11:30-1:00. There are Xavier kids EVERYWHERE. You know what, just stay off Camelback all together. You've been warned.I've heard of the Magic Mushroom joint, but this came at me out of left field.  I decided to hit this shack with a work bud of mine (Groovy P.) to check it out.  The first thing I noticed (other than the wonderfully tacky decor) was the decent prices.  Tacos are $1.50 each (tax included).  I went with the Burro.  Honestly If they would have named the place Two Hippies and a Burro, I would have enjoyed myself more.  But Beachhouse is fine too, I guess.The guy taking orders is the owner himself.  He owns the Magic Mushroom place down on Indian School too.  I think its refreshing to have the owner taking orders.  Owners know how to do it right!  He asked me my first name and scribbled it onto a brown bag. NOW I'm diggin this place!  He was calling regulars up with nicknames like Snowman Steve, and Sarge.  I wanna be a regular to find out what awesome alter-persona he labels me.  Knowing my luck, he'd name me Conehead Chris or Corporate Chris or something else I wouldn't like. I wanna be Snowball Steve!The wait was long. 25 minutes long! Standing around staring at other people waiting. *Check watch* shuffle feet *Check watch*... Then I hear "CHRIS!!! PATIO PICKUP!"  Wtf?!?! Wheres the patio?So I get my food and scarf it down.  Carne Asada... not spiced for a typical burrito... Cabbage??? To say the least, it was pretty damn good.  For $4, you can't go wrong!  Next time I'll just get 2 tacos...I'll be back, Mr. Hippy...If you have a longish lunch hour, go.  I went around 5pm tonight and there was nobody in front of me.  Took me 5 minutes to get my fish burrito (Thanks to Chris T for the recommendation!)It was HUGE and came with a little cup of two salsas: green and red.  I cut it in half to enjoy the salsas separately.  Filled to the brim with rice, cheese, beans and the fish and smothered in some sort of sauce, it was delicious!  Service was super-friendly and everyone had a smile on their face and said "Amy, your fish burrito is ready!"  I mean, the personalized service was great.  Maybe hitting them at a slow hour was what did it.  There is a little retail spot where you can get incense (they're hippies, get it???) and posters on the wall to peruse while waiting.  I took mine home, but the patio is lovely.  There's even a vintage bike parked out front with little baskets filled with potted plants.  How adorable is that????Besides being a good taco/burrito/lemonade stand, THBH is imo the coolest club house on the block. It's chock-full of knickknacks, posters, and snarky signage that will keep you occupied while waiting for your order. I wasn't even bothered by the lingering smell of lavender incense, plenty of which to select from. I purchased opium and cherry. Nope, never gonna burn em; impulse buy. The side patio is a great spot to sit and munch on 2 dollar tacos while being windblown by industrial coolers and misting systems. I love it. Tonight's attraction, Poetry Slam, and man this was one slam jam. Note to self, take up ripping people to shreds by way of organized angry verbal release. Possible new found therapy. My mental first draft in play as a sit sipping on a paper parasol topped watermelon lemonade. In sum, I find one word that describes this jaunt, E-CLECTIC! Beats the heck out of drive-thru any day.Ok. So I've never actually been to Two Hippies BHOTAB...but I'm going to review it anyway. JUST KIDDING! I've had take out but someone else has always picked it up for me. You know. I have people for that. First off I must say for bong sake you have the longest restaurant name evah! Secondly I must say your pork tacos really hit the spot. Granted one side of the tortilla becomes a bit slimy by the time it reaches me (from my people) and the foil is unwrapped (again, my people) and I finally plunge that delicious hippie taco into my boca. The pork is moist (ewww, i don't usually say moist...OMG...I said it twice) and a little crunchy in parts. Perfection. Seasoned with love. Like a good hippie. A few beans, cabbage, cheese and tomatoes thrown in and I'm happier than a hippie at a Patchouli sale. Or happier than a hippie in a muraled van selling incense and bongs on Venice Beach. Or happier than....oh...you get the idea. All this love for under $2 a taco. Now I know why you are Outgrageous! I may tye dye a t shirt, get out the Nag Champa and pop in Dazed and Confused. Now. Damnit. Where is that bag of Doritos?Now we stand at a crossroads; perhaps a dilemma. Is it truly Mexican when it's not made by Mexicans? Is a taco a taco just because someone said it is? Or a burrito? The philosophies and debates of Mexican food can go on for hours. But I like to think of it like this: If it tastes good, who cares?This is the case with Two Hippies Beach House. Opened by the same Two Hippies, Andy and Jan Goldstein, who brought us Two Hippies Magic Mushroom Burger, they use words like tacos and burritos but never actually say they serve Mexican food.What they do serve is an accessible, mostly delicious, well-priced menu. Really, any three tacos are $5, anytime!If you've ever been to some of the surf shacks in San Diego, you'll notice it's like they picked one up and dropped it on the corner of Camelback Road and 5th Street â€" sans the sand of course.In true Two Hippies fashion, every square inch of this small establishment is absolutely covered with kitsch of all kinds; such blissful tackiness. The front is about the size of a postage stamp, barely enough room to stand after ordering at the counter. Once your order is ready, they call out your name. You can take your stash home or go around back and pull up a picnic table.While you wait, take in all the decorations, though if you have some condition of OCD, you might have a problem with the clutter and want to start arranging and organizing. I had to put my hands under my seat so as not to give in to my secret urges.The emphasis on the menu is tacos, as well as the hot dogs and lemonades. Two Hippies also can make any of the taco flavors into a burrito like the Red Beef ($5). The burritos are massive. If I had to guess, Iâ€™d say they probably are close to a pound. They are loaded with tender red chile beef, rice and beans, and they fill you up big time.The Cheese Crisp with Chicken ($4.50) is also huge and fully packed with tender chicken, onion, guacamole, tomato and cabbage. Itâ€™s much lighter than the burrito but still very filling.On another other visit I stuck with the tacos, ordering up the Taco 3 Pack ($5) and choosing fish, cactus and chicken. These tacos are massive, like all the food at Two Hippies. Youâ€™ll never leave hungry.Interestingly, Two Hippies does not use corn tortillas, opting instead for the medium sized flour variety.I'm always leery about ordering fish since we live hundreds of miles from the closest ocean, and on one visit my instincts were spot on. The fish was so strong I could only manage a few bites, even with the delicious red salsa it couldn't help that poor fish.Although another visit revealed the fish to be spot on, flaky and mild, so the fish taco could be a crap shoot. The chicken taco was a chicken taco, good with a nice balance of veggies and meat. However my favorite was the cactus taco, tender sliced cactus topped with cabbage, onion, tomato, rice, beans and cilantro. The cactus had a delicate sweet flavor and with so many textures was a delight to chow.Beach House also serves up several different topped all beef hot dogs. I had the pleasure of trying the No. 6 ($3.75), which is pretty much the kitchen sink model. A soft squishy bun covered with pinto beans, cheese, jalapeos, mustard, ketchup, mayo and guacamole. Whew, this is like the daddy of all hot dogs. I think this could have been even a plain dog and I would have loved it.I'm not sure where they get their hot dogs, but the meat in this one was just so tasty, the toppings only added to my pleasure.There are eight other hot dogs that also piqued my interest like the No. 4 ($4) that has feta, pesto-mayo, bacon, tomato and onion and the No. 8 ($3.75), which is covered simply in guacamole. I had forgotten how much I enjoy a good hot dog, look out Costco!With 16 base flavors, the lemonades ($3) are a great way to to complete your meal. They use shaved ice so it's almost like having a slushy â€" complete with a brain freeze if you don't take your time. You can also combine different flavors to come up with your own custom lemonade flavor. The fun part is trying your different creations. Cherry and raspberry were nice and tart, but one combo was even better, the strawberry and peach. For me this almost had a creaminess from the round flavor of the peaches, this could be my signature drink on any upcoming visits if there weren't so many other choices.Two Hippies Beach House does a pretty good job of bringing the walk-up taco shack to Central Phoenix, and it certainly entices all sorts of people. So if you decide to check this place out and you see a big bear stuffing his face with a yummy hot dog or one of the cactus tacos, please feel free to say hi.I was out running a couple of errands last week and a friend called and suggested lunch at Two Outraged Hippies Taco's and Beach something:)I hadn't been to a Two Hippies for a couple of years...I think it was their burger joint...that one didn't make much of an impression on me either way :-IBut I thought to myself...well, I like lunch:)And, I like taco's:)And I was a hippie of the first water back in my day (which, BTW, means that it's no longer "My Day", sadly:(But I'm not thrilled by Two Hippies taco's:(I got dos taco's...a chicken and a carne asada, along with a can of soda pop...the people taking my $5.00 cash were very nice (and they were trying to dress up like hippies or something, too!...too adorable for words:)I didn't get fish taco's...experience (the kind gained through trial and many, many errors)...has taught me that the only place that I really like to get fish tacos, is from one of the beach palapa's in Bahia de Navidad...where the panga's pull right up on the sand...the fishermen jump out and hand the cook in the palapa a red snapper or dorado or something else with fins...they clean it, cut it up, grill it, throw some lettuce and homemade salsa on it and it's a taco about 30 minutes after it quit swimming:)Those are pretty good fish taco's...esp. washed down with a cerveza or three:)...I don't remember the name of the place...probably "taco de playa" or something...just walk down the beach...you can't miss it:)10 pesos each for the taco's, 25 pesos a pop for the cerveza...it's a very good deal:)...BTW, that doesn't include round-trip first class airfare or the Governors Suite at the Grand Bay:)No beach at 5th and Camelback:(But, I digress:)I liked the service and the price (and I really appreciate the staff trying to look like hippies for me...really...a blast from past:)I really didn't care for the food, itself...outrageous has a number of different connotations, depending on context...but I didn't find the taco's "outrageous" in any sense of the word:)Although nowhere near as bad as Skip & Jan's attempt at taco's, the hippies taco's leave more than a bit to be desired...the carne asada was dry, stringy, bland, and the salsa they give you in the little plastic cups didn't really improve things.So I tried the chicken taco and found it to be dry, stringy, bland, and the salsa they gave...!Hey wait a minute...did they just give me two of the same thing and try to call them something different?!?!?...That would be so like the hippies I knew back in the `60's and `70's:-)...always stoned, never quite sure what they were doing...so much fun to watch:)But no, they gave me carne asada and chicken...the taco's just looked and tasted very much alike (the chicken was somewhat whiter, but other than that...not much difference:(In Phoenix, a city with so many options for getting my taco fix, even the nostalgia for times long gone (and thankfully so...can you imagine a world in which all we want to do is sit around all day, get high, and make love...not war...where would we all be? :-) can't make up for these lackluster offerings:(There are tons of better taco shop's...many of which don't even require the plane ride and hotel stay:)I was lucky enough to meet up here with Christina P for lunch yesterday.  The menu is currently the same as the other beach house with soft tacos, burritos and hot dogs.  They are are planning to add tamales to the regular menu and we got to try a sample of pork tamale and it was tasty.I got the three tacos for $5 and a lemonade for $3.  There are several flavors of lemonade but I got the plain.  I got one each of fish, carne asada and chicken.  They were all tasty and I tried some of both the green and red sauces on them.  One thing I noticed is the meat didn't stand out on any of them and there was very little taste difference between the three.  All the ingredients were fresh and there was nothing soggy.  I thought the lemonade was good.They have only been open a week and of course the place is spotless.  The two employees we dealt with were very pleasant.  I always carry cash which is a good thing because that is all they take.  There is an ATM in the lobby.  I haven't been to their other location but I am told it is much smaller. Inside there were 5 2tops and some stools with a couple of tables outside too.  The tables would seat 3 or 4 (cramped) so I think they should have a couple of additional chairs.Overall I see it as a good neighborhood place to grab a quick bite to eat but certainly not a destinationSeeing the word "hippies" in the restaurant name had me stoked, as them tree-huggin hippie types got to have some vegetarian food, right? Yep.I walked up to the lil window and asked about the veggie options, the guy behind the counter informed me that they have a cactus burrito and that it was one of his favorites. Score! Or so I thought...Upon receiving the large, heavily stuffed burrito, I bit in with high hopes. Those hopes quickly dissipated as I found that the innards of the burrito were primarly COLD. The cactus pieces were cold, the cheese wasn't melted at all. The only thing that had a bit of warmth were the beans, which weren't even hot, they were luke warm.Sorry guys, but a cold burrito isn't going to cut it. Make that cactus, beans and rice HOT in your burritos if you want some customers. Melt the friggin cheese in there, don't leave it ice cold.I was out running errands when I got hungry and decided to take a shot on Two Hippies Beach House. I pulled in and almost hit a crack head who walked in front of my car with two Phoenix Police Officers as witnesses to this mishap. After waiting for said crack head to skitter away, I got out of my car and approached the line. One of the officers said to me "Good brakes!" Whew! For my lunch, I decided on a fish burro sans cilantro and a peach lemonade. I was thankful for the cash I had in my wallet as they do not accept plastic of any form. I only had to wait for about 5 minutes for my food to be done and I was on my way home. I unwrapped my burro and took a huge bite. Hmm... nothing too amazing, just ok. First off. I DISLIKE when restaurants don't warm the tortilla that they make burros with and yes, this Blatina can tell the difference. Second, the burro was FULL of cabbage and not a lot of fish. The salsa was good and flavorful so I used a lot of it to flavor the burro and it brought some good spice to the burro. Overall it was just ok. Nothing amazing and nothing I would crave. The real winner was the peach lemonade that comes in slushy form. Yum! I would visit Two Hippies again to try their other offerings. The price is good, and the food is ok.Three taco's for $6, and that's the every day price. ;-)I've had Two Hippies Beach House about three times now and there's just something about them that doesn't quite sit right. I want to love them for the $6 / three tacos meal, but my GI system seems to say otherwise. I've had different combinations of tacos here with varying success, and since I'm no masochistic I must gracefully withdraw my name from ballot for "Duke of the Beach House." - no write in's, please.Maybe it's the enourmose portions per taco, or perhaps the combination of spices used when cooking the beef. Maybe it was the rice, or extra sliced jalepenos I always ask for. Either way, the food had a good taste, and a great price, but just doesn't agree with my sensitive 'personality'; I guess. :-/Alas, I live to fight the good (food) fight in this ever lasting battle.Happy Yelping Phoenix.

Review Text :
Cheap eats @LasVegasHilton Great sandwiches,hotdogs and breakfast.Reasonably priced and made to order.WARNING: the hamburgers are NOT SO GOOD!!BUT...Deli sandwiches are some of the BEST anywhere!!Stopped in here for lunch to grab a quick bite before a college football game on Saturday.  I've been here many times.  On this last visit, I ordered a 6" Italian Sub.You order the Sandwich from the cashier and you receive a number, then a server brings out the order to your table.  Very convenient.  Since it's located next to the SuperBook, there are plenty of Plasma TVs with sporting events and horse racing to keep you distracted while you wait for your food.  There's also a ton of seating, so you'll be sure to find a place to sit unlike many of the sportsbook delis in Vegas.After a short wait our food was ready.  The Meat & toppings were fresh.  This Deli advertises that they use Boar's Head Deli Meats, so that's always a plus....I love Boar's Head products.  Although it was only a 6" Sandwich, it was very filling.Overall, great experience & great service.Will I return?  Of course!

Restaurant name  Mix Zone Cafe

Review Text :
We've been hearing the rage about Mix Zone Cafe and finally got a taste of it at the Yelp Elite Event a few months back.  We were highly impressed by their 3 Color Curry then and we wanted more!The Grilled Beef Salad "grilled beef with red onion, tomato and cilantro, seasoned with lime juice and Thai chili" ($7.95) was an easy choice as this is one of the Husband's favorite Thai dishes.  He initially chose "Hot" for their heat level and I reminded him that others have commented on how extra hot their heat was here.  So, he changed it to Medium.  Disappointingly, it was more like a Mild heat.  It was good, but we wanted the heat after all!We also shared their signature dish of 3 Color Curry "A Mix Zone special blend of red, yellow, and green curry and all their vegetables with choice of meat." ($9.95) with tofu.  I also went for Medium too, but did wish it was spicier after we got it.  I also appreciated the mix of veggies in there - string beans, carrots, bamboo shoots, carrots, bell peppers and cucumbers.Another incentive was that they were now offering all day lunch specials and a free brown rice upgrade.  Well, this wasn't the case anymore when we went.  (Although they still had the lunch special signage outside even though it was clearly dinner time.)  Brown rice now costs $.50 more.  And we also discovered they are no longer accepting coupons.  Overall, we enjoyed our meal but left a bit disappointed.  The heat just wasn't there, so I guess it depends on who is working the kitchen when you go.  It's definitely worth checking out when they are running their lunch specials though!3.5 stars.Don't get your heart set on any one dish here, because chances are, they'll be out of it. I have come by more than once when my first choice dish was unavailable. Perhaps they don't stock certain meats because they don't get much business, but I haven't noticed a consistent trend as to which items are out.The fried catfish was just okay- lots of peppers and onions, good amount of basil, but spicier than expected. The three-color curry is hyped as being "only available here!", but the version at Le Thai is a bit better, this one was watery. I keep wanting to try their green curry fried rice, but it has been out twice now- which is baffling, considering they still obviously serve both rice and curry.Heads up, the spice scale is wonky- it's one to four, and a two is hotter than expected. I guess the choice is none or too much? No clue.

Restaurant name  Montreal En Scene
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
En Scene is in the Montreal - Trudeau airport, past the customs of the International concourse, but before you walk toward the gates.Being in Montreal, I was expecting breakfast to be more continental, like in western Europe with toast, danish, thin slices of meats, espresso, some cheese and fruit. But here at En Scene, they served a great North American/English influenced country style breakfast, except with that great French Pan, the large thick slices of French White bread. My order (all figures in $CAD):1 Cafe                      $1.79 1 Jus D'orange      $3.992 Oeufs (Brouille)Roties BlancJambon                   $6.49So a great hot breakfast of 2 eggs, ham and that great thick bread with little servings of peanut  butter and jam (it's Quebec!) for $6.49! Look out Denny's!

Restaurant name  Le Taj
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
"Cuisine indienne" as its called in these parts, was a something I was craving for badly during one of my last trips to Montreal. Already a city filled with so many ethnic options, Taj was literally the closest Indian place near our hotel. There are almost always questions for me before I head out to a new place: Is it local? Who goes there? What are the prices? How is the food? etc. Without consultation of my group due to my affinity for Indian cuisine, I immediately set forth for Le Taj and never looked back. It so happened to be during their lunch buffet hour, which at that time was priced at $12.95. Even before the clock struck noon, the place was crowded enough to warrant a wait for 4. While I waited I noticed how clean and modern the restaurant was. Some gourmet Indian establishments prefer the maharaja palatial look, where as Le Taj was simple, elegant, and sophisticated.The buffet was wonderfully presented. Everything from the serving spoon to the trays they were served in were immaculate. There was a service person on hand to wipe away any immediate spills and adjust items if they were put out of place. I thought the job was a bit tedious and unnecessary initially, but it really does make a difference for how people perceive lunch hour gluttony in buffet form.There was an amazing slew of options, with an adequate veggie to meat ratio along with some stellar desserts and sides. All of this food was presented in an open window where someone in the back was baking fresh naan (to be served table side) and dangling along a skewer was some freshly made tandoori chicken. I couldn't stop eating the fish curry here, it was perfectly flaky, the curry was rich without all the excess oil. I was also a very impressed with their lamb vindaloo, which was a little bit sweet and a lot savory, I went for seconds only moments after gobbling the first go-around. The naan was fluffy and even fragrant; a puffy bit of goodness that was a great complement to the meal. With the exception of rasmalai and burfi, I am not one for desserts, however the mini-grenade sized galub jamuns were as stellar as I've ever had.Service was quick and professional. They were attentive throughout the experience and were awesome all around. They were also armed with individual credit card machines, which made it an easy process to check out and pay without hassle.I've been back several times since and I've been quite satisfied each time. The buffet has since surged to $14.95, but with that the options have also been souped up as well. I've eaten some scrumptious veggie dishes (veggie samosa, fried cauliflower, sag paneer, aloo gobi, eggplant) and some excellent meat curries (goat biriyani, sag murgh, chicken makhani), which have all been delicious enough to give this place my blessing.

As you may know, Vietnam was colonized by the French for many, many long years, so it has a French influence (like in the french bread Vietnamese sandwiches made famous by Lee's Sandwiches, which are franchised everywhere). So here in Montreal, it is only natural to find many Vietnamese restaurants, just like in France. Nhu Y restaurant is known for its Chef, who was trained in French cooking schools in Vietnam. The 2 dishes this restaurant is famous for according to the local Vietnamese diaspora is Canh Chua Ca Bong Lau, or sweet and sour Catfish Soup, which has a great mix of flavors. And the other is their signature appetizer, Chicken Wings, marinated in Nuoc Mam (fish sauce) and crisped up for a great combination of texture and flavor. Tres Delicieux!

So the husband has taken my yelping as a mission to find new and better places recently. Going to the Copper Door was his idea, but I won't hold it against him.On a Sunday night for dinner this place was EMPTY. Well, not completely empty, there was one other couple in the entire restaurant.  The atmosphere is beautiful: wonderful photographs of old Phoenix, a baby grand piano, and the most beautiful ceiling tiles I've ever seen (not that I make a habit out of looking at the ceiling).We both ordered the iced tea, and it was incredibly delicious.  I have a feeling that they add just a shriggle of sugar to cut down on the typical bitter flavor of tea, without making it sweet.As Maria F. states, the menu does claim to have vegan options.  I saw three that were labled vegan, although one contained honey.  I would doubt their understanding of what is vegan food.Then came our meals.  Mine was the artichoke and cheese stuffed ravioli with shrimp, or at least it was supposed to be.  When the waiter brought out my dish, it was just  plate of raviolis.  I thought at first that I misunderstood, and that maybe the shrimp was inside the pasta.  So I tried to cut open the pasta and I had to put muscle into it.  To my dismay, no shrimp.  I told the waiter that I ordered shrimp, he looked confused and said he would be back.  He came back 3-5 minutes later to say that he would take my plate and be back.  About 10 minutes later I get the same dried-out, hard pasta raviolis with 4 shrimp.  The waiter said he put extra on.  Extra what?  The husband's well-done burger was medium at best.  While I was waiting for my food, he said that he had eaten better and larger burgers at Seamus's next door.Luckily, the waiter didn't charge us the full $17 for the man's undercooked meat patty and a side of cottage cheese, just $10.  And he didn't add the $5 to my $17 dish for the shrimp, not even the extra one.  And the hostess saw us at Seamus's afterwards and was dissappointed about our experience.  She was very helpful, nice and gave us a 15% off coupon for lunch which she said was very good and not as pricey.  I might give them another chance, but it won't be at dinnertime.

Review Text :
My roommate and I were starving and needed to go grocery shopping.  I really wanted a sub, but the Jimmy Johns in Bakery Square has the worst delivery area ever.  I had seen Spak Brothers on Yelp and was a bit skeptical of the location.  Thank goodness we braved the cold and Garfield.The Italian hoagie was amazing.  For $8.88, I ended up with three meals out of the hoagie.  The meat was delicious with no fat pieces, and there was the perfect balance and combination of toppings.  I also ordered a slice of cheese pizza for $1.87, and that was delicious as well.  The amount of food you get for the price is amazing.And to top it all off, they have a thousand vegan options?  I can't wait to come back and try the vegan options too!The service was efficent, and there are 2 pinball tables at $.75/game to play while you wait for food.  This is definitley a take-out establishment.Credit cards accepted!I've been wanting to try Spak Brother for awhile now. From co-workers raving about it to the artistic exterior to the building, I wanted to see what the hoopla was all about. I was in Bloomfield for work so I decided to stop by and grab a sandwich. The inside is nothing to brag about. It's not somewhere I'd be comfortable eating inside at, but I don't think they market it that way so I can't really take points off because of that. There are a few places to sit and a pinball table, but nothing substantial. The menu is decent sized. All the basics and nothing too too fancy. I went with the grilled chicken breast hoagie with lettuce, tomato, cheese and ranch dressing. It took about 15-20 minutes to make, but it was well worth the wait! Everything was so fresh and tasty. It practically melted in my mouth. The best part was the ranch dressing. It was so creamy and full of flavor. I am obsessed with homemade ranch sauces and this was one of the best I've ever tasted. The sandwich (half) was $6 including tax and I think it was reasonably priced. Most full sandwiches went between $8-$9. I'm excited to go back and try some more options on the menu! Nothing better than supporting local business, especially those on Penn Avenue during all of this messy construction!I've been wanting to try Spak forever, so when a friend and I wanted to get takeout yesterday night, I decided to finally try it.  Calling ahead at 5:30pm, we were given an estimate of 20 min., which wasn't too bad and worked out perfectly for us, given the location of my apt.  We showed up at 6pm, and our order was ready for us upon arrival, so after paying, we headed back to my place to consume the goods.Our order consisted of a medium (14") pepperoni and ricotta pizza and an order of honey mustard seitan wings ($20 together).  The seitan wings were quite good--the best I've had, though I've only had them at one other place in PGH--and the honey mustard sauce was delicious.  The pizza was delicious--in fact, I'd say it was some of the best pizza I've had in PGH, and I've tried many pizza places to date, as can be seen from my pizza list.  While the crust wasn't perfectly crispy the way I like it, it did have some crispness, and I particularly liked the flavor and consistency of the dough once I bit into it.  The toppings were flavorful and well proportioned, and worked well together, despite my doubts that they might be odd together.  My friend was impressed with the wings and pizza, as well, confirming my impressions.Overall, I'd say that Spak Bros. lived up to its reputation.  A couple of friends of mine who enjoyed Spak and recommended it commented that they don't feel hipster enough when they walk in to pick up their order, and I saw what they mean, since my friend and I definitely looked square compared to all of the employees and other customers.  Even if you're as un-hipster as us, I'd recommend stopping by, since Spak undoubtedly has some of the best pizza in PGH.

See what happens when you wait too long to write your review!? Phoenix Magazine beats you to the punch and lists one of your favorite finds as one of the Valley's best dishes! Oh well, I guess I should just feel "validated."Here's my take on this place:For $12.50 you get a platter full of diced shrimp ceviche bordered by at least a dozen grilled regular sized shrimp and no less that a whole avocado's worth of wedges. It's served with crisp, flat, tostada chips and is plenty to share! A real value!!If I'm dining alone, I generally get a couple of pupusas. Pupusas are like thick corn tortillas stuffed with cheese, beans or meat - your pick! They even offer a version stuffed with the loroco flower, which I understand is similar to a squash blossom. Myself? I'm a bean and cheese girl most of the time. And, I prefer them straight up: skip the tomato sauce and slaw topping. The chicken soup is flavorful and the portion size is significant, served with a couple of handmade tortillas.Salvadoreno recently got a beer and wine license, and, a I can't think of a better beverage to wash down a pupusa than an ice cold beer!Oh! I guess this can be my "scoop" - Salvadoreno is going to start offering a $7.95 lunch buffet from 11 - 3. Buffet items will vary depending on the day of the week.  I'm feelin' a pupusa eating contest as a lunchtime UYE!What a delightful break from the norm. Papusas are the main attraction here, and they do them so well. I had the pork and one with loroco flower--both were wonderful. This was the second time I've had papusas (the first being at a papusa festival last year) and they were just as great as I remember them. We started off with the shrimp salad which included grilled shrimp on cucumber slices, topped with avocado and surrounding a bed of mini-shrimp. Served on tostada or just on a fork, it was lovely. I'll definitely be coming back here when I'm jonesing for papusas. Note: A cursory understanding of Spanish is helpful, as our server spoke limited English.So, I finally had a pupusa!  I was at Art Walk in the 'Slope tonight and arrived starving.  I knew I was going to come here for a pupusa.The food is cheap!  I got a bean and cheese pupusa and a bean tamale and spent I think $6.  My tamale wasn't quite heated up.  It wasn't fridge-cold, but nearly.  The pupusa was really rich and loaded with filling.  I was really full by the time I finished my meal.I'll be back again because Dottsy got a shrimp one and I had a bite and it was yummy!  It was nice talking to the owner.  They're from El Salvador and I spent time in Central America going to college.  It was nice hearing the Central American accent, since I'm surrounded by the Mexican dialect here.  Made me miss the warm sandy beaches of Costa Rica.So after tasting this place at the Yelp Science Center party I KNEW I had to go check this place out! I had never even heard of a Pupusas until that fateful Yelp night. The hubs and I rolled in about 7:30ish. We were the only ones in the place aside from the waiter and the cook. We took a seat and the waiter came on over with menus in hand. He was really helpful, I told him I didn't know what I had at the yelp party but I wanted it again. I had the shredded beef, bean and cheese pupusas. So tasty. The hubs and I also split an order of the potato and cheese puff things. It was like a deep fried mashed potato missile! So crunchy on the out side yet so fluffy on the inside. Hubs got 3 pupusas, two shrimp and a steak. I sampled the steak and it was pretty bomb! He went nuts over the shrimp, but I skipped trying it out, wasn't in the shrimp frame of mind. The one thing I wasn't a total fan of was the coleslaw, it has a very vinegary, dill, I don't know what kind of taste. I am VERY finicky with my coleslaw though, hubs said he liked it. The restaurant itself is nothing to write home about. Its olllllld. The tables and chairs are from the late 80's and worn. There was some rad gangsta rap playing over the speakers and Bones reruns on the tv, but when I noticed the time and asked if they could switch the tv to american idol (yes I am a nerd) He gladly did so and turned down the rap. Pretty rad. So for an iced tea, a total of four pupusas and some tasty deep fried potato puff guys, the bill was only $13.99 (with the coupon they gave out at the yelp event). We left very full.Hey! They've got vegan bean pupusas! What's a pupusa? A breaded pocket, kinda like a really really thick doughy tortilla, with a filling inside. The 2 papusa combo comes with rice (made with no animal products), a little cup of beans, salsa and a spicy coleslaw that is delish.Their menu says "ask about our vegan & vegetarian options", but when I told our server we were vegan, she suggested a bunch of cheese items, so apparently she didn't know what vegan means, but I explained.Even so, it's nice that they have options for those of the vegan persuasion. I am bummed that they only have ONE papusa option for us and that is beans. There are a few other veggie+cheese types, but they told us that the fillings are premade and they can't remove the cheese, so that's lame. We also asked if they could make us a potato papusa and they said no.Wish they would offer a few more vegan options, especially some additional vegan pupusa types!You know how some people say that those little mom & pops "hole-in-the-wall" restaurants make the best food? Well, this is THAT place. Seriously, words can't express how much I love pupusas, and choices are limited here in Phoenix, but this place does it right. For those of you who have never had one, it's like a thick homeade tortilla stuffed with cheese and pork- or whatever you choose as the filling, then topped with this pickled cabbage/onion/carrot mixture. Amazing. Pupusas are only around 2 bucks each, and you only need 2 or 3 to fill you up. Come check this place out- I know I'll be back soon.Pupusa. Say that word 5 times fast. Then go get one from Salvadoreno! I am a big fan of Salvadoreno. Especially when it comes to their pupusas. Pupusas are cornmeal patties filled with meat and/or cheese, veggies, or even cactus flower. They are super delicious and filling to say the least. I have had Salvadoreno create "mini pupusas" for several parties that I have hosted and they have been a HIT with my friends. I know a lot of my friends are now pupusa fans because of Salvadoreno! Try a pupusa with a side of crema...yes, it will change your life!I have had a meal at their restaurant a few times as well and have not been disappointed once. The restaurant is more of a "quick meal" or cafe type of setting rather than a nice sit-down restaurant. I will keep this review nice and short because how else can you say how delicious something is?  I look forward to more pupusas in my life!

A wee dram?  Oh h e double l no.  After three flights, four airports, 12 time zones and 22  hours of travel; three fingers please!Listed as one of 55 recommended restaurants in the Michelin Guide for Edinburgh, this one was admittedly chosen for their selection of whiskey.  Of course the food is good.For starters, the first taste of cold smoked Scottish salmon.  Incredibly rich, fatty, very smooth mouth feel.  The intense razor sharp flavor of salmon, unmistakable.  The game terrine, outstanding.  Course ground bits of this and that with a light livery flavor and anise overtones.  Great texture unfortunately, the traditional oatcakes; lets just say horse biscuits are not for me.For mains, a dish known as Crofters Chicken (oven baked chicken breast stuffed with hagggis served with a whisky sauce, sauteed cabbage and root veg).  A brilliant way to introduce haggis to the uninitiated.  The mineral, livery flavor of the offal is mellowed by the chickeny, poultry flavor.  The jus from the chicken moistens the haggis.  The whisky sauce adding a velvity, rich, concentrated whisky flavor to the dish.  Good eats.Very good selection of whisky (nearly 100), many offered in flights for tasting.  All flights come complete with the requisite water and chocolates.  Do not be that guy who asks for ice.  They will frown at that faux pas as it will cloud the whisky and ruin it.Friendly service.  Very reasonably priced.  Mains average £12.A charming, fairly priced pub with great whisky and food.  A fitting welcome to Edinburgh.

I've wanted to visit this place ever since I  saw Anthony Bourdain travel & food show Montreal episode. I must say I was a  bit skeptical at first on whether it is as good as it looks on TV, but my love for pork knuckles overcame any doubts I've had.This place is full of simplicity and old traditions, it's a pub with a local diner atmosphere and an outside terrace. It's perfect for a quick bite to eat and to have some delicious food and drinks with your friends. It's very local, most of the regular customers are older gentlemen and some couples, but then again it was on weekday afternoon, so it's possible the crowd is different during the weekends.Nevertheless, I fell in love with the place. The service was impeccable and quick, the atmosphere was warm, full of smiles and jokes and recommendations from other customers and regulars. The pork knuckle was simply delightful! I love hearty simple foods and this place was more than perfect for "no occasion late lunch". I'd definitely recommend this place to anyone looking to meet with friends, have some 'home-style hearty food' which can be heavy on a stomach (if you eat as much as I did) but easy on your wallet (the bill was also a pleasant surprise).

Beautiful, everything is simply beautiful here! The food, the guests, the music, the decor, the staff and the list goes on. Whether you are local or from out of town, you have to stop by for a little bit of sunlight in your life!A few saturdays ago I finally decided to step into this institution that I've heard so much about and always wanted to try. After a short wait, the host promptly found a seat for me. While perusing the very sober breakfast menu, I was going to select a  healthy choice until Corinne, the friendly server, urged me to try the spicy poached eggs panini and promised that I would not regret it. And am I glad I listened to her... not that I have anything against a good dose of homemade granola with yogourt and fruit salad, but who could refuse a piping hot & crispy on the outside and soft on the inside panini, rich tasting eggs, dressed with siracha, herbs, melted Comté cheese, tasty speck "pork", and roasted tomatoes? Paired with a creamy Latte and sweet chocolate banana brioche, I was ready to start the day.O+G has been on my "must try" list forever and I'm glad I finally did. Open since 1998 the owners have reinvented the business; evolving it from artisan bakery to a full blown restaurant which now specializes in breakfast, paninis and viennoiseries! Everything is freshly made on premise including from the bread used for the sandwiches. The success of this place most probably lies with the fact that the staff is proud of the product they serve, are attentive to your needs, and are just generally cheery - even on a -19C morning. Marie-Helene, Corinne, and Elise thank you for adding a smile to my day!If you dream of spending a weekend morning down in old montreal, imbued in a gentle hustle and bustle atmosphere with soft jazz vocals playing in the background while you enjoy reading your favorite newspaper (or article on your tablet) or mingle with the locals and visitors, then this is the place for you!Masters of texture and spice, especially along the salty/crunchy/spicy taste nexus.The #5 (chevre) sandwich with grilled onions and homemade ketchup was fabulous and the #6 (pork, asparagus, cheese) was even better, blasts of flavor in every bite.Perpetually crowded so it's easiest to get takeout.Come early because they seem to run out of stuff quickly.One word. Actually a few words. The Cuban. That is the only thing I have there and I have been eating there for 7 years.Every time I set foot in here for breakfast (or lunch), I'm always pleased with the food quality, the excellent & friend service and the eclectic and welcoming decor!You'll often hear patrons of Olive & Gourmand complimenting them on the "concept"... interesting because when you ask veteran Marie-Helene and Sandra, or "old crusts" as they jokingly call themselves, there is no concept. It's just the result  of a slow evolution of bringing goodness and joy to people, season after season.The hustle and bustle can perhaps turn off some people who prefer quietness when sipping their café but if you're like me and love the vibe, the energy, the possibility of striking serendipitous conversations with locals or out-of-towners, and the soothing humming of the hustle & bustle this iconic place delivers then you're in for happy times!

Solid, convenient market. Lots of selection, reasonable prices.Stopped in to grab breakfast. Lo and behold were a selection of banh mi. I spotted two bins marked identically (Vietnamese pork sandwiches), except one had "spy" written. No clue what that meant, so I grabbed one (I wouldn't last long on Survivor), and an Aloe drink (decided against beer). Paid about C$4, in cash.The drink was good, and the sandwich was fine for what it was, where it was. The sheen on the sandwich freaked me out when I first unwrapped it, but it ended up being satisfying overall, with pickles, cold cuts, and jalapenos.

Nur mittags wird ein asiatisches Buffet zum günstigen Preis angeboten. Abends gibt es Menüs und Tellergerichte, die auf einer bebilderten Speisekarte (für Touristen) ablesbar sind. Diese Gerichte sehen zumeist etwas unappetitlich aus, sind aber reichlich bemessen und mit etwas Glück schmecken sie sogar. Am besten schaut man den vielen hier anwesenden Asiaten auf Tisch und Teller und ordert deren Menüs nach. Überhaupt sind in diesem Lokal sehr viele Asiaten anzutreffen, die durchweg von der nicht bebilderten Karte bestellen.

Oh.My.God.Where do I begin?Dinner buddy and I recently came across the dine after nine website: dineafternine.ca  where normally high-end restaurants offer reduced-price menus for after 9pm and it's a total steal! We've decided we're going to hit as many of them as possible.So we started with Moishe's Steak house, a real Montreal establishment. This is the kind of place where steaks START at $50 (there's a reason why prices aren't listed on their website), the kind of old-world style of steakhouse where businessmen usually come to end deals, like Peter Luger's for instance in Brooklyn. The  after 9pm menu is far smaller than the main menu but nonetheless, it still gives you plenty of choices to have the whole Moishe's experience. I figured since I was going for the Rib steak, I wanted to start with something light and had the Caesar Salad. Nothing special but good nonetheless. My friend had the salmon tartare and loved it.Both of us ordered Rib steaks and people, it's official, this is the place where you will eat literally the best steak of your life, no joke. Ask for the spices and garlic on top. Crusty on the outside and seared to perfection and made as you wish, I had mine medium-well and it was perfect.  Get the Monte Carlo potato,  the best double-baked potato there is between here and Idaho. The coleslaw, the pickles, the bread, all of it outstanding.Both of us somehow managed to still have some space left for dessert, I had the classic chocolate cake and my friend had the creme brulee. There was not a note out of place anywhere.Moishe's has quite the reputation, while service is brisk, I'm happy that we ended up with a nice waiter. Nothing can turn a meal sour faster than a server with attitude. We ended up with the worst table, right by the door and kitchen but at least it gave us a great view of what was going on in the rest of the dining room and watch who else was strolling in. People say that Moishe's is a fancy dress place. Honestly, I didn't see that much class on display. I saw some real slobs walk in, t-shirts hanging out of jeans, social X-rays and ahem, "ladies of the night", escorts with businessmen and guys who looked like frat boys. The noise level is very high indeed. I have to say watching the parade of people on display is a bit like watching a show, quite colorful and quite the experience.My friend and I decided that we'll come back if at least to try out the rack of lamb.Seriously, just go.Went to Moishe's to try their friday/saturday after 9 menu + celebrate my 22nd birthday (Yay!)We had a reservation at 9:30 but weren't sat down until 9:50. The restaurant entrance was completely packed; guess we weren't the only ones trying to score a 30$ filet mignon.I ended up getting my filet only 30 minutes later (super quick service). The piece of meat was amazing although I would've appreciated a bit of seasoning on it. The Monte Carlo potato was simple and amazing- worth it for an extra 5$. Definitely would recommend to go try their after 9 worth it as the quality/price report is pretty good. However, if you're looking for a 4-5 star dining experience, you probably should stick to a decent dinner time as they seem to overbook the restaurant to really take every penny they can from this special. From what I have seen/experienced, Moishe's is a good traditional Montreal steakhouse and you should probably try it out at least once :)

Hmm oh dear, how the great can fall. I came here for a wee birthday dinner with some friends as last time Emily V and I came we really enjoyed it.The food was still good, if in fact even better. I ordered the same combo platter of tuna with crab flautus and this time my tuna was actually rare as requested (if a little cold). And the margaritas are goooood. I do need to give them that.But the service left a lot to be desired. The waiter was friendly, and smiling, and seemed like a nice guy. But it was incredibly slow, at times bordering on arrogant, and very cheeky.I arrived 10 minutes early to find Emily V already early herself. Waiting for two others, we sat. And waited. We were one of two tables. I saw many members of staff wandering to and fro. The waiter didn't look busy. He never came over to our table but when I finally managed to catch his attention and ask "could we please order some drinks?" he responded with "yeah I'll be over in a bit" in a very nonchalent manner. "In a bit". Not a case of "oh yes I'll be over" whilst grabbing his note pad. It was literally a case of "I'm not yet taking drinks orders". A bit turned out to be 10 minutes.Fine during the meal itself, but when it came to paying we paid by cash. It was taken away, and not returned. We waited again. And waited. And saw him clearing tables, serving other people, still no change. Eventually, the polite Brit in me overcame my anxiety of appearing rude myself and asked for the change, to which he brought it over straight away. This makes me think he was hoping we wouldn't ask for the change and leave the in excess of 20% change as tip. Which was really quite ironic considering how slow and nonchalent the service had been.It was also quite cold in the restaurant when we first got there and I didn't take my jacket off until the mains arrived. A small note but when you're eating hot, spicy mexican food you kind of want to feel hot and spicy not shivering.Now I don't know if I would go back. Their margaritas really are sooooo good and great value. I like I said the staff were nice, not flat out rude, but their attitude of 'serving us when it suited them' and the very cheeky trick with the change put me off slightly.

UN-FRICKEN-BELIEVABLE!!!!!Can I please get a ZERO stars option? Please?I am certain if you look back at all my reviews you will read somewhere where I boasted:     "There is no such thing as bad sushi!"      Well, guess what? -- we have found BAD sushi! Red Sushi Hibachi Grill has, was I would gently refer to, as the the "Worst Sushi on Planet Earth!"    No - "WORST SUSHI IN THE GALAXY!!"These people do not even pretend they are not terrible. The discerning look of utter disinterest on the face of my sushi chef, as he watched me scrape the layer of wasabi paste from the bottom of my fish and picked away at the mountain still on top of my rice, spoke volumes about this joke of a sushi bar. I was nearly floored by how he caked on the wasabi like a bricklayer building a wall.Of course it wasn't until I finished, with my 10 minute chore of scraping the wasabi from my fish, that I realized I should have kept it on. The Fish Was Nasty!  Let me say that again:     THE FISH WAS "DRAGGED THROUGH THE CRACK OF SOME DISHWASHER'S ARSE" NASTY! I was starting to wish I ate just the wasabi.I am so flabbergasted by the pure crap of this disgusting tourist trap, that I literally had a coronary when the bill arrived. At the bequest of my doctor, I am not supposed to go into detail about the bill - he fears it may kill me to talk about it again.      Uuuhh, my chest!   If you want to know what sushi DOES NOT taste like? - go to Red.   If you want to experience the "worst of the Worst"? - go to Red.   If you want to imagine Nobu Matsuhisa going Kamikaze on some place? - go to Red.   If you want Dishwasher Arse dragged over your tongue? go to Red.

You're not coming here for the service or food. You come here because you're drunk or hungover and need some greasy grub to fill your tummy. This place does that and then some.And at 4 am this place is a sure bet compared to most late night eateries in this city. Please note I have never eaten here sober, not because I have a drinking problem but because I never had the urge to go hete unless I wss wasted.

I can't believe I've probably walked by this place millions of times but never tried it until about a week ago.  It doesn't look like much from the street but inside a truly fantastic food experience awaits you.  The decor is cosy and the service is top notch.  Their focus is on French food and they do that well.When you sit down they bring you a plate of chorizo sausage, olives and carrots.   While the sausage is tasty don't fill up here because there is lots more to come!  To start we split a platter that included confit de canard, grilled shrimps, grilled mushrooms and fried calamari.  The calamari in particular were very well done.  They were crispy and cooked just right.  To add to that I ordered the duck in green peppercorn sauce.  The duck was well done and fell apart.  The sauce was a pleasant addition.  You could really taste the peppercorns and it was salted just right.  They also brought some fries to the table to be shared by everyone and those were quite good.I finished off the night with a chocolate lava cake.  This is one of my desserts so my expectations are always high when I order it.  Fortunately this one lived up to those expectations.  It was piping hot and they succeeded in leaving the interior uncooked.Portions are huge so come hungry or be prepared to share with your dining companions.  As for reservations they don't seem an absolute must.  While it was busy when I came you probably could have gotten a table without a reservation.

Was it the stinky, dimly lit Taiwanese place we were looking for?Nope.Was it surprisingly elegant, well staffed, and one of the better Chinese meals I've had out since moving to Charlotte?Ya!At first glance, the menu looks un-friendly to us veggies, but that is not the case. Any prep that can be done with tofu is available (and this is almost all of them). My Blackish Tofu (beef, on the menu) was good - oily prep, lots of dried red pepper flakes, some mushrooms and carrots thrown into the mix (plus bamboo shoots, odd). Tasty. Veg Tempura is not what we were expecting - somewhere between a pakora and..well...something, it was good, if a smallish serving for $6.If you come here knowing what you want, how to pronounce it in Mandarin, and they have the stuff in the kitchen to accommodate ya, they will - a table pal had what looked like a glutinous-rice omelette, shrimpys abounding. Neat. Makes me want to learn a second language.

Mums does exactly what it says on the tin. On the menu it states that, "We believe 'gourmet' can and should be for everyone... and value prices should never be an excuse to use inferior ingredients or to serve up microscopic portions, we know you know better and so do we."Love that. And that's just what they do.We came for breakfast and got a heart y breakfast. My gal got a solid portion of Eggs Bennedict and I got pancaked with tons of streaky bacon, and they both were tasty and cheap.Service was a little slow and we did wait to get in, but it was fine and we still made our Edinburgh Fringe show with plenty of time. It's never going to be gourmet but they know that and they do that well. Recommended.

My family and I had such a great experience at Om for our first Tibetan meal. While we've eaten plenty of Indian food, we were at a loss for what Tibetan food to order. Thankfully, Tashi our waitress was more than happy to assist us with order. Staff was very amicable and food was outstanding. Put Om on your list if you are looking for great Tibetan food. We will be back next time we are visiting Montreal.

First of, let me clarify... this is an one incident bad enough to warrant its own 1-star (if I can give zero, I would) review.After the Yelpy Award night, a few of us decided to get a bite and a drink to keep the party going.  It was about 10pm when we arrived, not late by any means for a bar.  We ordered food and drinks.  We were aware that our waitress is new (3 day old).  The service was a little slow, but what the heck, we're having a good time talking.  Then it dawned on us that it's REALLY REALLY SLOW.  As in 45, 50 minutes later we still haven't had food, and the waitress had barely came by. The place was virtually empty.  It doesn't take almost an hour to fix a few sandwich wraps and fries.  Plus people don't order food at 10pm unless they are just-got-out-of-prison hungry!  We started to voice out loud our frustration, I mean, last I checked I'm in the US and I have the freedom of speech to say whatever the heck I want as long as I don't scream "Fire!" in a crowded theater (I know I learned something in school...).  There was another waitress out on the patio doing clean up work.  And before we knew it, she HUFFED and PUFFED right by us and said LOUD ENOUGH for us to hear "F$#K, YALL ARE KILLING ME"I am not sure which school of waitressing this chick came from, but I'm damn sure that's unacceptable at anywhere.  And boy she picked the wrong table to F with... a table full of Yelpers?!  We eat for a living and we sure as heck have an opinion and the whole darn world is going to hear about it. Man, I was pissed... this chick done got my neck-twisting, finger-snapping side out of me.A NOTE TO MANAGEMENT (if you are reading): 1. Please tell your waitresses to NEVER be so rude to your customers. NEVER, no exception, even if the customer was rude (which we weren't).  I waited tables, so I had rude customers, go b!tch in the kitchen.  2. Keep your tables informed if there's some unusual wait time.  How the heck would we know you had a big take-out order if you don't tell us?  Let us decide if we want to wait (thus forfeit our right to complain) or not wait.  3. The F word is to be never used at any table for any reason whatsoever by your staff!    This is one of my fav spots in town, and it was such a disappointment to have to encounter this myself (on an empty Wednesday night to say the least).  I have sticked my neck out plenty of times for this place, and now I can't even use my usual line "I never had bad service here, ever" anymore

Review Text :
The Pita Pit is smaller and somehow feels grungier than the just steps away Pita Factory. The prices are about the same and the pita ingredients are pretty similar too.This place definitely services the post bar crowd, especially those coming out of Caesar Martini's at the end of the night since it's right across the parking lot.I dunno, over all this place gets a big fat 'meh' from me.I have never been in Pita Pit, but Carnegie Mellon catered Pita Pit in for some kind of speaker one day.  I didn't attend the speaker, but there was remaining free food.  Score.I had a gyro pita and some kind of steak pita.  The gyro one was definitely better.  A few reviewers have said this is healthy, but I don't think these are really "healthy."  They're healthy like Subway is healthy, you know?  The veggies were crisp and fresh, and the wraps were a great size.  I have no idea what the cost was so this review is strictly on taste.Would I trek over to the store to get the pitas on my own time?  Probably not.  But Pita Pit is good for a catered lunch if you need that kind of thing.

Blah. Always excited to try new south side fair I headed in on Friday, the place was dead and the TV's were blaring. I ordered the pulled pork sandwich and waited about 30 minutes for my order and it was horrible. The pork was fatty and dry and they tried to disguise it by adding a gallon of BBQ sauce on top. The sauce itself was too sweet and the side of beans tasted like chili. Overall it was barely edible. The tables were sticky and needed a serious wipe down. Hopefully the service and food improves with age.

This restaurant is rather delightful. While there seemed to be some backlog at the entryway, the general decor and ambiance makes this establishment feel classy. The tables are done well, the waiters (I decline to use the word 'servers' here on purpose) are attentive, and cooperative - this translates to better table side service.The wine menu is pleasant, and they serve free bruschetta. Their bread is also really soft, and served warm - pretty decent table balsamic vinegar. We both ordered pasta, and again, while the service time was a bit long (20 mins for a main dish), we were distracted by the appetizers. The restaurant also delivers on menu ingredients as listed for the dishes (lots of clams, bacon/ham, mushrooms, etc - none of the pretentiousness followed by a paltry portion). The dessert is accompanied with fruit and other sundries. No returned dishes, and well informed staff.In all, it was a great experience. For as large and well maintained an area, it was largely empty for a late Friday night dinner, but at about $50/person, the service is rather impeccable!

Review Text :
One of the worst Happy Hours in Vegas...or anywhere for that matter! We were tempted by this HH because it starts at 2:00pm and we had some time to kill waiting for friends to arrive in town. The bartender was pleasant enough. The $5 drink menu is very limited...sangria, shots of Jose, beer, well drinks (What Mexican restaurant HH does not include a HH margarita??? Apparently only this one...LAME!) The $5 food menu is also pretty limited. While we were deciding what to order we munched on some chips and salsa. We ordered the hot wings, nachos and two rum and cokes, because I don't do shots of Jose and THERE WAS NO HH MARGARITA...super lame. The drinks were small but the chips and salsa are really good. Here is the lowdown on the food:Hot Wings $5 - 3 sad little breaded wings. They looked and tasted like standard frozen industrial wings from Costco. Did I mention there were only 3 wings...for $5??? WTF?Nachos $5 - Ugh..how can you ruin nachos? A very small bowl of chips, covered in a tasteless black bean paste (I will let you use your imagination about what this dark, black paste looked like) and an orange substance that tasted like cheese in a can. The topping was sparse and only covered the top layer of chips, which I guess is a good thing because it was vile. I have honestly had better nachos from AM/PM. These were borderline disgusting and after two chips I had to stop eating them.This happy hour failed to make me happy, and actually made me a little sad and angry. HH FAIL!!!AVOID! AVOID! AVOID!T & T! It's dynamite! T & T! It tastes so right! T & T! Gives me a power load! T & T! Watch my butt explode!Bad AC/DC sample aside, Tacos & Tequila (T & T) is actually pretty good even though it's ridiculously overpriced even by Las Vegas standards. Seriously, this city will use any opportunity to overcharge you. On my last trip, they charged me 33 percent more for an escort because she had two legs and most of her teeth. Kidding. No really, I am kidding.When my 11 day work trip to Las Vegas bled into the fifth day (and into the weekend), I needed to unwind a bit by watching the first round of the NFL playoffs in a sports bar environment. I had passed by this joint on the way to work a few times, so I gave it a shot. Luckily, it filled the bill (in more ways than one).I walked up and asked for a table for one near a screen. Quickly, two pretty hostesses greeted me and sat me at the bar in front of some nice high definition screens. The bartender immediately put some chips and salsa in front me, asked if I wanted a drink, and presented the menu to me. Without question, the service at "T&T" is dynamite.Bad joke aside, the food is also awesome. My order was promptly taken and soon enough I was munching on some awesome chips and salsa, sipping on a drink, and high fiving sports fans around me. Eventually, my order came out with 4 tacos of various meats with melted cheese on top. They were freakin' delicious. The price is a bit steep for food and/or drinks. But then again, the more you drink, the better it all tastes, and the less price seems to matter. Remember, when it doesn't matter how much the drinks cost, it's always happy hour.Quite the attraction notwithstanding location. We were hungry and my feet were starting to bother me so we headed up to the escalator for some fish tacos.The menu was full of choices for burritos, enchiladas, and of course tacos.  I still asked the waiter if he would not mind changing it up for me for some grilled mahi mahi vs. fried fish tacos. I also asked him if they would put it on corn tortillas instead of flour. He most graciously said yes!  The fish was fine, and they put some sort of coleslaw on top, black beans with cojita type cheese on the side (yay no yellow cheese on anything) and the gratuitious orange colored rice. You get green and red salsa with chips. The salsas did have some nice flavor/spice to them.The menu also had some fun foo foo drinks but we were slowing down a little and ordered ourselves some coronoas instead.Prices were reasonable as well. Tit for tat it was a decent enough place for the neighborhood.Delish Cheese Enchilada & Chili Relleno with a Berry FinishSITREPWhile we were waiting to hit the clubs inside the LUXOR, my buddies Chris, Tkiller and I decided to hit T&T because, dam if we weren't already hungry, and we didn't want to wait on what we heard were going to be "gratuitous hoer'dorves" which would probably be snatched up fast if anything.THE SETUPT&T has a prime location right on the 2nd Floor store mezzanine level of the Luxor Pyramid, right as you get off the escalator in fact.  Since I guess everyone is hitting buffets in Vegas, there actually was NO LINE at this delicious boutique Mexican Restaurant, and so we grabbed the opportunity.THE MENUI'm all about enchiladas to be honest.  In fact, a cheese enchilada & chili relleno combo - with accompanying beans & rice - is my personal litmus test on how well I rate a Mexican restaurant and whether I will be back.  Let's just say that if I get to Vegas again and am in the mood for Mexican, I WILL be back here!THE FOODThe enchilada was absolutely delectable with a spicy mole sauce.  And the chili relleno was actually BIG & CRISP in it's battered shell and full of cheeses.  I was in heaven on this count.  But it got better because the refried beans were great, and mixed with the Mexican rice, and added salsa fresca and cheese salsa, made for a most excellent chip dip.  [And yes, I got quite full.]MARGARITASThe berry margaritas were outstanding, and in fact I got two.  Nice & limy tart but fully flavorful for all tastebuds and still with a bit of berry sweetness (mostly blueberry).  The damage for me was about $40, with the two berry margaritas actually more than the meal, but hey, it's Vegas.AMBIANCEThis is an open air restaurant in the midst of the Luxor Mezzanine, so there is quite a bit of white noise from the different areas of the hotel & casino activities that filter this way, especially with shoppers blitzing all around and conversing since this is the shopping level as well, and no sound barriers (no walls, no screens, no glass, etc.).  But once you get acclimated to that din, you don't notice it after awhile, and though I know some peeps are very particular about barriers, I'll make a point of noting that but am not going to deduct a rating when I'm really about the FOOD and the DRINKS.CUSTOMER SERVICEProps to our server and our hostess.  Absolutely darling gals - which got the *FLIRT* quotient on our experience there quite high with us guys.  But on top of that, Chris' droid and my iPhone were DYING and the gals let us charge up at their hostess stand, which apparently had a boatload of outlets all around it.  Bless them!And I will admit that for a HOTEL restaurant (as opposed to a stand-alone restaurant venue), this was quite an outstanding experience!THE LOWDOWNOne of the best Mexican restaurants I've been too, and actually the best one I've hit in Vegas.During my weird Vegas trip, none of my friends ate a meal together. I was the only foodie and everyone just fended for fast food between drinks. I wanted quick meal in the hotel (Luxor), but still wanted to be able to sit down so I ended up at Tacos and Tequila. I was in and out within 40 minutes which was pretty sweet.It would not be fair to compare a taco in Vegas to the tacos I eat in California, but naturally I still strayed that route. It's not the same as Mexican food in California, but it's decent if you need a taco or tequila fix. Complimentary Chips with Two Salsas - The chips were a little thick. I like fresh fried thick and crispy or thin corn chips, but I'm not a big fan of the in between tortilla chip where it's a little thicker and really hard but not too crispy. This was an in between chip. The salsas were fine, they gave a red and a green salsa. #1 Alambre Taco Plate (Grilled Steak, Bacon, Chile Poblano, Onion, Cilantro, Oaxacan Cheese on Flour Tortilla) - It says on their menu that this is their #1 item and looking at their other offerings, I would agree. The taco is full of diced steak and bacon with a mild kick to it from the poblano chile. The flour tortilla was rolled thin so that was a positive surprise (I like thin vs. doughy). The plate came with rice and beans and this is where it went wrong. The black beans were good, but the rice was undercooked and gritty. Rice is the filler item and it's not hard to get right.  C'mon man! If you are craving some beef tacos, I recommend getting Alembre tacos, either a la carte or as a taco plate. Let's just hope your rice turns out better than mine were.Service was good. I sat at the bar and they were fast with the water, chips and salsa and they did check on me after I received my food. They have flat screens with sports on in the bar area and they can fit sizable parties at the tables. Comparing to the other mid-range restaurants at the Luxor, T&T - Tacos and Tequila is probably one of your safer bets.In Vegas we stayed at the Luxor so we wanted to grab lunch somewhere convenient. T & T's is located inside the hotel up the escalator near the check in lobby. The lights are very dim up there but the seating area is nice.  It's kind of a romantic setting. They have a couple tvs where the bar area is. We were seated right away and our server stopped in to take drink orders. With checking into hotel we received a coupon for a free Margarita so we ordered one with waters. (We had already been drinking a bit so water sounded good) You can't mess up water, right? Well this was seriously the worst tasting water I have ever had. It tasted like toilet water and I haven't tasted toilet water before, but it was worse than tap. We didn't even drink it.They started us off with chips and salsa. I enjoyed the chips which were pretty thick.I actually enjoyed them better than thin chips. Salsa had good flavor too. I ordered two chicken tacos which came with rice and beans. The tacos had a little kick to it but I felt needed more cheese or lettuce. It was missing something. Rice and beans were okay, nothing special. It's a cool spot if you want to get some quick food in the hotel that isn't fast food.

I think with time this place will be pretty awesome! The food was pretty good for the most part and the service was great and extremely friendly. We went on a Friday night and the place was packed with what seemed like very happy diners. Highlights.. the pot roast was better then my mothers, ask for horseradish. The lamp chop special was great and a super bargain at 18 bucks. The hummus was really good but the pita was a problem, was very hard. Though I told the server and he brought out a fresh batch right away, was good.All in all this place is going to be decent after they work out a few kinks in the kitchen. Considering that they have never opened a restaurant before I think that they are doing a pretty good job though they need to QC the kitchen more.FYI, 18 bucks is the most expensive thing on the menu though most itms are 12 and under.. seriosuly cheap eats!yjeir desserts are great!get the meatloaf when it is on special!

Craving good Korean food, we decide to try out a newer place.  We've been driving by the Won Mi sign every time we're on Spring Mountain, so with a party of three, we figure we'd get a chance to try a few more dishes.Saturday evening, and we're the only customers.  Not exactly the best sign, but we're not dissuaded.  Workers are watching something on the TV, but get us to a table and provide some menus.With some help from the waitress, we put our order in and the banchan arrives.  About eight different kinds arrive on the table and we start digging in.  Now, this was some pretty good stuff.  They had bean sprouts, cabbage kimchee, eggplant, cucumbers, seaweed, potato, daikon, and spinach.  All of it was REALLY good and we definitely requested more of everything.* Dolsut Bibim Bap (Bibimbap in a Hot Stone Pot" ($12.99) - The Husband and friend thought it was good, but could be better.* So Bul Go Gi "Grilled Beef" ($18.99) - We all agreed this was really good, tasty and done well.  Served on onions.* Korean Spicy Tofu Soup - Not on the menu, but typical at every Korean restaurant.I'll admit, I mostly focused on the good banchan and the bulgogi, I didn't eat too much of the bibimbap or the soup.I was telling the Husband that this place would be the bomb if they served up shikye too.  (Especially since we noticed that  not many Korean restaurants in Vegas serve this simple complimentary dessert.)When the bill arrived, we asked the waitress if they had shikye.  She was surprised that we wanted it, but yes, they definitely did have it!  When she brought it out, she did say it wasn't that cold yet since they were just making it.  (We were just happy to have it!)Yes, service is a bit slow, only because the staff is either engrossed in the TV or in the back.  But it's not hard to get their attention for more ice cold bori cha when necessary.  The waitress even chatted it up with us for awhile too, which was a nice personal touch.  We'll probably be going back again.Total: $50, including tip and tax.Lunch specials from 11 am to 3 pm.

Look...up in the sky...it's a bird...it's a plane...it's...it's...Deli Man!!!Who?Yeah exactly...Deli Man is the superhero that welcomes you to this mess of a fast food joint in Montreal's Deli Planet restaurant.Picture Applebees minus the bad food. Yes it is that bad!Now granted, the location I visited was directly below my hotel. In Montreal they have an Underground City, which comes in handy when the weather is bad outside. Oh and it was bad. On a -30 degree day in this beautiful city I went underground and came across this happy looking place.I was in the mood for bad food. By "bad", I mean "greasy,cheese filled and fun" food...not "wtf is this?" food.Anyways here is what I ordered:Appetizer: Nachos Macho. Yes that is what it is called. No I did not call it that to the waiter. I hate places that give their food items stupid names, I am not saying "fruity tooty fresh and fruity" at IHOP and I will not say "Moons over My Hammy" at Denny's! Just say pancaked or scrambled eggs dammit!Oh yeah back to my review...now while I love my nachos...but this big bowl of chips with melted cheese, salsa, sour cream and jalapeno was just a big bowl of yuck. It came out cold and the chips tasted stale. I told them that the chips were cold, they offered to "warm" them up. Really? Are you going to nuke this mess and bring back a Nachos Macho Soup? I said I was not happy with this and they just stood there with a blank stare. I said I would not pay for this and the guy just walked away. Ha!?Main Course: Ordered the BBQ chicken. Meh...not going to say it was the worse chicken ever...but it surely was not tasty. Maybe because they gave me a side of mashed potatoes and the genius in the back poured mounds  and mounds of gravy all over my plate. I mean I love gravy, but this was ridiculous. Besides my gravy pool being everywhere, it was not even that good.I skipped dessert (shocked?)...and paid my bill, minus the nacho chips. Told the woman at the front counter on my way out that I was not happy with them and to look at my table (which was in view) and said that they were still there untouched. She agreed...I paid...and left this joint.Au Revoir.

That and an old-fashion style root-beer ran me $7 - well worth it! The sandwich was huge - but it was so tasty I tried to eat my second half ( although I was not successful!). The place is small but we didn't run into any crowds at noon. The service was fairly fast and friendly! There was not a place to eat the sandwich (my reason for 4 stars not 5)...who wants to eat at work ? ...They also close at 3pm so beware if you're craving a late afternoon Laurel Market snack. I will absolutely be back again very soon!

So good. Oh so good. So good for a hangover, or, so good for brunch with mom. Quaint little establishment with cute little waitresses bouncing around in tiny little shorts. My coffee cup was never empty, and even as I was leaving, my waitress was filling up my to-go coffee cup..  she gets my vote for the most wonderful person of the day. Their breakfast menu was pretty excellent, I got the Western scramble with mushrooms and it was cheesy delicious excellence. Very clean, and lots of seating.. I had read about the lines, but we got right in and right out. This place is exactly like The Good Egg.. but not as many senior citizens or bonnet wearing geese used as the decor.. I am a fan.Katy Perry ought to do the commercial for this place:U. S. Egg girls, they're just unstoppable,Daisy dukes and pancakes on top. . .More about that in a minute.  First, I'll talk about the food.  This is the first restaurant we went to when my family first rolled into Phoenix.  While their famous "protein pancakes" weren't my taste, I'm a big fan of their regular pancakes and think that theirs are about some of the best I've had.  Fluffy and tasty, they really hit the spot.And of course, the eggs.  At many places like IHOP or Denny's, you often get scrambled eggs cooked in this weird-tasting grease that leaves you with a burning sensation on your tongue.  At U.S. Egg, they're just tasty, and cooked in butter--delicious.  If you're looking for an opinion of their protein pancakes, just ask my wife.  She's really impressed by them and has ordered them on both occasions that we have visited.Okay, on to the customer service.  Another reviewer said below that "legs sell eggs", and he's right.  This is where my "daisy dukes" comment comes in--the servers are all women, and many wear shorts and brightly colored cosmetics.  Beyond their appearance, they tend to be nothing special, and sometimes aren't even particularly nice.  Getting their attention can be challenging.  Nothing horrendous here, but significant enough to dock a star.  Too bad--this would easily be a five star place if they really focused less on legs and more on helpfulness.If you are looking for a kick-ass breakfast, and don't mind some chilliness and a little bare skin from your server, U.S. Egg will do you right.  Sometimes there's a bit of a wait to get in--not surprising, and totally worth it!Well it is 12-12-12, a wonderful Day I think!!! Got up this morning and the coffee maker was not working.So we came here for breakfast. We have not been in a while so thought it is close we will go. Not too busy, and they have a very nice accomodating staff.We sat inside because, it is in the 50's this week(in the morning).Food is good , coffee is as well. You have to ask for Butter or else they will give you margarine.The water is tap water, so a lot of lemon will kill the taste of bitter and bad.Food is good I just wish they went more natural. Even all the jams are a bit gross.They cut corners here on certain things which really takes away from it all.Otherwise I would give them a 5 star.

Review Text :
I have this horrible affliction where I have to go to new restaurants when they open, I'm  very impatient. And I do this even though I know that newly opened restaurants inevitably have kinks to be worked out. I have been walking by Sens for months now and I've watched them put it together piece by piece and have been waiting for it to open. And what do you know, it opens the night of the Yelp party. Since I couldn't go to the opening, my husband and I decided to go on the second night. In reality this turned out much better because it was intimate and we were able to take a nice leisurely pace with the meal. Even the servers were saying it was better we came in when we did rather than for the opening since it was crazy and nobody really knew what was going on. I'm giving Sens 4 stars because yes, there are kinks to be worked out. I know that I will be there often given its proximity to my place and I fully anticipate giving it that 5th star once said kinks have been worked out. The Space- Think Asian diner/lounge. Yes, it is small, and the tables for two are not large enough to fit more than one plate at a time (slightly problematic for a place that serves small plates). There is a small lounge area off to the side which would make a really nice space for a semi private party. (They do take reservations, just call ahead). The bar and bar seating are definitely right in the main dining room. The Drinks- They sure know how to appeal to customers. We were offered complimentary shots of their infused drinks of blood orange sake (pass), pineapple sake (good), and lychee shochu (very good). My husband ordered a spicy mama, which had Thai chili infused shochu. My husband adores spicy drinks and this one really made him happy... reminded him exactly of the Thai chili martini that he gets at our favorite Thai place of all time in our hometown. The Food- There is nothing subtle about the food. Flavor is strong and very present. We chose four small plates, as we do in all small plate/tapas restaurants. We find four is always the perfect number. The first dish that arrived at the table was the clay pot lemongrass clams, which I would pass on in the future. The second dish was the volcano flamed beef which I would have to say was the best dish that we ordered, mainly because the flavors were the most subtle here- a little bit of peanut, a dash of mint. We did have 4 strips of steak and 2 lettuce wraps though, putting 2 strips of steak into one wrap was a bit much for me. The third dish was the seseme tofu which was very well cooked. Finally we finished with the ginger fish. When fish is cooked in a banana leaf it should absorb all the flavor from the cooking method, there was no reason for heaps of ginger to be placed on top of the fish. It was incredibly overwhelming. Our side of soba noodles were standard, even if they were delivered to our table after all of the other plates had arrived. They do not offer dessert so don't plan on having it there. The Service- All the servers were very friendly and engaging. They did feel the need to tell us how to eat every dish we ordered which I found annoying. I know there are a lot of people out there who have no clue but its best to ask us if we know how to cook our meat on the hot rock (sort of shabu shabu style). All in all I can see myself here often. The price is just right- the four small plates were more than enough to satisfy my husband and I for dinner and they came to $32 total. They do have kinks to be worked out and the food is not the best I've had but I am positive it will be part of our regular rotation.The food was pretty tasty, but it's definitely got a little bit of the "over the top" not quite "authentic" feel to it. Everything seemed just a little too commercialized to me which is why I gave it a 3 instead of a 4.Their Sake menu is reason enough to go back, but be prepared to spend a little. It is a tapas only, we ordered 6 tapas between two of us just to feel satisfied. The cheapest tapas on their menu are about 4 or 5 bucks, but there's only 2 or 3 things that are that cheap, and I think they were mostly the vegetarian tapas. Most of the tapas seemed to average out at about 7 bucks. So with sake and tip, you probably average out at about $40 a person. I would definitely suggest getting a side of rice to help fill your belly.They did an awesome job of atmosphere in the restaurant, and Johnny Chu came out several times to make sure we were enjoying our food. They also had a D.J. who did a great job of choosing GOOD music to play while we ate.  I'm just not sure that the timing was right for them, not very many people in downtown are quite ready for a place like this on a regular basis. Sadly, we were the only 2 people in the restaurant for about half of our meal at about 7:30 on a Friday night.I love sens a five star now. I would say that there was a complete turnaround in 2.5 months. Service issues are fixed, they pour a mean vodka tonic, the wasabi tofu has maintained its amazing tastiness and I really like the location.Now if only I could get someone to make sweet sweet love to me in the bathroom.So......... I'm pretty sure the bartender was wasted.Other than that I really enjoyed my experience here. The food was awesome and the drinks were strong. Any place with infused vodka(s) is alright in my book by default. It's just that I'm about 96.3% sure that the bartender was wayyysted. It was distracting. It seemed like the more we drank, the more fucked up she became (not to mention she kept "excusing herself for a moment" ahem..... ) sniff sniff?? one never knows..Anyway, everyone blowing Chu reminds me a lot of everyone blowing Bianco, which is a little annoying, but I do get it. He is an amazing chef and a very nice guy. I'm dying to go back on a night when I can really spend some time and try everything on the menu. Yes, everything... small plates people and this girl can put it down. One last thing.... after reading the last hand full of reviews, I don't recommend touching ANYTHING in that bathroom.I kidI kidOK, so I sort of promised Amber W that I wouldn't give Sens a bad review after a dining experience this weekend. 3 stars isn't bad, but it's not good either. First off, I have been here 4 times now and figure that is enough to judge. The place is cool, I will give it that. A new, hip downtown Asian tapas place. It's a small menu in an even smaller venue, but a place to be seen. The have a good beer selection and have my new favorite, a Japanese White Ale. It is really tasty. Dally enjoys the Hot n Dirty, which is a dirty martini with chili infused vodka. Lets just say it is an acquired taste. On this particular night they were able to accommodate a party of about 15 of us. That was great, it being such a small place. Here is where it goes south. We order. Our lovely waitress Morgan is kind enough to split everyones bill. I ordered some sort of sugar cane pork. I got it 1.5 hours later! Other diners food came out randomly, if at all. It was OK, but I am not really sure that is what it even was though. The other time I had food there it was a shrimp and pork dumpling which was very bland. The one thing I have had which is good are the fried wontons. Thanks Georgie! Overall it is a cool place. Take a date there who has never experienced downtown and it will impress her or him. Whichever. 3 stars for now. I will have to go back and give them another shot.I'm really torn on Sens. Great location. Great atmosphere. Great vibe. I get the idea of Asian tapas, but I felt like such a pig because, even though I snacked before we went, I was still hungry when we left. However, I must say that what we did eat was all very good. I ordered the Soup Gyozo (very tasty) and Thai Basil Clams (spicy goodness!). We also had the Spicy Wonton, which was phenomenal, and a few other items (which aren't coming to mind as I already started celebrating St. Patrick's Day). Their cocktails are inspiring and properly strong. I'll definitely return to Sens, but not on an empty stomach. Sorry, but I'm really a porker at times.Been here a few times now so it's time for the review.  Walked up to the hostess on a Saturday night and she asked if we had reservations, I said "no" because I didn't think this place was like that but then spending some time here it kinda makes sense, or Sens. Haha.So one time ended up getting 6 (maybe a few more but the beers were going down pretty easy that night) different items.  Each one well thought out and fun to eat.  Yes, I said fun. One was cooked by us on a hot rock, and the others made us investigate each tasty bite.Yup, the portions are small, but they're darn good vittles I tell ya.  Oh yeah, and they have a DJ so they get a few extra hipster points.to date, i have been to Sens twice now, oddly enough as a guest to two of the bartenders at the Turf. was drinking on a Saturday night when one of the bartenders who was off the clock was hanging out, asked if i wanted to head over to Sens and grab a bite to eat. i obviously said "Yes" so we walked across the hallway and up to the bar, it was 2:25 or so and the kitchen staff was cleaning up, she asked if the kitchen was closed or if they can still serve food, we got a nod of approval and quickly put in an order, two plates of the Duck+Mint+Ginger salad, an order of Soup Gyoza and Shu Mai. everything was excellent, the Duck salad is amazing 5 stars for sure. the dumplings were both excellent as well. the graciousness of bar waitress and the kitchen staff was amazing considering the time. second time eating at Sens, was not quite harmonious. i was asked previously to my first visit if i wanted to try sens, and while neither myself or the bartender requesting my presence had been here yet, i agreed and we agreed upon a time and date where she would be off work around the same time i would get home from work.  we headed over to Sens, now at this point I've already had some experience with the menu and the food, plus I'm not a stranger to asian food. this time i ordered the Soup Gyoza, Fried Tofu and the Sugar Cane, my accompaniment tried the Miso with shrimp.now this is where i cannot justify a 5th star....i received all 3 of my dishes before they even started her Miso soup. :(i held off eating while we both waited for her food, i offered some of my selections as it was enough to share and still be happy with it. but it still didn't put off the annoyance of not having your own dish in front of you. it was finally served a long 8 minutes later, roughly, and she liked it. only complaint beyond the delay was that the shrimp were a little overcooked.all in all good experiences for trying something fairly new. I'll certainly return, price wasn't all that bad and the drinks are pretty good. but nothing i would go there for strictly. I'm not a huge fan of sake or vodka. they do have other things to pore, but the drink specialties are all sake or vodka. :\Was it just an off night? I had high hopes for this place and was sorely disappointed. Went on a Monday and the place was dead. I know my fellow yelpers may stone me for this review but here goes:To start - I found the décor to look a bit cheesy, like design on a dime but they only spent a nickel.. What's up with the glass jars full of paper confetti? The music was too loud and the lights kept getting darker and darker, by the time we got our food we could barely see.Our waitress was nice and recommended her favorites. So many people have raved about this place, but I found the fusion either bland or overspiced. Shabu Hot and Sour was served first - This soup had no spice to it at all, even the side dipping sauce provided had no spice. The lime broth, while providing nice flavor to the veggies was too overpowering to eat, so we just picked out all the veggies. Spicy Wontons came out next - Chicken and pepper jack.. This tasted as though it had been frozen for ages, no flavor and very little amount of chicken.Volcano Beef - Nice touch on the "sear it yourself" hot rock. We could see the beef was marinated, but we couldn't taste it and the garnish accompanying it was loaded with too much ginger. At this point we were so disappointed with the food, and still hungry. We left and walked down the street to Moira, another disappointment. Review to follow.Dinner at Sens was, hands-down, one of the best meal-experiences we've had here in Phoenix. Four of us (2 couples) made reservations at Sens for 6:30 on a Saturday night. It was a good thing we had reservations, because shortly thereafter, the place was packed. Sens is not a place to grab a quick bite; rather, this is the place to go to use all of your senses (get it?) - taste, smell, see, hear ... the music was great, the lighting was nice, and the food was amazing. We started off with some drinks. I was intrigued by their infused Shochu ( a Japanese vodka). To start, I tried the lychee-infused Shochu with club soda. My friend also enjoyed the lychee Shochu but with club soda and a splash of cranberry juice, while her husband tried the logan Shochu chilled and straight up. My daring husband opted for the chili-infused Shochu, which was incredibly spicy. Not long thereafter, the waitress asked if he wanted it made into a martini, so he chose the "Hot and Dirty" (which was like a dirty martini, but made with the hot chili Shochu). Later, I tried the ginger-infused Shochu and the Lemongrass-infused Shochu. GREAT DRINKS! To eat, we dined like royalty on the following dishes:La Nho, lemongrass marinated beef wrapped in grape leaves.Volcano Flamed, thinly sliced beef seared on hot stone. The beef actually comes to the table raw, and you literally cook it for 40 seconds per side on a hot stone. Very cool.Shu Mai, wasabi pork and shrimp dumplings. Very tasty, with a kick!Papaya Mango Salad with shrimp in a lime vinegarette.Wasabi Soy chicken breast, marinated and served with rock salt wasabi.Lemongrass Soy chicken breast - this was probably my favorite dish!Spicy Wonton filled with sauteed chicken and pepperjack cheese.Red curry tofu - We ordered a side of steamed rice, which you really have to do in order to enjoy all of the amazing sauce in this claypot dish.and, finally, Quail seasoned with aromatic rock salt.I would order everything all over again. I loved that we got to try a little bit of everything, and we had such a fun time eating, chatting, drinking ... It was hard to leave! On a side note, I had the opportunity to chat with owner/executive chef Johnny Chu about the creation of Sens vs what's happening over at the restaurant-formerly-known-as-Fate. Johnny has taken the old Fate menu and infused it into the Sens lunch menu. He's also not involved with what used to be Fate (they are now calling it 905), so if you loved the old Fate, you need to find your way over to Sens!Okay, I will preface this review by saying, I was extremely hammered when I came here, so the level of awesomeness I remember may or may have not been altered by that fact. Either way, I REALLY liked this spot.I got cozy at the bar with my guest under the funky blue lighting and soon after was joined by the Executive chef, Johnny Chu. What a wonderful wonderful man. He spent a decent amount of time chatting with us, which was cool. He really is a prime example of why I absolutely adore chefs. The only thing I tried food wise was the Wasabi Tofu, which was really good, but watch out, the first bite is REALLY hot, in every way. Excellent drink selection, but like I said, I had already had enough.. thus I am looking forward to revisiting Sens in a more sober state, very very soon!I finally went to Sens and was not disappointed. It was like Asia. In San Francisco. In Phoenix.The hostess sat my lovely lady and I in a corner and it sooo made me want to make out, but it was our first date, and alas I am a perfect gentleman. We were in the room up front, right next to the garage door that isn't. Word is, they're gonna blow out the front of the restaurant to allow for outdoor seating as soon as Chu cuts down the giant 75 year-old palm tree out there. (Update: Palm tree is now gone. Green people shant fret, though. I mean, it's not like it was a 200 year-old Redwood or something. Besides ... upon hearing the news, I lit a candle and planted a baby ficus in my own back yard in memoriam. So that's kinda' like a carbon offset. Or something.)I could have sworn our server was Asian. Turns out she was Jewish. And awesome. Jinia (that's her awesome name) could tell I was having difficulty deciding (or perhaps she just grew impatient with me in her own sweet way), so she simply asked us our likes and dislikes, in general, and if we had any food allergies or intolerances, and she proceeded to make the decision(s) for us. It was great! And unless you're an experienced Sens patron and already know what you do and don't love, I'd highly recommend going this route. It was kinda' like chef's choice, except it was Jinia's choice.And Jinia did not disappoint. Since we weren't doing the ordering ourselves, I'm not even sure what all we had. But it was all tasty. And I love that the portions are what they are - tapas size - so it allows you to try many different things rather than simply ordering one giant entrée and being stuck with it, for better or worse. Among other things, I do know we had the Soup Gyoza and the Spicy Wontons. Oh ... and the Volcano Flamed was clever. (You get to sear your own beef carpaccio on a hot stone. I messed ours up and it turned out more like beef jerky, but that was my bad. I own that.) Also had a soup and a salad, the names of which both escape me however. The tea with the blooming flower was a pleasurable experience as well. Not only was the tea delish, but watching the blossom do its thing in the teapot was sorta' like watching one of those time-lapse nature videos back in middle school.The cucumber-infused hydro has ruined me for all other table water. About this I am upset. But overall it was a great dining experience, thanks to the good food and even better service. I will indeed be back once they finish the overhead door conversion and I can sit outside under the aberration of shade cast by the once present giant palm tree that is no longer. And make out.It has been a year-and-a-half since my last review update, and I still cannot get enough of Sens. I'm here at least 2-3 times a month, sometimes even twice a week!I really appreciate the love and dedication that Johnny puts into his craft. He cares about the quality and taste of every meal that comes out of his kitchen, the way his staff interacts with customers, and the overall ambiance of the restaurant. I think he has mastered this craft.Being a vegan I have a plethora of options, which makes me very happy! The mango papaya spring rolls are incredibly refreshing and pair well with the spicy peanut chili sauce, the wasabi tofu is a great crunchy and spicy transition into the incredibly flavorful Hong Kong Flat Rice (I add tofu) or Spicy Saigon with Tofu. Both dishes are loaded with snow peas, cauliflower, onions, and carrots and tons of flavorful sauce in a skillet with crunchy tofu.Another chart topper for me is the hot and sour soup with tofu. Try the sweet chili sauce that comes on the side for a sweet, spicy, and salty adventure! The red tofu curry is amazing as well. VERY filling. I'm a huge fan of the plain 'ol vodka tonic, but love that they infuse their own vodkas with a variety of things like chili's and lychee. Dallas G LOVES the "hot and dirty" and I am also a fan of the "Cucumber chill." Although I cannot drink beer anymore, the White Ale is a chart topper.They also have a great selection of Sake. I took part in their sake tasting last night and became a fan of several new sakes! We downed a bottle of Pure Dawn and were really excited to see the discount after partaking in the tasting! Bonus!Overall, Sens is definitely my favorite restaurant. The food, the drinks, the love.... and we know all of the waiter/tresses so it makes for an even better experience!PS... Still love the bathrooms ;-)The last time I was here I went with two female co-workers who were mildly obsessed with the idea of me dating our waiter. I'm no stranger to objectifying cute male wait staff (cough*Roka Akor*cough), but even I felt uncomfortable for him after he had to endure approximately 3 hours of merciless cougar flirting followed by loud encouragement for me to take a more active approach to my dating life by hitting on him. I felt like I was having dinner with my two pimps, but he was a total pro about it and it ended up being an incredible meal!I had been to Sens once before where I had the most amazing Pimm's Cup ever. I freaking love Pimm's Cups, and only a handful of places in Phoenix serve them, so when I get a good one, I remember it vividly (well, as vividly as i can remember things that occur on patios at 1:00 AM on a Saturday).  After going for dinner a few weeks ago, I had the same thing and it was just as good, even though I wasn't nearly as drunk as I was the first time. Since my BAC fluctuates like Kirstie Alley's waistline, that's about all the consistency I can ask for.We ordered a ton of food, which seems to mostly be served small-plate style with 4 or 5 servings per order. This is perfect for me, because I tend to get bored easily and after a few bites of the same thing, I'm ready for something else (this might explain why my co-workers feel the need to take control of my dating life).  Everything we ordered was fantastic! We started off with sizzling shrimp in a spicy red sauce. The shrimp was perfect and sauce was actually spicy. Nothing pisses me off more than when restaurants cater to the wimpy masses by having their "Spice-O-Meter" equivalent to that of a kindergartner with an ulcer. The soup gyoza, bacon wrapped dates, sugar cane pork, and bacon wrapped okra were all just as good.  For dessert we had bacon-wrapped lychees (bacon was clearly the theme of the evening) and it was pretty much the perfect conclusion to the fantastic meal.Even though I've only been to Sens twice, it's slowly creeping up my list of favorite restaurants in Phoenix and will probably only continue to climb as I visit more often. Maybe next time I won't bring my pimps (but no promises).Sens is, well, SENSational!I love tapas style of eating. And unlike yogurt and cupcakes, tapas, I think, is here to stay! Sharing food with friends is perhaps one of my all time favorite things to do. Some people like camping. Some people like How I Met My Mother. Others scrap booking. My gig? Friends. Food. Sharing. So we gathered here yesterday after enjoying fantastic cocktails and my favorite nachos at Bliss to have some serious food. I shared my two favorite things here, the SOUP DUMPLINGS...omg...omg...pounding fists on table...total mouthgasm. You know when you get the squirt of gooey cheese from the middle of pasta shell in your fave mac n cheese? This is so similar. Hot, salty broth exploding as you bite into tender pork and savory cabbage. Pure heaven! Really, who doesn't like things exploding in your mouth? My other love is the White Ginger fish, whitefish steamed with a soy ginger sauce. And I loves me some ginger. Even on Gilligan's Island, I was a Ginger man, not a Mary Ann. I mean really, pigtails?! Tender, mild and absolutely off the charts with some very enjoyable flavors.Miss for me on this visit were the Korean short ribs...ugh...flavor was there...just couldn't chew the damn things. Also on the dry side and simply just very pedestrian was the Wasabi Soy Chicken.But, with the fabulous company I had and the Asahi beer and the chilled sake, it still measured up to a four star evening. Service was great as well. Patient, good-natured waiter, took care of eight buzzed and chatty diners!So Sens...you get me. With your tapas style menu. Your downtown vibe. Chilled sake.And. The. Soup. Dumplings. SENSational indeed!

Restaurant name  Tortas Paquime
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
¿Dónde es la peda?Over effing here.  I've only been here a few times but I love it!  I've had their quesadilla paquime, a few bites of my friend's ribeye tacos, their tortas cubana, and some other bites here and there.  Everything I've had here has always been fresh and flavorful and the portions are decent for their price.  As for their horchata... delicious and refreshing!Tortas Paquime is a casual dining spot that's always busy.  Don't forget to make a stop at their salsa bar.  They also have huge cases of baked pastries and a very impressive ice cream bar.  I have yet to try their sweets but they look pretty damn amazing.  The staff is friendly, the place is clean, and there's ample parking all around.  Thumbs up for yummy tortas!  ¡A huevo!Way out west, we're saturated with hit-or-miss little Mexican spots. Paquime is definitely a hit, specializing in sandwiches and desserts. So many kinds of desserts. First, I'd tried the chocolate chip ice cream. The consistency and richness of it lets you immediately know it's the real deal, and will be totally satisfying. I also tried the nuez or "nut" ice cream...I think it was pecan? I'm not sure. Could not be any more vague...it tasted to me like pancake syrup ice cream, which I didn't like, but my breakfast-loving dining companion fell in love with. After a few minutes, my quesadilla was ready (ha! I didn't even get a torta!). Instead of having precooked steak like a lot of the competition, it looked and tasted like it was made fresh to order. It was complete with tomato and avocado slices. I must admit it was a little skimpy--I ended up tasting everything *but* the cheese every other bite...but it was still tasting great, even if a bit on the small side. I'll update you when I actually try the main attraction here, a torta with fries. But until then just know that you're getting some good quality stuff for the price, and that even if you're just feeling pastries or ice cream, Paquime is still worth dropping by.

Restaurant name  Au Pied de Cochon
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
"Au Pied De Cochon" means "at the pig's foot," and they're known for their huge roasted pork leg dishes, but Chef Martin Picard should change the restaurant's name to something more appropriate. "At the Fountain of Foie Gras" or "At the Teats of Heaven." Well, they don't serve teats I think, but they do serve Christ's Ears -- "oreilles de Christ," a Quebecker sugar shack favorite of deep fried pork rinds smothered with maple syrup. PDC serves Quebecker food. Not French, not Canadian -- Quebecker. If all Quebecker food were as good as PDC fare, I would quickly die a very plump, very happy man.Plogue a Champlain. It deserves its own review. Calisse de crisse, this dish is mindblowing! Dessert? Breakfast? Appetizer? Entree?  I'll describe. Take half a lobe of fresh foie gras and pan sear it so that the outside is crusty, while the inside is still moist and springs back to the touch. Stack it atop brie, atop shredded potatoes, atop a buckwheat pancake garnished with two strips of locally grown bacon. Smother generously with real maple syrup. Put the dish in a fiery hot brick oven until you can't stand the wait anymore. Take it out. Take a bite. Now devour the rest. Okay, you can die now.The plogue alone is worth five stars. It's the best thing I've ever eaten. And I've had it many times since my life-changing first. I could stop at the plogue and never touch another menu item. But wait -- there's more! PDC's brick oven-baked pork chops with rosemary and white wine are the best pork chops I've ever had. I ordered the one-pounder (500g) thinking it would be far too much. To my deep regret, it was so good, I wish I had ordered their 2-pound (1kg) cut. More than enough meat for any man. But wait -- there's more! We haven't even touch the pig's foot!Yes, pork trotter -- pig's foot. Stuffed, braised, baked. It's amazingly, succulently, stupendously supple and tender and tasty. And it comes with or without foie gras stuffing. You can get foie gras with anything. You can get it atop poutines -- Quebec's quintessential dish of squeeky fresh cheese curds and fries drowned in hot gravy. You can get it by itself. You can try it for yourself. You can have foie gras and hams, Sam-I-Am.Every ingredient is from a local farmer. Everything is hand-made -- they even brew their own PDC beer. Every time I've gone, every person working there has been beyond gracious. Everything I've said above is why Au Pied De Cochon has been a smashing success since its opening in 2001. Make reservations, folks. I doubt they ever run out of pig's foots, but I know they run out of seating every night.PDC is world class. If the exchange rate weren't so hellish, I'd be there now, enjoying the marvelous Montreal summer and PDC -- the second best thing about Montreal.P.S. Please, please don't bring your vegetarian friends unless I'm there to laugh. =) Says Picard, "When you go to a restaurant to eat salad, you have a problem."P.P.S. #1? Les copines. ;)This was one of our favorite meals in Montreal. I love game meat, I love foie gras, et j'adore la cuisine Québécoise, so I was in heaven here. However, you should probably not go here and expect an elegant fine dining experience. It's pretty small, very crowded, and very loud, and has a very casual interior with wooden tables - it's not a place you necessarily need to get dressed up for. You definitely need a reservation if you don't want to stand waiting for hours; we had a reservation and got seated within about 15 minutes, but there were people who got there before us that were still waiting 2 hours later.  Despite the inventiveness of the menu and the relatively high prices, the food is not really haute cuisine per se. However, that does not make it any less delicious, in my opinion. The foie gras section on the menu has over 10 selections, but some of them make you go "whaa...?", like foie gras poutine and foie gras hamburger. The atmosphere is a lot like my favorite restaurant back home, which is not too fancy but just has really good food. The wine list was excellent with an extensive French selection. We started out with a bottle of Pouilly-Fuissé, but since the bottle we ordered was not available, the manager brought us out a Pommard he said was even better and was also less expensive, which was very nice. We started out with a plate of mixed pâté and some zucchini blossom tempura - the tempura was very light and pleasing. We moved on to two more delicious dishes, a tomato tartine and tarragon bison tongue. The tart was on this light fluffy pastry dough, and the bison tongue was extremely tasty. By that time we had moved on to a bottle of Old Vine Châteauneuf-du-Pape, also excellent. Our main course was the foie gras poutine - just had to do it - seared foie gras on top of fries, gravy, and cheese curds, and it was everything I thought it would be. I figured I was probably only going to have poutine once so it might was well be the most decadent. We finished things up with a dessert of maple churros, espresso and cognac. Afterwards the manager came by our table and brought us each a complimentary shot of Bushmills and drank it with us. It was just a really great experience.P.S. I read a quote about this place afterward that gave me a smile: "No animal is safe from his kitchen"Being Québecois I always have a soft spot for Cuisine du Terroire and without a doubt, Le Pied de Cochon is its Mecca. Martin Picard, the owner and chef of PDC has a penchant for my number favorite food stuff of all time: Foie Gras. His menu is littered with Foie Gras. The menu has items and then with added Foie Gras just to make it even better. Just with that he would score points with me. I was simply unprepared for the ways he presents Foie Gras and it changed everything.You're probably saying "Dave, you're going overboard here, Foie Gras is good but it's not life altering" to which I answer "Sit down, shut up and read on" because you obviously haven't been to PDC and have experienced what I have experienced. I'm sure it's the kind f elevating sensation those religious people experience during conversion.It started with The Cube or as the menu calls it Foie Gras Cromesquis. When your plate is presented the waiter has to give you some instruction first. He explains that it's a Foie Gras Terrine breaded and then deep fried. The terrine is now liquefied so you must wait a minute or two for it cool down and when you do bite down on it, keep your mouth closed. I looked at him with incredulous eyes. I take hold of the breaded cube, put it on my tongue and closed my mouth as the waiters behind the bar looked on, I bit down on it and then... time... stopped... My eyes closed and I wanted to say something but the Cromesquis exploded into a liquid spray of flavor napalm. At that very moment I could have died and it would have ok. This was only the beginning.I then continued this blissful expedition to culinary perdition with an off-menu item that was offered to us. Fried-Head cheese on a Gribiche sauce. The Head-Cheese was breaded with a smear of goat cheese on top and the Gribiche was just so good that I cleaned out the plate. The head cheese was so far beyond what I expected. The meat tastes so much stronger and is more diverse in flavors. Unbelievable and the best head-cheese I've ever had in my life.Did you think we we're done with entrée? Oh HELLLLL NO. Picard mixes Quebec's masterpiece of fast-food with Foie-Gras and turns into an orgasmatron of taste and sensation. Poutine with Foie Gras. Just the idea was mind-boggling and the execution was akin to sex with a very willing firm horny barely legal co-ed. I've had a lot of Foie Gras before but this was simply the most textured, flavored and fragrant one I ever tasted. I just wanted to bash my head on the bar it was so good.I ordered the restaurant's namesake dish, The Pied de Cochon. Pied de Cochon translated means Pig's Foot. And that's what it was. A whole pig's foot and some of the leg too. It was MASSIVE. The meat is removed braised and then stuffed back in the breaded leg with the hooves. It's layed on a bed of mashed potatoes then covered with a medley of tasty and very aromatic veggies, some of which I failed to Identify. Oh and yeah with a cherry on the top, another artery clogging portion of Foie Gras. The plates was enough to feed a family of rufees for a week and it was impossible for me to finish it but trust me that no meat was left on the plate, just the hooves and some veggies. Pig's leg is easily the tastiest part but it's work to get at sadly and probably explains why my mother only made Pig Leg Stew once a year.I decided to attack the desert menu. I quickly spotted Pudding Chômeur (poor mans pudding) I had to try Picard's take on this cultural institution. I was not dispointed, it was dessert heaven - though my mom's Pouding chômeur was light years beyond his - and a brilliant close on the evening.The service was top notch friendly and unpretentious. If you've ever seen Picard's show, he looks like a lumberjack, he's not anything like a snotty pedantic chef, he's all about good food and he'll go and kill it himself to get it on the plate. So his staff is equally relaxed and approachable. I'm not big on chi-chi restaurant experience and this restaurant looks like a sugar shack and is very laid back while still having 2000$ wine bottles on its wine list. Fine Dinning without the dickishness.Le Pied de Cochon is by far the best restaurant, culinary, eating experience I've ever had and I can't even begin to explain why. All of the above are mere ramblings of a mad man drugged by an experience that will not soon be overcome. I seriously doubt I can find another food experience to top my carnivorous proclivities anytime soon. Best Foie Gras ever, awesome head cheese, sublime Poutine, insane Pig's Feet. It took me about 3 days to come down from the rush. There is a God and his name is Martin Picard.Au Pied De Cochon isn't for the faint or weak. Not for the faint of stomach (think duck fat and pork), faint of heart (think duck fat, pork and your arteries) nor the faint of wallet (think duck fat, pork and a  reputable name that costs money to even utter).Call in your reservation weeks, even a month or so in advance. This is no walk-in spot. Please do not bring your squeamish friends here as they will not enjoy the experience, and you may not either. Also, do eat lightly the day of because this meal will consume and overtake your body, and also that part of your brain that controls  food comas. Our reservation was called in a couple of weeks in advance, and we got an 11pm block on a friday night.  We arrived and were seated immediately.  The restaurant itself isn't cabaret. No flashing lights or people in pig costumes. It blends with the surrounding establishments on its block, ninja-like if you aren't keeping a good look out. The ambiance is actually very casual, and upbeat. Oh and their piggy icon is very symbolic of this spot, a little bit comical, a lot fatty.We wanted to sample a lot of different things: two orders of the foie gras poutine, the infamous duck in a can, pied de cochon stuffed with foie gras, boudin maison, and côte de cochon heureux.The foie gras poutine was heaven on a plate. With every bite, I could hear angels trumpeting behind me. I scooped up the last bit of it with our complimentary bread. Never knew I could fall in love with something so alien to me. Duck in a can! Literally. It's quite a sight and very photo/vid worthy to catch them serving this up to you. Taste-wise, the amount of duck fat in there would make a roll of papertowels run away, but it ridiculously succulent.Stuffed pied de cochon swims underneath a rich, glorious brown gravy, if you're lucky, you'll find some semi crispy skin under there. I know I did. Boudin maison was a delectable porky tenderness as well, probably the more conservative of the dishes. Wasn't a fan the last dish on our list because there was just way too much blood sausage, which I have never been a fan of. To cap this artery-clogging feast, and about 1:30 am,  we got brazilian coffee. Hot, creamy and liquor-y.Unforgettable experience best saved for the brave.While most restaurants that I've been too in my various trips to Montreal have been generally very good, few have set a culinary standard that my visit to Au Pied de Cochon has. I had not been there on the two previous trips but after hearing even more hype about it, decided to make it happen last weekend while in Quebec. I had made a reservation almost two months before the date of the dinner and it was rather easy, done right over the phone. Just a day before the dinner, the restaurant called me to confirm it.I must admit that I had been looking forward to it for a while after salivating over the menu on their website. One thing that I did notice was how authentic it was; how well it reflected not just the local ingredients, but also the approach and tradition of the Province of Quebec. Anyone reading the menu should easily be able to determine the type of food that you'll be experience and in this case it's rather easy. It features dishes that are somewhat on the fatty but yet very tasty side, something that has helped the locals survive the harsh winters. Some of their proteins offered are bison, beef and also a lot of duck dishes as well. Duck as a matter of fact is their specialty - the culprit dish is duck in a can ($37): a duck breast, a piece of foie gras, some balsamic glaze, some garlic and some thyme, all sealed into a custom-labeled tin can and cooked to perfection. The dish is revealed tableside and is poured from the can and into your plate and the can placed onto the table next to your plate.  But enough on that and more about what I actually ordered and ate.After taking a good look at the categorized menu, whose dishes are sorted by protein-type, I decided, after much hesitation to get the assiette de cochonailles (pork charcuterie plate). It featured some pickled tongue, three large portions of delicious pâté, some headcheese, some pork sausage and even some aspic. On the plate were also half of a hardboiled egg and some corn salsa. At $9.50, it was probably the single greatest value I've ever seen and having eaten most of it, I was already almost full. Everything was great although I was not a big fan of the tongue that I found too pungent - The bread was perfectly toasted and I think that the highlight of the dish was the pâté which was out-of-this-world. Not having any idea as to the portion sizes, I was actually going to order more food as their starters seemed very appetizing and were very affordable - their zucchini blossoms ($6) and their foie gras croquemis ($3.50) caught my attention but the waiter told me that I had already enough food in my order, especially since my main course was going to be one of their specials, their lamb shank. Speaking of the lamb shank, it arrived shortly after and was cooked to perfection; it fell of the bone and was perfectly seasoned. That explained why they didn't upgrade my knife at the table while all six others at the table had been given steak knifes. I didn't need a knife at all; it was fork-tender and delicious. It was served on a bed of green lentils and at only $26, was a bargain considering the volume of the serving and the quality of the food. It was cooked confit-style and was had some tomato on top. It was all delicious and ever so tender, even the lentils were cooked perfectly. I could barely finish it all but somehow managed. In the process, I also sampled some of my friends dishes, as I stated earlier, including the duck in a can and the cassoulet. Both were very tasty dishes and the duck was very flavorful, picking up some of the foie gras flavors in the process. We did not have room for desserts but all left very satisfied from our food and drinks - Most of us ordered local beers, including their delicious 'Au Pied de Cochon' ale which is brewed in Quebec. It was light, came ice cold and paired well with our meal. The service and kitchen were a bit slow but the service was very, very efficient and although our meal lasted over two and a half hours, our time spent there was amazing. Our waiter even tracked and split our checks into seven individual tabs at the end of the meal which was both impressive and pretty awesome. Saved us from a math-induced headache.The décor is simple and the restaurant doesn't even have it's name in the front and yet it's warm and welcoming. The tables are a bit cramped and the restaurant isn't very wide, but you're able to use a self-serve coat check upon entering before being showed to your table. This restaurant is an absolute gem in a city which already has good food, it excels at reflecting the true colors of Quebec through its menu and dishes. Just remember though, reservations are a must, and should be done way ahead of time. I cannot wait to go back in the future and experience more of their food.Having read the rave reviews about  Au Pied de Cochon,I had high expectations before I even arrived. I`m pleased to say they weren't only met, they were exceeded! The atmosphere was lovely, the service fantastic and the food incredible. Five stars!To start, my friend and I shared the snails and the salami tray. I have to say the thought of eating snails grossed me out, but I reluctantly tried them. They were delicious. The brandy and BBQ in the sauce made the dish. The salami tray was predictably scrumptious.For my "high gear", I had the duck carpaccio This was possibly the best duck I've ever had. Even if you're not a huge duck  fan, I still think you should try it. The cream sauce drizzled over it was fantastic.I almost forgot to share my cocktail experience. You must get the Pom Pom! It`s got pomegranate juice, ginger and mint, to name a few ingredients. I also tried the Rosemary Pink Diamond Fuzz which was also very good. I had a sip of the Blue Mojito, but it was too sweet for my liking.Simply put, Au Pied de Cochon is superb. I can`t wait to go back.Un resto comme Au Pied de Cochon se passe de présentation. Ouvert depuis 2003 et situé sur la petite avenue Duluth, le restaurant du célèbre Martin Picard s'est bâti une solide réputation, tant au Québec qu'à l'étranger. C'est pour souligner la fin d'une longue session universitaire que nous sommes allés, en groupe, vivre notre baptême du Pied de Cochon.BOUFFEComme d'autres restos de sa trempe, il est difficile d'attribuer un type de cuisine particulier au PDC, mais sachez simplement que le tout tourne autour d'ingrédients locaux...et du cochon.En pleine saison des sucres, un daiquiri à l'érable (11$) était sur le menu ce soir-là; pour ma part, j'ai essayé leur bière maison (5.50$). Légère déception en débutant la soirée; la saveur de l'érable était quasi inexistante dans les daiquiris et la bière était un peu faible à mon goût (une 4% je suppose).Un autre item qui ne figurait pas au menu régulier, la salade de canard (~14$), composée de pommes de terre, d'un œuf et de tous les morceaux imaginables d'un canard.Malgré la modeste portion, la fameuse Poutine au Foie gras (23$) est facilement partageable à quatre Gourmands, tellement c'est riche (gravy au foie gras quand même).Le délicieux melting pot du Pied de Cochon (20.50$), dans lequel on retrouve, entre autres, du boudin et des saucisses.Mon coup de cœur a été la Côte de cochon heureux (25$). Couvert d'oignons et de champignons, la viande est cuite à la perfection et tout simplement délicieuse.Nous commencions tranquillement à être rassasié, mais il y avait encore deux plats en route. Pour prendre une brève pause de cochon, on a également choisi le plat de Poisson du jour de la Nouvelle-Écosse (~36$), servi avec une sauce bien crémeuse, des têtes de violon et des champignons. Comme quoi, il n'y a pas que le porc qui est maitrisé dans la cuisine du PDC.Finalement, on a conclu le festin avec rien de moins que le Pied de Cochon (22$). Caché sous une épaisse peau, on retrouve une chair très savoureuse et tendre. La purée de pomme de terre qui l'accompagne est tout aussi succulente.Malheuresement, on n'avait plus de place pour un dessert, mais ce n'est que partie remise.SERVICE/AMBIANCEÀ l'image de la bouffe qui était servie, le service était impecable. Notre serveur connaissait tous les plats en détail et prenait le temps de nous les expliquer. Le souper s'est étalé sur un bon trois heures, mais en aucun temps on s'est senti pressé, malgré la ligne qui commençait à se former à la porte. Une ambiance assez animée reigne dans le resto et la cuisine semi-ouverte crée un certain charme.Ce qui me plaît aussi du PDC, c'est les prix assez raisonnables des plats principaux. En effet, on a partagé six plats, avec consommations, pour un grand total de ~55$ par personne, ce qui est pas mal moins cher que dans d'autres restos du genre.Notre prochaine visite est cédulée pour le mois prochain et j'en salive déjà !COOL- La bouffe, tout simplement.- Pour ceux qui ne le savent pas, il y a aussi la Cabane à sucre du Pied de Cochon, maintenant ouvert pour la saison des pommes, à l'automne.BOF- Petit bémol sur les drinksReservations were recommendation so I emailed the restaurant. .  . "Good morning, I would like to make dinner reservations for one for Oct 5 if possible.  I will be traveling to Montreal by myself and would love to dine at a place famed for foie gras.  Please let me know what times are available, I can be very flexible but I prefer 8 pm."Response. . ."Hello, Thank you for your reservation request. For how many people would you like to reserve on October 5th ?"Ummmm please do not let this be an indication of how my solo trip is going to be!!!  Is it so strange for a lady to be traveling by herself just because??!?!  I responded, reiterating that I will be traveling by myself and would only need a reservation for one, just me, nobody but me and my independent woman self.I was granted my reservation and marched in a few weeks later.  The reception from the hostess, waiter and everybody at the restaurant was the very definition of welcoming and helpful.  I was seated at the bar next to a couple other single diners with a full view of the kitchen.  The kitchen commotion was a refreshing change from staring at my phone during a meal (the thing was useless anyway since I was out of the country).After a nice discussion with the waiter over my options, we decided that I would enjoy the squid ink pasta with sea urchin (you had me at sea urchin) and the foie gras tout nu.  Both dishes were very rich with generous portions and were absolutely heaven.  I would have licked the plates to pay my compliments to the chef if I was a little bit less inhibited!!  The two appetizers were a bit much for my solo self as I attacked a plate of poutine earlier for lunch.  I was uncomfortably full but gustatorily satisfied.  Note to self - Save precious stomach space next time!!  You are no long a young spring chicken who can finish a whole large pizza in one setting!!  Those days are over!!For my next visit I am eyeing the foie gras cromesquis and the "duck in a can" as recommended by so many reviewers. . . Unless my waiter persuades me to another dish ;-)If there's one place to recommend in Montreal, it will have to be Au Pied de Cochon. Make sure to call weeks ahead for dinner reservations to secure a table. My friend and I winged it and walked-in hoping something was open and sure enough, they had two seats at the bar. We were stoked as we saw the view in front of us. We had the best seats in the house! It's an open kitchen with the entire crew sans Chef Martin Picard, working within an arm's reach. We got to see all the action, interacted with the chefs, and witnessed all the dishes before they got served to all the tables. How awesome is that?We were off to a slow start with our server being so busy with other tables but he got us started with our beers and gave us enough time to figure out what to get. It was a struggle as everything on the menu sounded so decadent. Being from California, the banning of foie gras has made me craving for it. This place has foie in almost all their dishes. Imagine my excitement! Here's what we ended up getting which my dear friend and I all shared:FOIE GRAS CROMESQUIS ($3.50) or croquettes if you will. It's filled with foie gras jus oozing out as you bite into the crisp, deep-fried breading. It was really just a bite to tease us for what's next to come. Then came the GUINEA HEN LIVER MOUSSE ($8). A jar filled to the brim with the mousse accompanied by some orange marmalade and sauerkraut on the side to complement each other. This proved too enticing for me to resist wiping out completely. Ask for extra toast if you run out or use the table bread which by the way, was also hard not to indulge in. Warm, crusty, and fresh from the oven.A special of the evening was their MOULES FRITES ($10). This was not on the menu but we saw lots of these coming out of the kitchen and we just had to order it. For an appetizer, the serving was hefty. The sauce, wow, buttery with bacon bits and a hint of white wine. It was addicting and to dip the bread in it was inevitable until all the white creamy liquid was no more. We had quite a pause until our main course came. We welcomed it and watched the live show in front of us, oohhh'ing and ahhhh'ing as we saw beautiful plates of pig heads, pied de cochons, foie poutines, meatloafs, and ducks in a can pass right in our faces. Finally, the star of the show, STUFFED PIED DE COCHON WITH FOIE GRAS ($45) was laid in front of us. It was ginormous! We were planning on getting an order each initially but bless Chef Audrey's heart for letting us know this was a meal a family can consume. The pig's feet was nicely breaded and laid atop a bed of super creamy mashed potatoes, covered with a stew of mushrooms and onions, then topped with perfectly seared foie gras. Rich, decadent, and seasoned without any apprehension, Chef Martin depicts his true colors on this one amazing plate. Needless to say, the other half had to be packed and eaten the next day. We left completely satiated by the "in your face" flavors on every plate and thankful for the crew that was fun and pleasant. Capping off our Montreal trip at Au Pied de Cochon could not have been any better. Merci beaucoup!For my boyfriend and my final dinner in Montreal, we made reservations at Au Pied de Cochon.We were greeted by a friendly waiter and he went through the specials with us (there were a lot of specials). He described the cold lobster soup ($12) so well, I decided to go with it. We also got oysters (6 for $18) because I love raw oysters. Lastly, we had to get au pied de cohon au foie gras ($45). The waiter was nice enough to tell us that hte au pied de cochon will be enough for the two us and that we shouldn't order any other mains. They also offered us freshly baked bread as we waited for our appetizers and main meal.When we got the cold lobster soup, we were surprised because we didn't hear the waiter mentioning that it was cold. It was quite salty and I didn't catch any lobster flavour in the soup at all.When the oysters came, I was super excited until I saw the size of it. It was quite small considering it was $3 a piece. I could get the same size oyster for cheaper ($1 a piece) at Biff's Bistro in Toronto during their happy hour. Nonetheless, the oysters were delicious and the sauce that it came with went wonderfully together.Lastly was our main meal which took 30 minutes of wait time after finishing our appetizers. The meat fell off the pig's foot. The sauce over the mushrooms was so good. The best part was the mashed potato with cheese melted into it. This restaurant really lived up to its hype on this dish.However, our night sadly went downhill because the waiter was nowhere to be seen. We wanted to see the dessert menu to possibly order more food. However, every time we see him, he'll finish talking to another customer and then walk the opposite direction from where we were sitting. Finally, we decided to get the bill. We finally flagged him down and he didn't get back to us at all. From the end of our main meal to trying to get the dessert menu to us trying to get the bill took over 30 minutes. In the end, it was another person (looks like the manger) who got us the bill.I still give this place four stars. Although the waiter completely failed at serving our table, the food was awesome and the price point wasn't too bad.After much hype, I made it here with a few colleagues on a Wednesday evening. The place was absolutely hopping and hard to get into, but we made a reservation a few weeks in advance.Once inside we sat at the bar, which is by far the best seat in the house. It comes with a direct view of the kitchen and all the goodness the chefs are whipping up. We started out with the ham special for appetizer, which was delicious. It came with a baguette and butter which made it perfect. We then had some poutine, which was also quite good. It was definitely better quality than most poutine dishes. For the main course, I went aggressive and got a mixed bowl consisting of blood sausage, pork sausage, mushrooms and onions sitting on top of mashed potatoes. The dish was very good, but not the amazing experience I was hoping for. Spices could have been a little better, but make no mistake it was a very good dish.With its popular reputation, upbeat atmosphere and good food, this is definitely a place worth visiting when in town. They also have a really good bar with interesting drinks. Great overall experience.Do you love ducks? Or better yet, do you hate ducks? To the point where you'll eat ducks in every form for 3 different dishes? If so, Au Pied de Cochon is just what the doctor ordered.Sure, the name translates to the pig's feet, but the duck is where it's at.Foie gras poutine is about as rich and delicious as it sounds.The duck in a can (which COMES WITH FOIE GRAS) is also a must. Just watching the waiter take a can opener to it and drop it onto a plate is a thing of beauty. The entire can is boiled and then brought out. All the spices are infused and all the fattiness is preserved without getting boiled off. Super unique. Just don't overdo it. One can is probably enough for 3-4 people unless you REALLY want to feel unhealthy.We also got a side of duck fat fries, because WHY THE HELL NOT?There were 8 of us, so we did a few other entrees as well. One was the PDC's cut, which the waiter told us was a boneless pork chop (there was a bone). It looked dry, but it was actually incredibly moist. It was a gigantic hunk of meat too.We also did one of the specials - the Ahi tuna steak for two. Let me tell you, it was NOT for two. Maybe if you fasted and that was the only thing you ate that day. But it was also good. Perfectly rare, with a ton of veggies and cheese on the side. It was probably our least favorite of the dishes, but even still, it was very well done.We were seated all the way in the back by the wine cellar, so it was a bit of a tight squeeze (especially with another large group next to us), but there wasn't much else to complain about. They also have one hell of a wine list.Our waiter was super cool and gave us shots to round out the night.Probably one of the best meals I've ever had. Also, why I came back to the States with none of pants fitting anymore.I went with a southern French person to this restaurant but he did not completely agree with my assessment. Just a caveat. :-)We really wanted to try a Montreal special, as this place is very well known. This place has the famous foie gras poutine and Duck in a Can. We decided to all share to try a few more dishes. The baguette is good!The ambience is nice. We went right when it opened and there was a small line waiting. You cannot get seated if you have not made a reservation. Plan ahead. 1. Garden salad: not on the menu, but we figured we were having so many animal parts this was probably a good idea. $15 for generic salad. The salad was fresh but basic. 2. Mushroom risotto: this dish is very expensive for what it is, but you get a show. They come to your table with a large cheese bowl and add the risotto, mushroom, and even Canadian bacon. This dish had potential but was much too salty. It was hard to finish. 3. Terragon Bison tongue: this is tongue well done. The texture is very soft, which is impressive given the quality of most tongues. The sauces and everything just work well together. However, it's game-y so just be warned. 4. Foie gras poutine: loved it. The fries were good. The gravy was also good. The foie gras was in large blocks and was nice and fatty. I think if you come here, you should get this dish! 5. Duck in a Can: I loved watching them pour half a duck out of a can. Life experience. It even looked nice coming out. The duck came out as a thick filet attached to a flap of lard and also fatty liver (foie gras). I enjoyed this dish very much. It was over puréed cauliflower. The issue I had was that the duck meat was very thick. I had to eat it with slices of the lard to complement the taste. Overall a good dish. 6. Dessert: we got the maple cake and the lemon pie. Both were pretty good. Get the maple cake for novelty sake! Very sweet but good flavors. It was a pricy meal, but for a specialty restaurant it made sense.

Review Text :
Please avoid ordering an omelette here. It looks like a styrofoam frisbee that's been folded in half (stuffed with your favorite diced meats and/or veggies). It tastes like styrofoam too because I don't think they use real eggs (eggs in a carton, fo sho). And the omelettes are steamed...yuck. I have visual evidence posted here for those who doubt me. Other than that, they have decently priced food. The portions are big and you don't leave here still feeling hungry. I went here twice for lunch and I didn't have to wait in line at all. The service is polite, prompt, and accomodating. Overall, this restaurant is a good place to go to eat for convenience (if you're staying at The Palazzo) and decent food.Cheesecake Factory like menu, but much better quality! Apparently it's like Banana Republic to Old Navy but for restaurants. I know it's a chain restaurant so sue me for giving them a 5 star review! There were 7 of us here for dinner so you know the service charge was in effect! Those lucky servers! LOL! I usually stick to a handful of menu items, but you can't really go wrong with anything on the menu. I usually order the crispy caramel chicken, Indochine chicken and shrimp, fish n chips, jambalaya or any of their salads. Their prices are really reasonable too!I happened to order the Southwestern chicken salad which included chicken, lettuce, avocado, black bean, corn, crispy tortilla strips, tomatoes, a few other goodies along with a lime vinaigrette. The salad was super fresh and was really tasty! I always ate here before and will keep doing so as long as the quality of service and food are at this high of a level! I hope that they don't drop in quality like the Cheesecake Factory has in the last few years.Have any of you ever had the feeling where you just can't stand another buffet in Vegas?  Or just simply sick and tired of looking at all the food stations with endless possibilities for a potential food coma? (Well I never had that problem but people in my party certainly had that predicament)  So I guess I will just have to follow suit and take in a regular dining facility instead of the glamorous world of buffet heaven.I've been to a Grand Lux before so it wasn't anything new to me.   It is the sister restaurant of Cheesecake Factory's therefore I have no complaints here at all.  Just like any Cheesecake's you've been to it's got lavish decor, dim lighting, and of course, endless options on their menu.It's a typical California (cheesecake factory) fare where you can pretty much get anything and everything.. so here are the dishes that our party have ordered!Polynesian Salad!  Citrusy flavored dressing with a hint of sweetness all rolled into one drizzled upon a pyramid like salad concoction.  The veggie temple was build with a foundation of mixed greens and tiered off by giant wonton crisps!  It's pretty much the sister version of the Luau Salad at the Cheesecake factory... one of the most delicious salads for a nice sit down restaurant!Grand Cobb Salad:  It's grand but actually not as large portioned as the Polynesian salad.  It's got all your typical culprits in a cobb (avocado, bacon, turkey, egg whites, etc..) All dressed in bleu cheese!  (I thought it was ranch..  Yuck!  I hate Blue Cheese!!!  However, when I actually gave it a try, the dressing as actually tasty and bearable!  (I simply cannot handle bleu cheese) So that's actually tasty as well!Madeira Chicken:  Didn't get to try this out but according to our friends, it was tasty!  (I'm not a big chicken breast dish kind of guy so I never order these things)  I'll just take their word for it!Spicy Flat Bread Chicken Sandwich:  Same as above as I didn't get to try the sammy, but it was gone from my buddy's plate so that's a good sign!  Gotta try that next time!Slow Roasted Short Ribs of Beef:  Great BBQ flavor!  It's your typical BBQ flavor dish but definitely tasty!  (With BBQ you really cannot go wrong unless you overcook it which will make it super dry and gross)  But it was nicely flavored, juicy, and delicious overall!  (huge portion too! as it was served with veggies and mash Potato!)Fried Calamari:  Highlight alert!  This is one of the best Calamari that I've ever had in many different places!  They fried their calamari along with veggies and rock shrimp to create the most heavenly dish (one of my all time favorites!) served with ranch and spicy aioli dressing!  I'm telling you, if you were to pick one dish to get at Grand Lux, this one is highly highly recommended!  Oh... did I mention the portion for this is huge?  Well you bet it is!  Totally worth every penny!Lastly, service was awesome as it comes to expected being affiliated with cheesecake Factory.  They brought out wrong salad dressing for me and when I asked for it, 2 different wait staff came out with the dressing!  (Now I got 3!)  Great attention to customer's needs is definitely a plus!So there you have it, Grand Lux Cafe, opens 24 hrs, in Venetian or Palazzo, and will serve your morning, noon, dinner, or late night dining needs in case you are totally turned off by the buffets of  Vegas!  A terrific alternative yet decently priced!Almost 3 am on a saturday (technically sunday morning) AND THEY'RE STILL OPEN, HORRAY.. yeah i know I'm lame for coming back from the club so early!.. but after 3 am this palazzo location wont let you in SO you'll have to try the venetian location which opens laterCOMPLIMENTARY sour dough bread as you sit and wait... though its nothing spectacularFOOD CAME OUT FAST.. although time may have been flying by faster in my somewhat intoxicated mind..---short rib grilled cheese was pretty TASTY---ahi tuna burger was yummy too (but i'd definitely get the short rib sammie over this one!) the waiter was really nice & accommodating! he never rushed us even though we got in just before closing!Checked this 24/7 place out after arriving in Vegas late Friday night. Came in at about 3:30AM and was surrounded by lots of exhausted barefoot clubbers with heels in tow. From what I remember, we were seated promptly and greeted by a friendly waitress. I wanted a Long Island Iced Tea, but was instructed that "Texas Tea" was an ample substitute, and that it had "spurs". Intrigued by the spurs, and wondering if they would kick my night in the right direction, I decided to order one.  I was a little disappointed, as It tasted like sweetened Nestea with a splash of vodka and lemon.  I sent it back, and ordered a more appropriate vodka martini with 3 giant olives.  Excellent.  I also ordered the seared tuna which was excellent.  I don't really recall how much everything was, but I do remember the sun was up when we left later that "night".One of my faaaaaaaavs!!Their hamburger melt is to fackin' die for..oh mah gahd. Delicious crunchy fries, and good ranch. I'm a ranch fiend..and always love me a good tasting ranch. It's even delicious when it's cold. Haha.Shopping can be so exhausting at the Palazzo. I know....life is tough.There are a plethora of places to sit down and eat. Actually it is quite overwhelming to pick a place. Something persuaded me to enter the Grand Luxe Cafe.  I was not too thrilled at first because I've been to one at Beverly Center (back home in LA). It was late morning and I had left my friends at the hotel to venture off on my own. With that said I didn't need to wait in line like the rest of the folks, I got seated right away at the counter in the bar area. My server's name was Chris (he remembered me when I visited again the second time a month later). We had a few great conversations and I even chatted with the folks who sat next to me. I love breakfast so I opted for just plain old eggs and toast. Then I wanted orange juice.....just a little kicked up.....got myself a Clementine Crush (Clementine Orange Vodka and Cointreau Shaken with Fresh Orange, Lime, Passion Fruit and Pineapple Juice). Let me tell you, that drink was the perfect way to start my morning at Vegas. It was so freakin' good even my neighbor got the same order. Maybe it's the way Chris makes it....who knows.....but this shit is good. I was a little tipsy so had to stay a little bit longer than I expected, lol.The service is outstanding. The atmosphere is relaxing. And the Clementine Crush is to die for. And yes I came back here again for breakfast a few months later.I hate writing 3 star reviews, they are the most boring.  I am usually too lazy to write them to be honest.  Nothing was that great, nothing was that bad, just a forgettable meal.  The Grand Lux Cafe at the Palazzo was just that for me.  Came here for breakfast because we wanted to stay close to the hotel.  After looking at a very uninspired breakfast buffet, we ordered off the menu.I ordered "The Best Eggs Benedict".  Really, that's what it's called on the menu.  I would like them to change the name to  "Not the Worst Eggs Benedict".  Eggs were poached nicely, but the ham wasn't anything special.  A big slab of Louis Rich quality ham.  The english muffin was a pretty large compared to the poached egg.  It wasn't very toasted and thus got soggy underneath a pile of hollandaise sauce.  Way too much sauce going on here.  Fortunately it came with a side of hash browns to soak up all the sauce.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/grand-lux-cafe-las-vegas-5?start=300#4xIDFoFkv-erhPe8JFuqfwThe wife had the DeLux Breakfast Sandwich, which came with scrambled eggs, ham, bacon, grilled tomato, and havarti cheese.  I didn't try any of it, but she just kind of shrugged her shoulders when I asked how it was. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/grand-lux-cafe-las-vegas-5?start=300#Jst4brxUtnAHaajwiebEDQMy brother also wasn't impressed with his Huevos Rancheros.  Fried eggs on top of corn tortillas, black beans, sautéed peppers and onions, with cheddar cheese topped with "spicy" ranchero sauce.  His biggest problem was that the ranchero sauce had no spice at all, in fact the whole dish was quite flavorless even though it looked nice.  He salvaged his breakfast with the help of tabasco sauce.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/grand-lux-cafe-las-vegas-5?start=300#Rmtzr49KIb2JE_Mev2HcGgThe only hit were the breakfast beignets.  These were excellent.  This might have been the first time having a beignet, where I haven't thought, if only I were at the Cafe du Monde in New Orleans.  So often places try to do a knock off of those, but these seemed to be their own thing.  They were piping hot right out of the fryer with just a small amount of powdered sugar on them.  I'm normally a purest and want my beignets with lots of sugar and that's it, but these were served with 4 dipping sauces.  Lots of sugar would have gotten in the way here for dipping. My favorite sauce was sweet milk based, like a more liquid bavarian cream.  The raspberry sauce was also excellent.  Mixing the two sauces even better.  There was also a chocolate sauce and a cinnamon sugar based sauce.  There were at least 8 or 9 beignets in the basket, perfect for sharing.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/grand-lux-cafe-las-vegas-5?start=300#pd2HMS9A30TXlwNFPRAXxwIf it's breakfast time, I would come back for beignets for sure and some coffee, but that's about it.  Not sure about lunch or dinner, you'll have to read other people's reviews on that.I heart the Grand Lux whether it's here at the Polazzo or Venetian - the food is yummy and satisfying. The restaurant opens early so I arrived for breakfast on a Friday.  Parking is convenient if you park by the casino elevator and is a near walk to the restaurant. I was seated asap and was greeted by my friendly waitress who brought me hot coffee. The bfast menu is large but I was craving a Mexican entree and went with the huevos rancheros - two eggs over medium, black beans, bell peppers and purple onions over crisp corn tortillas & topped with a zesty green salsa. The entree hit the spot and cured my Mexican food caving.Overall another nice experience at the Grand Lux.Every time I come to the Grand Lux Cafe, I always order the same thing: the Grand Lux Burger Melt.  It's full of grease, cheese, meat, and I LOVE IT.  The burger melt is extremely cheesy with cheese not only inside the burger, but also melted onto the bread.  There's usually a wait during lunchtime and dinnertime, but we try to stagger our meals when in Vegas to avoid the crowds.We arrived at around 3:00PM on a Thursday, and although we were seated immediately, it took a while to receive our food.  The food is worth the wait.  The fries were crispy, the burger was delicious, and the side of ranch had a little spicy kick to it.  Their strawberry lemonade is the bees knees (especially in the 105 degree, hot, dry, Vegas weather).Our waitress was attentive, and refilled our drinks before they were empty.  I've always been familiar with the Grand Lux Cafe in the Venetian, however the Palazzo's cafe was equally as good in both service and quality of food.  Will definitely visit again!4 1/2 stars. I came in for breakfast since I know how consistent this place is. Park in the underground parking next to the casino elevator for easy access to this Grand Lux.I arrived later then normal for bfast and there was a line 8 deep during the week. I passed on the buffet and selected the ham and eggs. The ham steak was yummy and contained just the right amount of fat on the outside of the steak to give it an awesome flavor. The potatoes, scrambled eggs and English muffin were all excellent also.My waitress was friendly and attentive and must say - I've never had a negative experience at the Grand Lux Cafe.Found this place in the Palazzo when we were looking for a place close by Wynn that wasn't too expensive and yet not food court food.Originally ordered the Maui Rib Eye ($28), but it came out well-done instead of medium rare... Non-edible.  Since they were going to make a new one, I opted for the regular Rib Eye Steak. The Maui Rib Eye was too sweet for me, and took away all the meat flavors. The flavor of the regular Rib Eye was just perfect. I opted for a side of Asparagus instead of a baked potato.Great service! The waitress took one look at my well-done steak and offered to bring me one that was prepared right.Medicore for breakfast. The buffet was pretty pathetic looking, especially considering this is Vegas, land of the endless buffets with all you can eat lobster and pancakes (yes together and yes it's weird). I've seen better breakfast buffets in LA. We decided to just order. My fiance ordered an omelette and I ordered cereal. It took forever to get our food and when it arrived it wasn't anything special. Almost everything on the breakfast menu seemed heavy. The only reason we ate here was because we had the breakfast credit from American Express, but honestly, next time I'd rather pay for breakfast and go somewhere decent.My gf and I returned to Las Vegas Cafe for our second trip. We had eaten here once before and enjoyed the meal. This trip we ate here 3 times because we found that the restaurant really lives up to its guidelines of fresh ingredients, extensive menu, and good prices.The restaurant is very large, seats up to 728 people, but is divided into 3 areas: street cafe, bar area and main dining room, and the main dining room has a high ceiling, but is well designed so not truly "noisy". They do designate non-smoking areas, which seems to help. It is owned and run by the Cheesecake Factory, but is elegant in its design. Although I have not been to the Cheesecake Factory, it is my understanding that the menu is rather different than that of the Factory.It is located on the same floor as the casino in the Venetian and is open 24/7. There is a breakfast menu, lunch dinner menu, and late night menu, the latter which, for obvious reasons, is smaller than the main menu, but still quite good.The portions are substantial, so we were able to order one salad and one entree and split them and feel adequately fed. The ingredients were extremely fresh and flavors were understated.I consider this restaurant a true gem of a find in Las Vegas.So I remember going to this place a long time ago and thought it was only okay, but my friend convinced me that it was yummy and that I should return.This location had no wait on a sunday afternoon and we were seated right away in the corner of the restaurant. Although we were tucked away in the back corner, the server did not forget about us and attended to us immediately. WARNING: portions are big! The three of us ordered three appetizers and three entrees... lets just say we were extremely full and food coma-ing for awhile.. Appetizers:Asian Nachos- Who even thinks of this stuff! crispy wonton chips with chicken, wasabi cream, cheese, and sweet hot peanut sauce with fried rice in the middle. I don't know if these were made for asians or something but damn were these good! The slight hint of wasabi cream really added to the nachos, and adding the fried rice on top of the chip was super asian and delicious.Brie Wonton with creamy brie cheese, fresh pineapple, and caramelized onion marmalade- this was okay, i expected better. I didn't taste the pineapple in the wonton, and they left the rind on the brie so the taste was kind of bitter. Sauce was good.Crispy Pepperoni Mini Pizza- they added parmesan slices on top which really added to the pizza in terms of texture and and flavor. Other than that, regular pepperoni pizza.Entrees:Lunch special salad and pasta carbonara- the pasta was bomb. Yeah you can make pasta at home but the bacon bits, chicken and cheese was super flavorful and tasty. The noodles were also cooked well. Housemade Pierogies- Pierogies are basically potato dumplings which they made by hand, and they added roasted short rib with mushrooms and onions. Yum. Yeah pierogies are plain and heavy and basic, but it's good comfort food and perfect after a long night. Avocado Chipotle Cheeseburger- this thing was giant. I asked for medium rare and mushrooms instead of peppers, and it was a giant stacked burger. The cheese was melted all over the place (perfectly) and the meat was cooked the way I wanted it. The avocados were chopped (I expected it to be in slices) and it kept falling all over the place. Really messy dish, but good burger and good fries. Overall this restaurant is perfect as a heavy lunch or dinner. Definitely exceeded my expectations from what I had last time (which I don't really remember). Total came out to be $71, which is pretty fair as we did order a lot of food.. Would definitely come if staying at Palazzo or Venetian after a long night.You can NEVER go wrong with Grand Lux Cafe. Morning, Afternoon and Night I could have this place. I love the food! The portions are hugeee and just delicious! We ordered red velvet pancakes one morning omg I couldn't even eat the whole thing, they were beyond amazing especially with the cream cheese frosting, drooool!  The omelette was good however we have had better and the hashbrowns were average, you even get toast and a bagel.  Another day we ordered the chicken jambalaya with noodles, damn they were good a bit on the salty side but delicious.  This is an absolute must for me every time I'm in Vegas.***Grand Lux Cafe is conveniently located on the casino floor at The Venetian/Palazzo; their brunch menu is priced similarly to Las Vegas 24-hour cafes; I did a build-your-own omelette, which consisted of bacon, cheddar cheese, onion, and assorted peppers (you have the option to add up to 4 ingredients); the omelette was good (nicely cooked and all of the ingredients worked well together); the omelette came with crispy shredded hash browns and good and hearty wheat toast (a toasted English muffin is available as an alternative to the toast); the brunch was decent and filling; you can get a more upscale and more delicious brunch at Bouchon (also located at this hotel), but that restaurant is harder to get to, not as filling and more expensive***Like almost all of the major resort hotels on The Strip, The Venetian and Palazzo offer complimentary self and valet parking.When in Vegas, I always make a trip to Grand Lux and only eat one thing of theirs: the Zen Noodles. Yes it's totally a rip off ($15) spin of "pho" and also pretty white washed version of pho. But I like it! The broth is lemongrass flavored (not beef) and they use chicken. You add bean sprouts and spinach and ask for sriracha and you just made yourself a healthy pho! The broth is sour so don't expect a beef flavored. And you don't really need sriracha but I love it spicy. It's a really good spin on pho. My GFs and I always get this late at night! Since grand Lux is open 24 hours, we eat here after clubbing. You don't know how many times zen noodles saved me from a nasty hangover!

After a second visit I am revising down to 2.25 stars.  They do chicken dishes pretty well but we have been disappointed in other things.  And their spicy is not very spicy.  I added hot oil to my spicy garlic shrimp.  I actually dipped my shrimp into the side of hot oil I requested.  That got 'er done.I almost requested chopsticks so that I could repeatedly jam them in my ears and stop hearing the brutal Muzak renditions of such songs as "Yesterday" and "I Started a Joke".  My daughter even piped up with, "Dad, this music is really, really bad.  What is it?"

Review Text :
As an Old Laveener, (even though i'm only 24 - I'm still old!) it's crazy to see fields develop into something different. For the longest there used to be field worker selling their surplus crops and now - there is a strip mall where a field used to be... and on the North East corner of said field is new and huge Jumbo Buffet.I first went to Jumbo Buffet during their grand opening. We entered into their brand spanking new place and saw a very clean and kinda tacky dining room. I gotta admit - I think it's kinda cute... but just kinda. But what I do like is their GIGANTIC plasma hung high in their dining room. It's on, but it's muted and you don't notice it unless you're looking for it, despite it's size. They have uniformed and friendly enough staff. But many things get lost in translation.I thought they had decent food - nothing great, but decent. They have a HUGE variet of food that attempts to be better than the run of the mill chinese buffet however - because there's so many dishes the cooks really can't concentrate on the dishes they do put out. So subpar all around. It was crazy busy which is to be expected however - we were frustrated with our server who had trouble understanding us and getting our drinks refilled was an uphill battle. One funny thing is that the buffet features a very well maintained Mongolian BBQ and someone asked for a hot dog! yes, a hot dog!! What was even MORE odd was that they had it!! lol! Pretty soon everyone was devouring hot dogs! Recently, I ventured back to Jumbo Buffet. I was disappointed to see that they raised their prices to $11 a person. and their American food was slipping. No longer were their roasted potatos and onions were these light crispy chunks of goodness - now they were oily and oniony hunks of mashiness - blech. The sushi is just as mediorcure as it was the first time I went. However, their salmon maki was decent. Their soups - I wouldn't trust their soups 'nuff said. The sweet & sour chicken was the biggest disappointment - the first time I went it was fresh and yummy, this last time - it was dense and hard! and it hurt my teeth to bite into it! ouch! What did stay good were their many seafood selections, the octupus still scared the crap out of lil kids, their fried shrimp was still good as were their crispy egg rolls. The Mongolian BBQ is still well maintained and thankfully everything was at a nice cold temperature! Their orange chicken was yummy! and or COURSE, the hot dogs still stole the show!! I would like to suggest to the owners of Jumbo Buffet that they close the smaller dining room that is obviously a different "store" within the strip mall and rennovate it into a hotdog place... and if they were to bring back the old Potato & Onions dish, in place of fries - that would kick ASS!!Came by for dinner buffet last Friday- paid $11 plus tax.  Beware, if you order anything else but water to drink, you will be charged at least $1.50 for it!  I arrived sometime around 4p, so I wasn't sure I'd be charged for lunch or dinner.  I'd already visited the buffet line twice when I noticed there weren't any crabs to be found; I was told that they were still cooking.  I'm guessing that the crabs were placed in the buffet line around 4:45p.LOVED the frog legs!  These will be one of the first I will sweep up on my next visit!  I also enjoyed the baked mussels, salmon, roasted cinnamon sweet potatoes, Chinese-bbq'ed pork (from the grill), and five-spiced crab.  I also spotted crab legs, but thought I'd save those for my next visit.  I also adored the steamed buns (the differing textures of the buns were perfect!) with red mung bean inside, and especially the lilyleaf-wrapped sticky rice and red beans (for my sweet-tooth)!!  There weren't many when I saw them (there were only two, actually), and despite my inquiring for more, none were brought out.Liked the omelet-topped sushi.  Coudn't try the others as they contained allergens.  Tried the sashimi, even though they still looked and felt frozen.  I ended up trashing these.  I took a few pieces of octopus to the table and liked the two bites I had before sitting down.  However, after having a few bites of the other food samples, I went back to the octopus pcs. and it felt like I was chewing on leather, and the taste wasn't that far-off from leather, either.  Even though I had my fill of sweets with the red mungbean buns and sticky rice, I had to try the soft-serve ice cream.  JB needs to enlarge their toppings area- I ran out of oreo cookie bits!  I didn't try it, but I spotted a great-looking strawberry-rhubarb pie...Now in the culinary wasteland that is Laveen, we decided to give the Jumbo Buffet a try. Never again. Very few food items were up to temperature, which explains my digestive distress later on. The sushi was sketchy looking and tasted old. The meat was either dried out or fatty. The steak on the Mongolian BBQ looked as if it had been there a week. The ice milk was hard and the other desserts were all pre-packaged and virtually flavorless. This buffet is an epic fail in my opinion.

I came here with my Sunday date guy, and I had a good time.  It was late, and we wanted something simple.  We ended up coming here because it was open, and neither of us had been here before.I liked the fact that Sunday, from 4-10 is half off everything!  The entire menu!!!  We had a great meal there, and it cost us $14.50.  Loved it!

I think perhaps fast food chicken places hire the most stupid of all employees available to the fast food industry.We have stopped here a few times to pick up food and eat it at home. Not once have we gotten what we ordered. Ok I am sure now you are thinking I must be the most stupid of customer for not checking before I leave. Well yeah I agree with you. But this last time we ordered 12 pieces, I did look in the bag to see that all that we ordered was there. I did not take the chicken out to count it, we got eight pieces. Gus called to complain and all they said was, what am I supposed to do about it? So I will answer that question now, Nothing do nothing and I will wise up and just bypass your store from now on.

Review Text :
I have driven by MezzaNotte many times, brick oven pizza just doesn't make me wanna stop, but someone said that MN was really good, so I filed it in my little restaurant Rolodex mind. Today driving aimlessly thinking where should I stop for lunch, decided to give it a whirl.Sat at the bar, looked at the $8.95 express lunch  menu, get this. Choice of soup or two salads, slice of pepperoni or cheese pizza and then four or five main courses and TEA! nine bucks. Can I get a hell yeah?Service was ok, my waiter, well, um, let's just say, "he's just not that into me." It was pretty funny, he was pleasant enough, but very indifferent.  Which, hey, I don't care, as long as I have everything I need I'm fine. I ordered the arugula salad, cheese pizza and chicken marsala. The salad and the cheese pizza were hitting the spot and I hadn't even had the chicken yet. The chicken marsala didn't have any mushrooms or a starch. It was chicken on a plate. It was good, not very marsalally, but good.I enjoyed my lunch today and I thought it was a great value. One of the best  greetings is the olive oil white beans with crusty bread. That alone is worth the trip.Can't wait to go back and see my BFF at the bar.

Back and better than ever! How do you take an already solid place and make it more remarkable?A new sleek space. New furniture! New paint!Stunning... I'm talking stunning stainless steel!A really cool storefront that's a bajillion times better than the old. But what hasn't changed? Still (in my opinion) the most authentic Mexican joint we have in Madison. It's meat on a corn tortilla. With some pico and cilantro. That's what I ate for 7 years, I'm thrilled to keep the tradition alive, and I haven't found anything better in the 608. (People try though... why does everyone want to convince me to keep looking?)TG has risen from the ashes and spread it's wings. New front room, bigger kitchen but same good stuff. Try a bunch of tacos ($2) and a couple of sopes (a $3 pile of awesome) if you like but the steak Platillo Guadalajara ($10) is my favorite. Wash it down with a couple of Negra Modelos and walk away a fan muy contento.5 stars for the chimichanga alone. HUGE portions (woohoo leftovers for lunch tomorrow) It's your basic Mexican restaurant décor. The food is served fast and the margaritas are to die for. Only regret I didn't order fried ice creamGod bless this restaurant. I thought good Mexican food didn't exist in Madison...then I realised I was talking to people who thought a to-remain-nameless local tex mex chain was "pretty great" "Mexican" "food." and then I found Taqueria Guadalajara, and my life hasn't been the same since. They have super friendly and fast service, insanely good prices, cute decor, and amaaaaazing food. They are super busy on weekends so prepare for a wait but it will be worth it! Try the pozole, available only on weekends. It's incredibly soothing and satisfying, the perfect cold weather and/or hangover cure. They also have the best horchata in town. Taqueria Guadalajara forever!!!!

Review Text :
Le Pegase is perfect for a romantic date, or even a family gathering. This French restaurant sits on a quiet Mont Royal street, with little to call attention to itself save for the pegasus on its sign.Everything we tasted satisfied, from the duck confit salad - drizzled with a lovely balsamic vinaigrette - to the duck with orange zest (C$40 total), the tender meat[1] done in a homey preparation. Pacing was ideal[2]: in-between courses we enjoyed the bottles of vino we toted in."Merci bien" to the friendly, accommodating service.[1] What can I say? I love duck.[2] Seriously, when can I come here again?

Restaurant name  Via Brasil Steakhouse

Review Text :
I was recently having a conversation with some people about this place. For some reason, we were also talking about Groupons. I said that if a Groupon ever came up for Via Brasil, I'm jumping on it. Lo and behold, a Groupon appears days later. It was a sign.I'm pretty sure Via Brasil takes up the space that was formerly (and quite briefly) a Makino's. It's a nice, large, and elegantly decorated restaurant. As soon as you step inside, you know you're in for a culinary treat.After you're seated, they explain the red/green system - green of course meaning that you're ready for meat! My card stayed green for most of the night. To put it succinctly, Via Brasil serves up some of the most amazing cuts of meat I've ever eaten. Sure there were some items that weren't quite up to par, but most of it was absolutely awesome. To be honest, it's all quite a blur. They just kept coming and coming and coming. And I just kept saying yes yes yes!Surprisingly, I didn't enjoy the bacon-wrapped tenderloin that much. It was the weirdest and most unexpected thing. I actually thought the bacon got in the way of the flavor! On the other end of the spectrum, the last cut I received was some sort of garlic-infused meat. Looking at their web site, I think it is the "Noble Cut of Picanha in Garlic." Wow. I was full by that point, but that didn't stop me from getting a second cut. It was the perfect ending.If I ever go back, I think I know what strategy I would employ. I noticed that the cuts of meat I enjoyed most were light and very much on the rare side. The cuts I didn't enjoy as much tended to be dense, which caused them to be not as tender and way more filling.Oh I should mention the salad bar. You might think one would ignore it. The reality is, you need something on your plate to balance out that meat. It's really much more than just a salad bar and the choices are mostly delicious, but definitely use that only as a complement to the meat. You are here for the meat!One thing I didn't realize is that dessert is not included. I couldn't resist getting some of their Tiramisu. It was pretty good, but not sure it was worth the extra $8. I know it's a silly thing to mention since the Rodizio meal is $43, but it's good to know.OK this is long enough. Way too long. FOUR STARS!Wow!  What a great meal! The waiter comes to your table with a bread basket with several doughnut hole shaped buns.  They are Brazilian cheese buns dusted with parmesan cheese.  There were excellent!I started with the salad bar and took items sparingly.  I tried the cold, sliced portabello muchrooms, one tomato caprese, asparagus risotto, two small artichoke heart halves, and two large shrimps and a piece of fish from their hot seafood mixture.  This was the extent of my salad bar foray as I didn't want to fill up on salad.  It would be a great dinner in itself.I turned the coaster to the green side meaning bring on the meat.  Before they started that, a waiter brought three dishes to the table - one with 3 fried plantains, another with mashed potatoes, and a third with green beans with garlic.  These were my vegetables to go with my meat.  A lot of food to accompany a lot of food.I didn't try all the meats as I was filling up before they had a chance to bring everything to my table.  I liked the small sausage, the first meat I tasted and it was excellent.  Beautiful seasoning.  Then I had two thin slices of rare prime rib which was excellent also.  I had both the chicken breast wrapped in bacon and the tenderloin wrapped in bacon.  Both were very good.  The seasonings were perfect.  I am a salt user extraordinaire, but I salted nothing except the mashed potatoes and green beans.  I had the garlic picanha (top sirloin) and it was superb!!  I also had one slice of beef rib which is sliced from a rack of rib (large--not baby back) and served on a separate small plate. Since there were only two tables occupied in the restaurant, there weren't several guys walking around distributing meat like rodizio restaurants.  Two guys were tasked with the serving.  I didn't get the pork loin and I forgot Tony's mentioning of chicken hearts--damn, damn, damn.  Well, something to look forward to next time.After all this, I did hold back so I could try some dessert.  I had a slice of peanut butter, chocolate chip cheesecake.  Oh yeah--great!Service was impecable.  My iced tea was refilled often, staff was always around to answer questions or see if you needed something.  I was greeted at the door by a delightful young lady and she also bid me a kind, smiling farewell!The place is very nicely done.  I love the wine rack that goes almost to the ceiling.  I could see the super ladder inside to extend and reach the highest shelves.This is a great deal with a Groupon.  The Groupon was $21.  The regular price for the rodizio is $42.95.  I'm not sure I'd be back for the full price, but the Groupon certainly makes it a great deal.  Come on Groupon--let's get anohter Via Brasil.  And you know, I'll probably go back and pay the full price if one of my friends from out of town who loves rodizio comes to Las Vegas.  We'll go together!My husband made a reservation for the family on Friday night for 7:30.  We had a groupon and wanted to use it, so that was the biggest incentive, plus payday meant I had money to spend.  The long week at work also meant I was ready to relax and eat good food.Walked in and our table was ready.  The service was amazing!  Since it was our first time, we had to learn a little about the process.  Everyone was very attentive to us all.  We got clean plates every so often, and water was refilled before it ran out.The food was delicious.  My 3 year old could not get enough.  The salad bar had risotto, salad, seafood, mushrooms, rice, and other inviting items.  There were also side dishes you could order.  We got fries for the kids, and asparagus and collard greens for hubby and I.  Then came the meat!  When I turned my card over to green, the servings came nonstop!  There was skirt steak, top sirloin, pork rib, beef rib, prime rib, bacon wrapped turkey, bacon wrapped beef tenderloin, pork tenderloin, chicken legs, frog legs, my  favorite corn, and I don't remember what else.  By the end of dinner, my 3 year old kept asking for more steak!  They brought some out just for him.  For dessert, we had the creme brulee.  It was a huge portion that all of us could share.  It was nice and creamy, not to sweet and was a nice finish to a fantastic dinner.For all four of us, our bill with the groupon came out to 73 and change.  I tipped 20.  The pricing is great especially since the kids are free.  I definitely think it is worth the money.  If you want to go to Via Brasil, but are on the fence or think that it is a lot to spend, I would say GO GO GO.This review is for my visit for Brunch, only available on Sunday! Rodizio style baby!Brunch is 24.99 pp normally however I joined the on line e-club for free and was immediately sent via email an invite for 19.99 pp, hell yeah! FYI kids under 5 eat free. All you can eat/AYCE!Wow, I came across this restaurant and brunch info by accident while browsing the web and I am sure glad I did!The description of the brunch was mouth watering and I have been dreaming of going for four weeks now, was just waiting for a Sunday that my boyfriend did not work.Complimentary drinks, fresh squeezed pineapple, strawberry and orange juice are available for $3.50 per glass.They have a beautiful super fresh hot and cold Gourmet salad bar, that includes lobster bisque soup, bacon, sausage, hashed browns, cheese blintz,  and many homemade salads and a delicious ranch dressing! I really enjoyed the Caprese salad mmm yum and they have bottles of the best Olive oils around that you can use. My boyfriend really enjoyed the roasted peppers and eggplant. This is just listing a few as they have close to 35 items in their hot and cold gourmet salad bar!Fresh omelet station, eggs benedict or eggs any style for your own creation made to order, and Belgium waffles made fresh as well!You are given a rodizio marker for your table and when you want meat brought to your table you place it on the green side, and when you have had enough or are working on what you have then you flip it over to the red and they will not come to your table.Mmmm yum they also give you a side of fresh mashed potatoes and some delicious fried bananas which were the best I have ever had in my life!!!!!!They have a cart of fresh banana bread and another bread,  however once she said banana I knew I must have and did not hear what the other was. It was the best banana bread I have ever had the pleasure of eating! I had seconds on that for sure!The brunch is rodizio style so there are 6 choices of meats coming around at all times to make the rounds to your table. They are generous and are constantly on the move making sure you are satisfied and have everything you need or could ever want! List of meats cut table side. Top sirloin, tenderloin wrapped in bacon, turkey wrapped in bacon, prime rib, chicken drumsticks, smoked ham and pineapple. Keep in mind this selection is only for brunch, their dinner service has closer to 16 meats. The bacon wrapped turkey was an explosion of flavor all up in my mouth! The prime rib was delicious and melted in my mouth like butta!The service was Amazing, everyone on staff catering to our every need, refills of iced tea galore, my glass never even had the chance to get half full at any point! They cleared plates, brought plates, folded our napkins back up every time we left the table, they were on it! This restaurant for sure values and appreciates their customers!Heather was an Amazing Server by the way, her smile and sweet, helpful, knowledgeable personality was refreshing. If I owned a restaurant I would love to have her on my staff!This was a real treat for my sweetie and I also was my first time for rodizio style meat service it sure was a winner!We will be back because I know I will be dreaming about this place and be itching to get back really soon!The best service ever in all of my dining experiences I swear! I told my boyfriend that I feel like a Queen totally treated like royalty in every way! They totally spoiled us with anything and everything, I am still Amazed and super happy with our experience. Top quality food and very tasty and creative!You know, they say when someone likes your business, they'll tell 1 person, but if they don't like it, they'll tell 10.  I've been going to Via Brasil for almost a year, and I've loved it until recently.  I still love the Rodizio Dinner, which is expensive but comparable to other Brazilian steakhouses, and the food is delicious.I turned several of my friends on to VB as a go-to happy hour spot.  They used to have a bartender/server named Jules who was AMAZING - orders were quick, accurate, she was witty and attractive (which my single friends appreciated). We would go weekly, or at least a couple times a month.Sadly, I went back three times over the past two weeks, and was informed by the hostess that Jules was no longer there, and their service has plummeted.  The first of the three most recent visits involved delayed drinks, arguments with wait staff about how to split cash and credit card payments on the bill (which are usually over $250 with 6-8 people), and delayed food orders.The 2nd of the last three visits, the same delays occurred.  The waiter tried to blame the kitchen, but when I asked about why my bruschetta (which takes all of 60 seconds or less to throw together) wasn't out after 30 minutes and the rest of my party was leaving, the waiter acknowledged he forgot to put the order in.  THEN, he puts the order in and rather than comp. the order, he charges the full price rather than happy hour price BECAUSE HE FORGOT TO PUT IN THE ORDER before happy hour ended!The last time I went will be the last time I go for happy hour.  I went with two other people.  One of my friend's orders was completely forgotten.  We had trouble getting anyone's attention for new drinks. And, we waited, after we finished our food and drinks, 30 minutes until one of us went to the bar to get our tab for our table.  Then, after another 10 minutes, we ended up having to bring the signed check back to the bar because we'd basically been abandoned at that point.I loved this place...LOVED. My friends made fun of me because I'd always recommend it.  Unfortunately, the service at happy hour has so plummeted that it's not even worth it.  Too many good happy hours to waste time here. Bring back Jules!My hubby has a birthday coming up and he wants Texas de Brazil for his special dinner. Since we had been to TDB before, and not tried Via Brasil even though it is in our area, I figured we could give it a shot. I did have an A-OK experience, but I am glad it wasn't his actual birthday dinner or I would have been disappointed we didn't go to TDB. The "Rodizio" dinner is priced at $45.99 per person. A 50 plus item salad bar is included, and you get to try 18 different meats that meat carvers bring to your table on skewers. You can choose if you want what they have and how much. If pink meat isn't your thing, you can request any of the meat be cooked to to your liking. They give each person there own round paper disc that you turn to green when you are ready for more meat and then you turn it to red until you are ready for more or are simply done eating. I was impressed by the fact that the side dishes were included with the meal. They had like 16 to choose from and you can pick as many as you like. That is a nice touch! They ask that you tell them your sides when you first get there so they can start preparing them. So I am not a vegetarian at all, but I don't eat a whole lot of meat. Tonight was my night to shine as the carnivore I am not. I absolutely succeeded! I first went to the salad bar. I wasn't impressed. There were a lot a seafood options which is great, but not for someone like me who doesn't eat seafood. I didn't feel there was a lot of options for a salad however the veggies they did offer were fresh and delicious. I put some "Caprese Salad" on my plate and that was actually very good. As we finished up our salad, the sides we ordered arrived. The "White Rice" paired nicely with the "Sauteed Mushrooms" and the "Fried Banana" was good. Then the meats started coming! I have to admit that the "Top Sirloin" known as "Pichana" that they claim is the star of the meal was not good at all. The meat was tough and flavorless. The "NY Strip", and "Prime Rib" were the same, tough meat and flavorless. Then came the "Bacon Wrapped Turkey" and THAT is delicious. I'm a huge fan of bacon and the bacon really added a nice flavor to the turkey. Then came the "Garlic Filet and "Bacon Wrapped Filet and these two are the star of the meal to me. The filet was so tender and flavorful. I like my meat cooked well done so the server took note of that and made sure to bring me pieces with no pink. I liked my meal, but can't see coming back and paying full price again. Maybe if it were a deal they had going on or something. The meat at first was not good, and the salad bar was not great. I know this isn't TDB, but I do have to compare it because they both have the "churrascaria" thing going on. And the salad bar at TDB is worth just eating that alone. The sides were decent, but I only enjoyed a few types of the meat so I'd rather spend the extra to have TDB. There is a Happy Hour here at Via Brasil Monday - Sunday from 5-8 pm in the patio/bar. Every Sunday they have a "Sunday Brunch" from 10 am - 2 pm and have different specials for the brunch so you might want to call and ask if there is a theme for that day. They have several options for events and banquets too.Via  Brazil was a 3 star restaurant in my previous review 3 days ago.  That's nothing to be ashamed about.... it just means the restaurant was nothing great, but not terrible TO ME.  Yelp is a site for posting your opinions.  But some guy named Dustin J. had to send me a private message saying:"We are very sorry that Our Happy Hour is too expensive for you. Please visit McDonalds, Taco Bell and other fast foods if this is too expensive for you"It took me a minute to figure out what restaurant he was referring to, but when I found 20 photos for Via Brasil, I figured it out  Congratulations, guys, I will never return to your restaurant and will make sure nobody I ever talk to does either.  Worst marketing ever.Superior flavor, superior quality. Expect to spend about $80 with drinks , tax, and tip.  Pace yourself and plan for 90 minutes to two hours. Save room for dessert... Or don't. Get such wonderful side dishes as collard greens and fried banana... Or don't. Start with a delicious assortment of salad bar items... Or don't. If you want to, just gorge yourself on the sexy, luscious, delicious, beautiful roasted meats. Be prepared to be pampered by a highly-attentive staff. This restaurant could easily be on everybody's "top 10" list for several reasons: price is acceptable when accounting for the highest quality meats, authentic Brazilian side dishes (ask your server), well-stocked bar, and highly-attentive staff.If you are limiting your caloric intake, are a persnickety price-conscious coupon clipper, pressed for time, out for a quick bite, or just a person who is dissatisfied in general, you probably would not enjoy this restaurant. If you respect the value of quality, and the entire Brazilian churrascuria experience, this restaurant is better than others in the Las Vegas valley because of the taste and quality of the meats and the staff.Serves Glen Morangie single-malt scotch and Stella Artois in the bottle, among many many other alcoholic and non-alcoholic choices.Desserts include (among others) caramel flan, chocolate mousse, brigedeiro's ,and cheesecake.Coffee is strong and delicious.This restaurant earns top accolades.I have come to this restaurant many times, and I have seen it go from barely ok, to good, to great... and it may now be sliding back down to just "ok" when it come to their service. And please don't get me wrong, I will be brutally honest in this review, but this is only with the intention of helping the leadership team at this restaurant identify some disappointing shortcomings I saw during my last visit. As mentioned earlier, this restaurant has worked hard to become a really great churrasqueria in Las Vegas, but yesterday's visit left much to be desired. Let me explain. Hosting several family members for the holidays, I was torn as to what restaurant I could take them to so they could experience a "wow" dining experience, so I chose Via Brazil since they had previously earned my business with great service. In fact, Felipe (our usual waiter) is one of the friendliest and most welcoming waiter there.Having said that, this visit was disastrous! It started with a long wait for meats to come to the table, then the waiters were slow, uninterested in serving us and borderline rude. For example, after trying to cut a piece of meat off the skewer onto my plate, a waiter spilled steak fat onto my shirt... No big deal as it was an accident. What really upset me was the waiter was completely unapologetic and only asked me if I wanted something to clean myself up with.  With an obvious YES as my response, he walked away for close to ten minutes and the sent a different waiter with a rag to clean up the mess. Really?! You spill food on a customer and this is your attitude?The second disappointing mishap was their digital frequent diner program. I have been a member for a while but this time it seemed I annoyed the waiter when I asked him to credit me with the visit. In fact, he denied the free desert I had earned (despite there being no disclaimer on the promotion) and then proceeded to give my family members grief about using their frequent diner app because it was "downloaded on the same day of the visit". Are you telling me this restaurant spends money in a rewards program only to have its staff discourage diners from using it? That's a shame. Lastly, here are some other turn offs from the visit: dirty coffee cups, table was not bussed throughout the visit and waiters' appearance, service standards and demeanor left much to be desired. Please fix this!If I could do no stars, I would because we didn't even get a chance to eat here tonight. It's Valentine's day...I get that but if you take a reservation and call it a reservation, you should be in a position of managing your restaurant in such a way that your customers' tables are ready and available for them at the reserved time.  Especially if that time is a 9 pm reservation because according to Open Table at the time the "reservation" was made, it was the earliest time available for a party of 2. AND especially since Via Brasil called me to confirm the reservation yesterday afternoon. Upon arriving (15 min early, I might add) we discovered several other seemingly disgruntled couples standing outside of the restaurant. We walked in to check in for our 9 pm "reservation" and were told that "unfortunately" they were running behind and were only just seating people with 8 pm reservations meaning that our 9 pm reservation would actually be sat closer to 10 pm. So, the reservation wasn't really a reservation...it was call ahead seating booked through Open Table? For Valentine's dinner?  Riiiight. So, thank you Via Brasil...you actually did us a huge favor. Rather than waiting until nearly 10 pm to eat in your obnoxiously loud and crowded restaurant, we went across the street to Honey Salt and were sat right away.  We had an amazing meal for probably half the cost of what we would have paid at your restaurant. Funny thing about Honey Salt...they recognized the couples eat out at a nice restaurant for Valentine's Day and actually brought in extra tables to accommodate more patrons...GENIUS! Bonus points...they handed out roses to the ladies. Honey Salt is our new fave joint near our house. Separate 5 star review coming shortly for them...I am extremely upset that I had such a negative experience at this restaurant. I will start by saying that the two stars is simply for the food. They have really good food that is really authentic and homestyle Brazilian food which is hard to find in Las Vegas. We went to this restaurant a few times in the past few months and have not had the best service which is really a shame. We asked for a table for three. The restaurant was completely empty and had 3 tables seated. The hostess asked us to wait by the door for a few minutes to "see if they had anything available." We were a bit taken back since the entire place was empty, but patiently waited. About 15 minutes went by and the hostess just stood there staring out into space and wouldn't sit us for some reason. It was so frustrating that it seemed like they did not want our business. Being that we were so hungry we decided to just leave and drive 30 minutes to Texas de Brazil at Town Square. Totally worth it because they were super happy to help us and their service was phenomenal. I promised myself I wouldn't come back to this restaurant because I think customer service is the most important thing for me and this restaurant clearly needs to focus a little less time staring in to space and more time focussing on employee development and training.

They kept the waters coming without me asking - throughout the night, and dished up one of the best pies of pizza that i've tried so far in Pittsburgh (that's not saying too much - but I def ate my fair share of pizza in my brief stay there). The crust was light and thin - and the pie was smoking with fresh cheese, spicy tomato sauce, pepperoni, banana peppers, and jalapenos. Not necessarily the wildest of spots on a Saturday night, but a nice spot to go if you want to hear yourself speak and enjoy a large selection of beer to wash your pizza down with. Oh and word on the street -  is that if you can finish a whole Large pie of Pepperoni and a slice  - by yourself in one sitting -  you may just get your name scribbled in Sharpie behind the top of the back of the bar.

I liked the big parking lot, decor, and space in the dining area.  We had a party of 10 and they took reservations.  Plus plus plus plus!!!  We were seated swiftly and our server came over immediately to take our drink orders.  She was back right away with our drinks.  We had to wait for some of the others in our party to show up.  After waiting 10 mins, we were noitifed that the others were not showing up.  BOO. We got the server's attention and she came over to take our order.  I ordered the meat lover omlette.  The eggs were a little too done but tasty flavor.  The potatoes were good too.  The service was excellent!!!  Never an empty cup and she bought an extra plate without us asking for the kids.  She even offered togo ice teas for us.  WHOA.

I was missing my old neighborhood in Queens (shout out to Astoria!) as I sometimes do, and found myself craving a Greek salad. Not just an ordinary Greek salad, but one piled high with fresh produce and charcoal grilled juicy chicken breast. I knew it would be a task to find one near my Old Town apartment, but one day BF had a gyro craving and off we went. After referencing Yelp, we had narrowed it down to George's Gyros and George's Famous Gyros (I'm in front of Ray's pizza! Famous Ray's? No, just original Jerry!). We actually decided on the non-famous George's, but they were closed on Sunday so our decision was made for us. I'm so glad we ended up here, though-it was delicious! We ordered take-out and placed our order at the counter, so we waited about 10-15 minutes which ended up being just enough time to scope out the staff (who have fun with their job which I love!) and the location (with the office door marked "Pirate"). We also enjoyed the soda fountain-this is a Coca Cola establishment, hooray! And they have a good syrup-to-soda-water ration which is hard to find. Now, on to the food...BF's gyro was GINORMOUS and stuffed to the brim with tasty gyro meat. He gave me a bite (so generous!) and it melted in my mouth. He conquered half of it before saving the rest for later, which he said was just as good cold. The fries that came with it were good, but I will warn you that they gave us Hunt's ketchup packets, so make sure you have your own ketchup at hand if you are like me and have an aversion to Hunt's. My Greek salad was even bigger than the sandwich-TONS of grilled, moist, juicy chicken on top of a *big* salad. And they accommodated my request for no peppers or olives (which, yes, I know, makes it not a "Greek" salad but whateva) which was really cool. There was an abundance of fresh lettuce and veggies, and it was more than enough for two meals. It came with two containers of an oil and vinegar dressing, and hit the spot JUST like my fave Astoria haunts. And it came with garlic bread! Super buttery and crispy and plain delicious. Oh! And the kicker was that both meals came to under $20 including tip, PLUS we got two drinks for free since we checked in with Yelp. I will be back for sure!

Review Text :
Well after seeing "Paul's" glowing review of a place that hadn't even opened yet, I really feel like panning the place. I guess I'll refrain and give you my straight up review.But first a note to "Paul" your a ass clown douchebag. And noting that "Paul" has never reviewed any other place clearly "Paul" is aligned with the owners which is INCREDIBLY SAD and LAME!!!!Here goes:The interior is absolutely beautiful and a welcome change from it's past occupant (The Willow House). My Latte was quite tasty but unfortunately also VERY weak. I was there on the first day of their "soft opening" and they had yet to install a wi-fi access point (kinda a major thing for a coffee shop in my opinion). I was told that they will supply free wif-fi with a purchase, but that had yet to be setup.The art on the walls was from local artists which I totally appreciate. The seating was varied in style and they had a comfy couch. I'd give this place another star if it weren't for the obvious attempt at gaming the Yelp system.Paul Barzda is the general manager (see: http://www.downtownphoenixjournal.com/2008/09/30/hob-nobs-coffee-house-opening-october-1st), so I'm betting that 5 star first review from Paul B. was written by the new management.Anyhow, I went there for the first time today. I wasn't expecting anything like Willow House, but I was still hoping there would be something worth visiting once and a while taking up their old location. I didn't get that. Instead I got a coffee shop stocked full of pastries from Costco, many staff behind the coffee bar (all with name tag/plates), only disposable utensils and cups made of Styrofoam-type material.I'm pretty disappointed with the latte I had. They were out of anything smaller than a 16oz cup to put it in, so it ended up being mostly soy foam. It also took a very long time to prepare for such a well (too many?) staffed bar.I did enjoy the wood floor and the stained glass that was all over.If you're looking for a quick blah coffee on the run or an over priced pastry or sandwich practically from Costco, than this place is a pretty good bet.Otherwise I'd pass.With the mystery user Paul having deleted his "review" ... and with a return visit I'm adding a star to my previous review.The coffee is still nothing to crow about (try Conspire for the best coffee in town IMHO) but my sandwich was pretty good (but over priced). I just SOOOO want to love this place it almost hurts.Well the interior is stunningly beautiful and it's much improved from what was in the venue before (the dirty hippy coffee shop).Hob Nobs Coffee House is in this quaint little old house on McDowell not far from the downtown area.  Upon entering I wasn't clear as to if I was in a coffee house or a trendy gift shop with art for sale everywhere you looked.  I also did not experience the aroma of freshly brewed coffee as I walked in but I was greeted by a very friendly person behind their counter that offered to make me a cup of joe.Their coffee was congenial and pleasant.  They had a limited amount of the normal coffee house accompaniments ~ a few pastries and cookies~ to coffee.  They seemed to be more of a café or dinner based on what they are offering their customers.  Pizza at a coffee house?  Now that's different...  They have a huge selection of pizzas, sandwiches and wraps.  Salads and a few breakfast and bunch options as well.  It was very difficult to get as comfy as I do in most coffee houses, but then again I'm not sure this is really a coffee house but more of a café "slash" gift shop.  Nothing against the owners and I don't blame them for trying to maximize their revenues through additional avenues other than coffee.  But you might consider changing your name to Hob Nobs Café and gift shop?This is a cool place to meet people for lunch you don't know.  Hear me out ~ Their tables and chairs are not very comfy so it makes it easier for you to end your conversation.  This can be a good thing you know : -)This place is super cute. An historic home converted into a bar/coffee shop/cafe/live music venue. They have a surprising large bottled beer selection including a lot of microbrews. This past Sunday they had a beer of the day for only $2, not sure if that is an every day event, but it was a great deal. When the cashier told me she was out of the beer of the day, she said I could substitute for any other beer for the same price - sweet!Service was very friendly, so whatever problems they may have had in the past they seem to have fixed (or fired!) The seating is cosy, albeit limited. The patio is a nice touch when the weather cooperates. There is artwork for sale on the walls, but struggling artists won't be struggling for long if they sell them at those prices! The problem is, they probably won't sell because of the prices, so the artists will remain struggling.The menu leans to the healthy side, but not to the extent of chickpea and cardboard burgers at Pita Jungle (thank god!). I think they call the sandwiches "Artisan" which is apt. The portions are big and the prices reasonable. I had the Smokey Joe on my last visit and a Reuben the previous time. I think the Reuben was the sandwich of the day, didn't see it on the regular menu this time. Both sandwiches were great. The only negative is the parking. There is a little parking lot behind Hob Nobs, but because 3rd Ave is a one way street going the opposite way from McDowell, you will have to navigate around the neighbourhood a little before you find it. Then you'll find it to be full and you will curse Phoenix's one way streets and drive around the neighbourhood one more time to try and find street parking. It's worth the hassle though.

This place has decent food, cute atmosphere, but the service is problematic. I was stuck in Mesa for training and had lunch there on Halloween. My pal and I ordered lunch and about 20 minutes later it arrived, minus the condiments we ordered earlier. Sadly our server was no where to be found, and then when she finally checked on us, I asked again for ranch, and she said sure- like it was the first time she heard the request. Another ten minutes passed and finally she remembers the ranch and brings it by. At this point the fries were cold, so it was kinda pointless. I understand this is merely WPP, but most other places can figure it out, so maybe this spot can up their game.

I love crepes, and as such, I really wanted to try this place out. So, I convinced my wife to go with me for lunch. She's been before and she warned me about the service, but I figured it was just a fluke and it would be fine. Suffice it to say, we came in at lunch time, around 11 and the place wasn't even that busy. Maybe 15 people. The sign said to seat ourselves, so we did, and there we sat unacknowledged for a good 10min. Not even so much as a "hello", or a "we'll be right with you". I think I even saw one of the waiters sitting down watching the tv. I even saw customers getting up to refill their own waters and get napkins for themselves from waiter station. So, we left (without anyone evening noticing), and we will not be returning. I'm the kind of guy that likes to recommend places to his friends, and I will not be recommending this establishment. This is how you lose customers, so take note.

I always take friends and family here, whenever we visit the city. Everyone always loves the steak with mashed potatoes and garden salad. The portion sizes are huge and the price is quite decent. The environment is cute and I never have to wait more than 10 minutes to get a seat.I was very hesitant giving a 5star but the friendly service I received over empowered my experience. As I came in to this "New York style" Deli, i was greeted with a charming smile by suprisingly a lady who didn't seem annoyed I was there like so many of the waitresses I deal with over the past years. She was smilling and wanted me to be well taken care of. There was a huge line for the seatings so I was ready to order to go. I prefer ordering to go in general since they give more portions and I like to see if their packing skills are on point. As I was ordering more than one item, she kindly asked me to go to the counter where there was a handsome young man by the name of "Alex" who assisted me with a nice big smile! He was so sweeet!!!! He took my order very quickly and everything I asked he made sure I got. Service at this resto is DAY and NIGHT if we compare it to Shwartz. The resto itself: this place was jam packed but yet there's ENOUGH waiters to assist everyone and apparently they thought there was not enough people for what they are normally use to. It's a very spacious resto with lots of delicious items on the menu.The Menu and my order: Gosh you do not understand how delicious their fries are !!! I believe the fries I have had were the best fries I tasted in a very very long time !!!!So crispyyyyy and slim not too much mash inside. They're fries and not mash potato. Very well seasoned to perfection.The reason I was hesitant however between a 4 and A 5 star is because of the smoked meat itself. I am not going to lie it was a little dry but I did specify that I wanted medium/fat. I guess they made a mistake. Their coleslaw is to die for !& the potato latkas had such a great authentic flavour.Overall, this place is high on my list of repeats. I am very glad I gave this place a shot !!!! It sure did not dissapoint xD yummmyy

This McDonald's is conveniently nearby the Pepsi Center.It opens late, and was perfect for the post-clubbing crowd I was with.A friend bought me a McChicken sandwich (not sure why, but I appreciated it), which I made short work of - it tasted normal, as expected.My husband, Jim W., teases me because I only have one and five star reviews.  I guess that's what it takes to motivate me.  Apparently, I was really motivated this morning at McDonald's.No one over the age of eight goes to McDonald's for the food.  We either go because it's quick (sometimes) or cheap (not anymore) or convenient or because we are craving that childhood food memory.  So Jim and I met there this morning  (score one for convenient) for a quick snack and chat about the week.While we're waiting for the food I notice a sign that says they have free samples on Monday morning.  I was fascinated by this.  Since when has McDonald's offered samples?  And who hasn't tried their potatoes and needs to know what they taste like?  Who doesn't know the taste of crunchy grease without a reminder?  So, curiosity getting the better of me, I asked for a sample.  I really wanted to see what it was.  That's when I was reminded where, exactly, I was.I was told that there was no way I could have a sample.  When I inquired why that was I was informed that the person accompanying me had ordered what they were sampling.Oh.Though most yelpers know my prolific yelper husband, this woman did not.  In fact, she had no idea who he was in relation to me.  He could have been my husband but he could just as easily been an anal colleague who would rather die than allow me to sample his food, which I assume was the implication in her refusal.Now, I acknowledge that this is a ridiculous nothing of an issue.  But these days I run into more and more silly little annoyances and I just couldn't let this one pass.  You see, the woman was very satisfied with herself, as if I was trying to "get over on the man" (i.e. McDonald's) and she thwarted me.  It's just so stupid.  So, I guess they saved themselves a quarter of a hash brown but they got this nifty review instead.As to the biscuit I did eat, well ... it was McDonald's.

Instead of writing a review I'm going to write a warning. Avoid this place at all costs. If you want a lesson on how to run a successful Mexican restaurant do not come here. From the kid at the hostess stand to the sub par food this was truly a horrible experience.Of course you start with complimentary chips and salsa. Chips were room temp and not a single grain of salt. Both salsas, one mild chunky and another hot and smooth were both lacking salt, garlic and heat, essentially tomato sauce with some red pepper flakes added for good measure.We ordered a quesadilla with green chile ($6.00) and what they call a Hal's Sampler For Two ($15.95) which is a sampling of all their house specials. Pollo Fundido, mini chimi's, flauta's, tostada's and a green corn tamale served with rice and beans. Sounds promising and a no brainer.As soon as the quesadilla arrived we knew what we were in for. The green chile's were of the canned variety and from the first bite, of the old variety. While the cheese was melted the quesadilla was just above room temp and the tortilla was more dried out then actually crisped on a flat top grill. Each bite being worse then the last as the barely melted cheese coagulated around the wet mushy diced chile's. No amount of salsa could save this one, it was d.o.a..Then the sampler arrived, if there were any high hopes of melty cheeses and tastes of thick guacamole they were squashed just as soon as the plate arrived. The plate of beige, had cheeses but were barley melted and like the quesadilla, everything was just above room temperature. Let me tell you, there was nothing redeeming or delicious on this plate. Just a sampler of dried out, deep fried food covered in cheese and some hyper green, bland version of guacamole.After a few bites of this and that we asked for the check and made our way for the door. When I asked our server for a to go menu, she seemed genuinely shocked that I may have thought that the food was good enough to order again. I only needed it to make sure I got the information correct when writing this review. The owner's should be ashamed of themselves. In a market where there is decent Mexican food abound this kind of crap just doesn't fly.

Today I ate here and the beans were way too salty to eat and the rice was almost the same, but a little more tolerable. Wanted to send it back, but my husband insisted that I let it go. Also, one of the worker's had a child running around the restaurant ( about 5 years old), and he was touching everything ( silverware, napkins, toothpicks) it was horrible!! The child was climbing on the front counter and running back and forth and sliding on the floor. I may give the place another try in the future because I have had good food here in the past. Sorry Filiberto's :(

Le Milsa, c'est pour les mangeux de viandes. Les serveurs munis de broches fumantes te coupe l'animal directement dans ton assiette; filet mignon, porc, bœuf, saucisses, bacon de dinde.. Overall le concept peut être très agréable lorsqu'en bonne compagnie. J'y suis allée pour l'anniversaire d'un ami. Puisque je suis pas folle de viande, j'ai choisi le saumon, dont la cuisson était parfaite. Il y a aussi des à côtés un peu anodins qui viennent à volontés avec toutes les assiettes, alors j'ai pu manger des champignons et des patates douces quand j'eus finis mon plat et que les autres se délectaient encore de rouge. La bouffe, top notch, rien à redire.Il y a aussi un carnaval en repeat sur des TVs et pendant 30 minutes il y a une danseuse en paillettes qui vient divertir la foule du restaurant principalement constitués d'hommes fêtant a) leur enterrement de vie de garçon ou b) leur anniversaire. C'était quand même drôle.Là où l'expérience a pris un tournant désagréable, c'est au niveau de notre serveuse principale (on a plein de serveurs, mais la je parle de celle a qui faut donner du tip). Nous étions un groupe de 20, et jamais elle n'est venu se présenter ou nous servir de l'eau. Y'a même quelqu'un du groupe qui est aller s'acheter un coke diète dehors au milieu du repas et qui est revenu avec la bouteille dans le resto parce que "hey, elle nous sert pas d'eau et j'ai soif!". Y'a fallu qu'on demande à la pauvre fille qui nous apportait le pain de nous donner de l'eau, elle on voyait la peur dans ses yeux parce qu'elle savait que c'était pas sa job et qu'elle pouvait de faire chicaner. Elle je l'aimais, elle était fine. La serveuse principale par contre, non. Dès notre arrivée, elle nous demande avec son air bête si on veut consommer de l'alcool, et si tu en prends pas, elle va revenir 8 fois te demander si tu veux boire quelque chose, juste pour être sur que tu aies pas soudainement envie de dépenser 60$ pour un pichet de liquide qui ressemble a du carwash. C'était juste ça sa job, nous servir de l'eau et l'alcool, mais on dirait qu'elle a eu 50% dans son test de serveuse. Ensuite vient le temps de payer. Et la première chose que tu entends quand elle arrive c'est OK LÀ SI TU AS PAS PAYER TU RESTES ASSIS. Elle a même limite envoyer chier le père du fêté parce qu'il voulait se lever pour.. Ben pour être debout parce que c'est long 4h assis! Elle prend les facture de la première moitié du groupe, repart.. Et c'est après 30 minutes de disparition qu'on s'écœure et qu'on va la voir à sa caisse. Elle devait avoir de la misère a trouver le bon bouton pour faire les factures qui étaient toutes au même prix parce que le menu est à un prix unique tsé. On a clairement pu observer un échange avec son patron lorsqu'il lui a demandé ce qu'elle faisait et pourquoi tout le monde avait pas encore payer, et qu'elle lui a répondu "ben je fais payer une moitié en première, puis je sors les factures pour l'autre moitié après!" Mais la cerise sur le sundae, c'est quand elle nous dit que quelqu'un a pas payer. Et qu'elle a obligé quelqu'un à payer le repas supplémentaire. Nous traiter de voleur, pardon? On a tous l'immense certitude qu'on a gaspillé plus de 100$ pour deux chez vous, et tu oses nous dire qu'on te doit un repas de plus? J'ai jamais été une grosse mangeuse de viande. Mais là c'est définitif, le Milsa, plus jamais.Shoutout à la ptite jeune blonde qui nous servait de l'eau et du pain. Lâche pas.

Was jonesing for a Burger and decided to go to Fuddrucker's.  I love this place.  I would come here with a couple of friends at least once a month when we all worked together.....but that was a couple of years ago, so it was time to see an old friend.When I pulled up, I was surprised to see a sign advertising Free WiFi....perfect, now I found a new place to study!After a few minutes I decided to go with the 1/3 lb Burger Combo ($9.99) and a 1/2 lb Burger ($5.99).  I ordered American Cheese ($.75) on one and Pepper Jack ($.75) on the other.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/AL5YzikrmxwcBzBNLGO7Jw?select=Fctoo65ZB1jpFxM1_zpamghttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/AL5YzikrmxwcBzBNLGO7Jw?select=_PZGFceSYTI1jygSRi5N6AOne of the things I love about Fuddrucker's is the fresh toppings bar where you can load up whatever you want on your Burger.  I decided to put Onions, Jalapenos, Mayo, and Mustard.  I also got some melted Jalapeno Cheddar Cheese for dipping my Fries.The Burgers were tasty of course and the Fries were perfect!  The combo came with a Soda and I went with Coke Zero.....I'm not a Soda drinker, but I think I'm becoming addicted to Coke Zero.....have to stop that soon.Overall, it was another great meal @ Fuddrucker's!Return Factor - 93.5%

One of our only Cajun restaurants but at least it's a good one, and out in a section on NDG that keeps getting cuter. This place has been earning their reputation for over 20 years, not clichéd decor, just a nice, candlelit restaurant with buzz, good gumbo, and some awesome "dinosaur" beef ribs.

Review Text :
This is by far one of the most memorable dining experience I've EVER had. If not the most. The concept is simple. You're trying to experience life as a visually impaired person, albeit only for a short few hours and in a controlled environment.  The main dining room is completely dark - not dark as in "your bedroom when you turn off the lights to sleep" dark, but dark as in "your eyes never adjust, you can't even see your fingers when you hold them up right in front of your eyes!" dark.  You decide your two or three-course meal in advance ($34 and $41 respectively) in a separate room, where you are also led back to at the end to settle the bill.  The selection was bigger than I imagined for a prix fixe menu, including a moderate drink list.   Each course also includes a "surprise" dish which I highly recommend to broaden your experience. You're then led into the pitch-black dining room by placing your left hand on your waiter's shoulder and forming a train with your fellow tablemates. The rest of the dinner continues in this tactile manner - the waiter places your hand on the chair you are to be seated, the waiter passes and collects your plates by brushing them over your shoulder, etc. It's true what they say about other senses being heightened when you lose one. But it may surprise you that they can also betray you - such as voices sounding closer or farther than they really are or your taste buds tricking you to think you're eating something you're not. For example, without giving away too much about the surprise dishes, we incorrectly thought the beef tartar was salmon, which the waiter said was a common observation (er no pun intended).  And I swear there was liqueur in the dessert as I was devouring it, but it didn't. I guess it was wishful thinking. You'll find yourself having trouble cutting up some of the food or determining if you've finished everything on your plate; but don't forget that these are just minor challenges a blind person has to deal with everyday. All was going well for me until near the end of the dinner, when I decided to try something from the person sitting across from me.  I knocked over my glass of water because I had forgotten it was there! I knew it was the right decision not to order red wine that night. We had intended to visit the Toronto location but due to a scheduling conflict, we ended up at the Montreal location and I'm so glad we did. This location has higher reviews due to the calibre of the food, such that the experience was more than just a novelty. And I can attest to this - the food was delicious and I would visit again. Definitely an insightful (pun intended this time) and exhilarating experience you have to try at least once. Food: 4*Ambiance: ????Service: 5* (The waiter was very attentive and came around to check on us often.. but I guess he had to be given the scenario!)Value: 4* (I struggled with this one. $41 is steep for what you get.  But then again, it's an experience you can't get anywhere else.)What an incredibly memorable dining experience. This is the kind of place you'll go to once and then tell people about it over and over again because it was so unique.I think the entire concept is beautiful. O.Noir hires people who are legally blind, a portion of the proceeds go to an NPO that helps the legally blind find work, and you spend the entire evening in a completely pitch black environment -- you literally see NOTHING, which is such an unusual experience for those of us who are used to visually absorbing the food and atmosphere around us. But they say when one of your senses is removed, the others are heightened, which is exactly how I felt here at O.Noir. Taste, smell, hearing, feeling... all those things became so much more important than I knew.  We called ahead to make sure we could eat a gluten free meal, which they were easily able to accommodate. Then we ordered the 3 course surprise dinner, so we were served and then able to guess what we were eating afterwards. We started with a tuna tartare salad (amazing textures), then duck confit with potatoes and apple (the duck was incredibly rich and buttery), and ended with a fabulous creme brulee. All of the food had beautiful, strong aromas and a wonderful variance in textures.More than once I put my fork to my mouth and there was nothing on my fork. HAHaha. I mean, it's soooo dark. Your eyes will NOT adjust to the light because there is none, and you have to put your phone in a locker before you enter the dining room, which your server will lead you to. If you have to use the restroom, call out for your waiter! There is the tiniest, dimmest light ever in the bathroom, but other than that -- complete darkness. I almost felt dizzy until I got used to being in the pitch black and grew more comfortable with all the sounds around me. Don't worry, you get to order your drinks and food in the bar area before you enter the noir-est dining room ever!

Review Text :
Kudos to Sam Fox and Dr Andrew Weil for their new partnership and restaurant concept - I love it!  Seriously, I could eat at TFK every day and be happy...I've been twice for dinner so far, and both times I've sat outside.  Both times I've had great service with Damon as my waiter and the rest of the staff extremely attentive and friendly as well.  (Drinks are constantly filled, dishes cleared in a timely manner, and even the space heaters outside turned on to our liking).  Along with the healthy gourmet menu which I love, the vibe in the restaurant is energetic and fun.During my two visits, I've sampled the following appetizers:  edamame dumplings, shrimp dumplings, and veggie crudites with dip.  I ordered the miso glazed black cod as my entree both visits - (it's served with the perfect miso sauce, tasty mushrooms and bok choy... it's fantastic and each bite of the perfectly grilled fish melts in your mouth).  I've also tasted the turkey bolognese and the butternut squash ravioli.  Desserts I can speak of include the lemon ginger frozen yogurt dessert (served with pomegranate) and although I haven't personally tasted it, I've watched others at my table devour the apple crumble cake. There's nothing I tasted so far that I didn't like and there are so many more items on the menu that I want to try!I hope to go for lunch one day soon as well.  Prices are reasonable and because everything is so healthy, you'll actually feel good after eating at TFK.A couple of suggestions for TFK:1 - take reservations for smaller parties!  Luckily, I haven't had to wait more than a half hour during my visits, but it would be nice if you would take a reservation for a smaller party...2 - make your bar bigger!  There are not enough seats to have those waiting enjoy your delicious drinks!Thanks for two healthy, delicious, and fun meals so far, TFK - and cheers to many more to come!This may be my new favorite!! Everything is trans fat free 100%. The wait was pretty crazy but it was worth it. The whole feel of the place is really cool. I always want to eat healthy but not cook, never can I get both. Lots of places claim to be healthy but after several probing questions I usually find a few things that are tainted with trans fat and high fructose corn syrup. Not here though!!! Being a lesbian I have a lot of vegan/vegetarian friends. (I guess lesbians really don't like meat) They always want to go out but I find that most vegan/vegetarian places have less than good food. They almost always seem like the kitchen would be all dirty. I cant wait to take my non meat eating friends here. Here's what I got The butternut squash ravioli = awesome! The dough is made I think like gluten free or something, which isn't a selling point for me but it was very good. Usually the gluten free noodles are sick, I actually really liked the texture and taste. Its in a yogurt honey sauce, to me sounded a little gross. My gf ordered it but it was delicious, it was the perfect sweetness. It was served hot which I thought it may be cold I guess because of the yogurt factor. I ordered the root veggies. I did really like it but I thought they flavor could have been a little more herby. It wasn't bland but I think the flavor for sure could have been kicked up a notch. The Farro that came with it, was super good. I wish there was more of it especially for 15 bucks. The bathroom was weird, it was really small. The door was thin sheet metal and so was he lock. When you lock the stall it makes the most awefal screechy metal nose. The soap was actually a natural soap which was nice but not antibacterial. Ok, they habd the coolest hand dryer, I mean this thing is bad ass. You put your hands in it like a car wash dryer. I dont know how to describe it but make sure you check that bitch out :)I'm confused a little on this place and here's why. 1)Spiffy new, contemporary interior but it seems more like a fancy Pei Wei than an upscale restaurant. The prep table is in the front of the house, and why do I need to see people cut up vegetables as part of the dining experience? 2) The first thing you see on the menu are fresh healthy fruit drinks then at the bottom of the list they say "add a shot of vodka for $3". Seemed very strange to me. 3) We had great service, actually some of the best I've had in a long time, but there were easily 10+ staffers hovering around as you walked in which kinda made it like I had just pulled into a used car lot with all the salespeople getting ready to pounce on me. I'm guessing there were 30 employees total that night and about 60 guests in the place. 4) Food: Had an onion tart, butternut squash raviolis and a side of fresh green vegetables. Can't complain much food was really good, but in that healthy, locally grown, organic, blah blah blah way. I like this place, but it's in the Biltmore and I don't typically go here often at all. Food is good, simple and fresh so maybe a better lunch stop with the girls than a hearty dinner destination with the boys.8/14Came in for a late lunch.  Place was like a can of sardines, with a line that would've formed outside the door had it not been so hot.  Instead, we all clustered around the host's podium.  Surprised, I was seated almost immediately.  See, there are advantages to dining solo.  Had questions for the server, who had to go back to find out the answers, but at least she did try and was friendly about it.  I asked about the separate dining area at the back.  Don't quote me on this, but I think she said that the room can be reserved for a minimum of $100 expenditure for lunch and $200 for dinner (significance of info will be revealed shortly).Ordered the onion tart, which was comprised of smoky garlic, succulent figs, and pungent gorgonzola, which paired well with the star of the show- you guessed it- caramelized onions.  Loved the thin crust, which was made of spelt and flax flour- great ingredients for those who aren't allergic.  (I'm allergic to many wholesome LDL-reducing, high-fiber, anti-inflammatory, and anti-oxidant enriched foods, but I will gladly suffer a few hours of pain and other discomforts for another TFK onion tart!)Does this place ever slow down?  'Cause that's the only time I'll stop by for another bite to eat.  It was VERY noisy in here (private room would be a great option to look into if with a group), and the nervous energy was at odds with the forest and water moodscape that surrounded me.  BTW, the clip board (made of wood, not plastic or pleather) holding the receipt was a cute touch.  Too bad I spied (well, it really wasn't spying since they were right there in the open!) the kitchen staff stuffing cut veggies into ziploc sandwich bags... y'know those bags will just end up in landfills or the ocean :(This place has all the amazing potential in the world. It's a cool concept and I certainly appreciate the plethora of vegetarian and vegan options they have available, but I gotta say: bland, boring, blah.The hummus was good, but certainly not the "best in the valley" as our waiter purported. I ended up adding salt.My "LTL" (veggie version of the BLT) was very bland. I added salt and that didn't even help. My bread was slightly burned and the potato hash that they gave as a side was cold, limp and you could tell it was burned during the cooking process.The vegan pizza was also pretty boring. It was a combo of olive oil and red sauce. They could have spruced it up with some spices and made it really flavorful, but it definitely left me wanting for more.I appreciate the charcoal water filtration system that helps eliminate "water bottle waste" but I don't know that charging $2 for the table is necessary.The honey lemonade was good but gave me a tummy ache, and the nojito just had way too much going on (honey, lime, ginger, soda water, etc).Our service was good, if not a little overbearing, otherwise I would give this place 2 stars. The food is boring and extremely overpriced. Our casual lunch turned into $50, and there was no alcohol involved.I am all for health and I support the cause, but they really need to do something about the taste of the dishes.Sooo disappointed. Arrived here yesterday with a friend at about 4:15pm. Seated promptly. An over bubbly petite girl approached our table.. (you know the kind.. TGI Fridays "flare" type) speaking in cheerleading tones, we'll call her "bubbles" letting us know our server would be with us in a minute.. right as our server arrived.  There were maybe 5 tables sat including ours in all areas of the restaurant and Ill be damned if our poor server wasnt waiting on every single one of them.. which explains why she wasnt very attentive. Not really her fault..Our food did arrive in a timely fashion delivered by "Bubbles". My friend had ordered the squash casserole and had asked if bread was available for her to order and the attitude and outright snottiness of bubbles next comment decided the gratuity and the fact we will never go back. She said " we dont have bread.. this isnt the Outback." You should have seen the looks on our faces.  She then catches herself and says we have pita and my friend staes "nevermind, that's not what I was looking for". Bubbles goes away and comes back with an order of pita anyway. We sat in silence for a good 5 minutes.. apalled at that little bitch's outburst. As a manager I would have fired her on the spot for speaking to a patron in that manner. After the "incident" and our meal was finished, the plates were cleared and we sat...and sat while our server tended to the rest of her tables. Meanwhile there are 5 servers doing sidework right in front of us.. including Bubbles (who mind you was leaning over the sidework table laughing and not helping her coworkers at all). We made eye contact with several of them hoping they would notice we were looking for our server and nothing. We had actually wanted dessert but by the time our server finally showed we just wanted to leave. Im sure our server would have been great had she had any form of assistance from her coworkers. But the snottiness of the self righteous self entitled Bubbles was inexcusable.Im sure you're wondering about the food.. it's decent but not anything amazing..too many restaurants in Phoenix to come back here for their food, let alone to be talked down to by the staff.Oh and also, we were told their tomatoes are flown in from tuscany.. Seriously? In this economy you're flying tomatoes in from Italy and not supporting your local markets..FAIL03/11/10Had a fantastic breakfast today!!  After a meeting at work, I asked a couple of coworkers if they'd like to join me for breakfast.  One is a health nut like me, so I knew he'd be up for breakfast at TFK.  Thank goodness I'd mentioned for them to look for The Cheesecake Factory, or they'd never have found the place.  (BTW, what is up w/ the paid parking there these days?  It had been awhile since I'd been there last, and I was much relieved to find that two-hour parking is free w/ validation, or I'd have to stop dining at The Biltmore.)After waiting a long while for them to arrive, I went ahead and placed my order for Wild Sockeye Salmon Lox since it didn't seem like my coworkers were going to make it (no contact #s and they weren't familiar w/ the area) and I either read breakfast hours wrong online, or the times had been extended (the website currently posts correct hours), and I wanted to have breakfast, not lunch!  While I waited for my food, said coworkers showed up and stood around not knowing what to order.  I suggested that one of them try the Quinoa Blueberry Johnny Cake, and he readily did when he noticed that ALL included ingredients were on his list of cholesterol-reducing foods!  The other wanted to see what organic eggs tasted like, so she had the Two Organic Eggs.  [I'll go easy on her... she's not a foodie! ;)]The lox dish was a beauty, and it tasted even more exquisite! Generous portions of wild sockeye salmon sat on six charred grain bread (made in-house, and, as far as I could tell, indeed had many grains, as well as ribbons of thinly-sliced carrots), creamy labneh cheese (oh my!), and onions, plus sliced cherry tomatoes.  I practically inhaled this platter of food, it was so delectable!  I was almost finished w/ this selection when my coworker's johnnycakes arrived.  Yes, I said cakes-- the menu alluded to just the one.  His plate included three beautiful johnnycakes, with blueberries cooked within, as well as fresh blueberries added on top of a huge dollop of Greek yogurt and Maple Grove Farms' organic maple syrup (no need to reach into my purse for my own!  LOL).  He was gracious enough to let me sample, and so I did!  I was greedy enough to order my own plate of johnnycakes-- I ate all but half of a cake!The other coworker hardly touched her breakfast.  Maybe she wasn't hungry.  Maybe she didn't like the taste of organic eggs?  Maybe, maybe.03/23/10Came back for more quinoa blueberry johnnycakes AND a take-out of savory Greek frittata!  As pictured, the open-faced omelet, which included organic eggs, slices of red onion, kalamata olives, tomato, feta, and oregano, didn't look appetizing, but don't believe your eyes!  This tasty selection was highly-satisfying, and I'm sure, given its chance to make its debut graced over a pristine plate, it would have made for some quality food porn!  ;)  Check out the portion size of accompanying grain bread!  Look closely, and you can spot some of those carrot strands I wrote about earlier...I really must try dinner here someday, but only if I can secure that private room in the back.  It's too noisy out in the main dining room...Smoothies and Omelets and Johnny Cakes Oh My!True Food Kitchen is by far one of my favorite spots in the Valley, and definitely my favorite Fox concept.  I was a huge fan before, but now with the addition of breakfast on the menu, I could eat at TFK for every meal and never get bored... While I have my favorite menu items for each meal, I do mix it up now and again.  However,  do not - I repeat, do not go to TFK for breakfast unless you are going to get at least one order of the Quinoa Blueberry Johnny Cakes for the table.  Served with pure maple syrup and Greek yogurt, this dish is a godsend from heaven!  And while I'm here updating my original TFK review, I have to add that service is always fabulous.  Damon has a special place in my heart as he was my first ever server, and continues to be friendly and attentive when I get seated in his section, but I've had numerous other servers, and they've all been awesome.  I hope that the new Scottsdale Quarter location will be just as successful as this one.Until next time, TFK - see you soon!5/29/10Came in after a failed attempt to dine at Zin Burger next door (I ended up ordering only the sweet potato fries there- not good.  Very soggy.).  Nice friendly greeting at the door, and I was seated right away.  (Sad to see TFK's business was much slower than that of ZB's.)Ordered my favorite, the onion tart, but I also wanted to try something new- the Columbia River steelhead salmon, which the menu promised it comes with shiso (red or green leafy greens), lime, avocado (hold the avo, please!), and cilanto aioli.  It is served on the bread made in-house.  For dessert, I tried the chocolate muffin/cake w/ organic butter ice cream, organic chocolate sauce, and cocoa nibs (!).The salmon sandwich was excellent!!  Everything that comprised this sandwich was fabulous, from the whole-grain and veggie bread and the lime and cilantro aioli slathered on it, to the oh-so-moist medium-rare salmon, tomato, and the not-so-usual leafy topping, shiso.  It took all my willpower to not eat the entire thing!  I wish I could say the same about the kale salad and sweet potato hash...  The kale was so tough to chew.  However, chewing wouldn't have been such a task if the kale wasn't also very dry!  My salad was pretty rough, so I abandoned it right away.  [I know that kale is SO VERY good for me, but sometimes what's good for my health isn't so great for my digestive system :( ]  I wasn't a fan of their hash in the past, and tonight's side dish didn't win me over, either.  I won't give it another chance.  Another disappointment was the onion tart.  First, the presentation left me wondering who took a chunk off my plate and ate it?  No, this was just how it was assembled and baked, I was told.  Variances, he said.  The exquisite crunch I so loved in this pizza was gone, and so was the flavor.  Very bland.  Another menu item I must cross of my list :( Oh, but the dessert!!  Very moist cake, which sat on silky, rich organic dark chocolate sauce, with lovely (!) crushed cocoa nibs- loved that crunch!  I think I surprised my server by guessing correctly what those nibs were!  (I've had them before in trail snack bags from Whole Foods.)  The best part?  Why, the homemade butter ice cream!  I need to go back and have another scoop (or two!) very soon...Excellent service- very informative.  Kudos to my server who never showed impatience after having to answer all of my questions- some of which he had to go back to the kitchen a few times, too!  Thank you very much!Please indicate if the following points are True or False:-   You and Matt were really excited to visit True Food Kitchen during Restaurant Week. TRUE-   Upon arrival, the two of you were happy to be seated promptly without a reservation. TRUE-   The cheerful restaurant décor infused you with organic, healthy, and sustainable vibes. TRUE-  You and Matt really enjoyed sitting outdoors on the cozy patio that was artistically bordered with green grass. TRUE -   The menu's variety of healthy and fresh options initially looked impressive and yummy. TRUE-   It took your waiter about 10 minutes to acknowledge your existence after being seated, even though the restaurant wasn't very crowded. TRUE-   When the waiter finally arrived, he didn't welcome you to the restaurant, introduce himself or even explain the concept behind the menu that Dr. Weil & Mr. Fox created. Instead he looked bored and just wanted to know your order. TRUE -   Waiters at Applebee's have made a better first impression than he did. TRUE -   The seasoned hummus appetizer, topped with a flavorful Mediterranean mix of Kalamata olives, cucumbers, feta and sliced pearl tomatoes impressed both of you. However the amount of time it took this dish to make its way to your table did not. TRUE-  It seemed like the entire restaurant staff was playing a game of "Guess Who?" - waiters kept moronically walking around with food, stopping at different tables and trying to guess who ordered what. TRUE-   At least 4 times (it occurred so frequently you stopped counting), a random waiter placed someone else's food in front of you, and you had to tell them that they guessed wrong. TRUE-  You ordered a salad, tofu teriyaki bowl and frozen yogurt with berries. Matt ordered the smoked salmon, steak tacos and flourless chocolate cake. It was healthy, fresh and good but definitely NOT worth the $100+ bill including a bottle of wine. TRUE-  You both felt robbed. A much more pleasant, faster and cheaper alternative would have been to buy the wine and ingredients from Trader Joes or Whole Foods and prepare this "simple" meal yourselves. TRUE-  A snail could have cooked and served your "simple" meal faster then the 3 painstaking hours it took your waiter. TRUE-  The restaurant's parking validation is only good for two free hours in the lot - but the wait staff decided to play that irritating game of "Guess Who?" and couldn't serve your "simple" meal in less than two hours - so to top it all off, you STILL had to pay for parking, which was beyond upsetting after so many other let downs. TRUE -   Although you liked the décor and really wanted to love this restaurant, you don't recommend it to anyone since you have most certainly tasted MUCH better health food. TRUEThank you for your responses to these True Food Kitchen statements. We are excited for when you return to enjoy more of our overpriced food and overwhelmingly bad service. FALSE!!!I am a huge fan of cooking. I also love places that sell fresh food. After days of hanging by the pool, I decided to get out and venture over to the Biltmore Fashion Park. I checked the photos and figured that the True Food Kitchen was the place for me. I sat at the bar and had a little trouble figuring out what to eat, it all looked great but I was craving fish. I ordered the fish tacos and decided on the Skinny Margarita. It's called a skinny margarita because it's made with fresh juices and not because it's made with that low-calorie margarita mixer. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/XMMLRvV4IMxIGyc4H37LxA#QnIja5A6SwqeJcFfPfZRqAThe margarita was refreshing and my tacos were great. Very light, freshly made and my server Jake brought me two different types of hot sauce. I like it spicy and appreciated it very much. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/XMMLRvV4IMxIGyc4H37LxA#kVbK8jNzkNTAeL2ReBCpMQThe lunch was light and tasty, which was perfect and tasted like something I would make at home. It's very refreshing to find places that are not chain restaurants and serve fresh food you can watch them preparing. That's why I truly enjoyed the True Food Kitchen.What I wouldn't give to have this restaurant that's just bursting with good healthy fresh food - packed with vegetables, no less - in my city.Our party of 5 was seated at a king sized wooden tables, of which there are many. I remark on this because I'm from two cities where they cram us all in so that we're intimate with strangers. I realize I might not mind this too much. We pretty much had to shout across the table to each other, the tables are so large! I'd be more bugged by that if I wasn't so in love with the concept and food. Regardless, it's good to know that large groups can be accommodated (10 probably could have fit at our table!)Our shared apps:-crudité with dips (loved the black olive!) I really *really* wish huge bowls of fresh, crunchy veggies would become an American restaurant trend, ruling over the damn bacon or *insert your unhealthy comfort food* trends that I'm positive only exist  thanks to a backfire that BS fat-free 90s food trend. Anyway, I fully accept such a trend probably won't happen anytime soon. -herbed hummus (divine! It has a unique taste and excellent texture).I ordered and did *not* share because it was so good I conveniently forgot:-the mouthwatering Tuscan Kale salad(one of the best I've ever had in a restaurant)-TLT with avocado(piles of freshness: lettuce, beautiful tomato, lush avocado and crispy tempeh SO plentiful, I should have stopped at one half but I couldn't stop!!)Dessert? Oh, I would have tried, believe me, if half as good as all that preceded it, no doubt would have been incredible. But I was immobile by meal's end.True Food is the healthiest franchise I've ever had the fortune of experiencing! Here's to hoping they branch out to New Orleans.Fresh, healthy food and great service in a bright, open space.  The servings aren't large and the prices are high for the portion size, but everything is interesting, genuinely healthy and delicious.  Love this place!I've come here for breakfast in smaller and larger groups (2-6) and the service is always on point.  The market scramble is lovely (not heavy with oil like a lot of breakfasts, yet quite filling), as are the Quinoa Johnny Cakes (they just taste like fluffy, delicious pancakes - get the yogurt on the side to make sure you like it as a topping).The also have wonderful lunch/dinner options! A few favorites include the shitake tofu lettuce wraps (wow! flavor) and the new seared spicy tuna wrap (my friend tasted it and said, "Woah!  I didn't know tuna could be this good!"), the red chili shrimp and the spaghetti squash casserole (this one is a little smaller, so get an appetizer if you're hungry).The regular drinks, like the Cucumber Refresher, are absolutely delicious, but the Juby True juices are quite hit-or-miss, according to a few juice-loving friends.

Restaurant name  The Tamale Store
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
Anticipating a grueling swim team practice in the evening, I went here yesterday afternoon to get a tasty, stick-to-the-ribs lunch. I got two beef red chili tamales and a pumpkin tamale. The beef tamales were scrumptious, as expected. The pumpkin tamale, which I ordered out of curiosity, was excellent! It was rich and just sweet enough to provide a pleasant counterpoint to the savory beef tamales without being dessert-sweet. And for 6 bucks, that lunch sustained me through the afternoon and through the rigorous physical activity of the evening. As I said in my previous review, the Tamale Store is far from where I live, but now more than ever I'm convinced that it's well worth the drive. And I'm planning to get frozen tamales next time so I'll be well-stocked with these tasty treats.Tamales sounded like a perfect late-morning breakfast as we wandered through the Old Town Scottsdale Farmers Market. The list of frozen tamales for purchase at the Tamale Store stand was impressively long, with meat and vegetarian options. The hot, ready-to-eat choices included chipotle chicken and mushroom with cream cheese. The chicken tamal(e) was my favorite, with large pieces of meat and a smoky sauce tucked inside the moist masa. The mushroom one was also good, but not as flavorful. Considering how time-consuming it is to make tamales (my sister-in-law spends hours on them), if there were a Tamale Store in my town, I'd definitely be a regular.As their sign says "unwrap a fiesta" It is a party in your mouth... take that as you will. Meat and Masa.. you cannot really go wrong. I love all their combos that they offer.... I ate off the boyfriend's beef tamales and it was YUMMMMY!!  Another high point from the Scottsdale Farmer's MarketThis review is for their tamales only.  I haven't been to this location, I bought mine at the Phoenix Public Market.OMG these are some of the best tamales I've ever had!!  I've tried the beef with red chile, the green chile chicken, the chicken chipotle and green chile corn cream cheese.  There was plenty of filling and you could even tell by looking at it, what it was filled with.  The taste was amazing, and spiced nicely.  They heat in 2 minutes in the microwave (I left them in the paper wrapper and corn husk) and they steamed inside to a perfect moist and hot tamale for your eating pleasure.  These tamales are exactly the way all tamales should be!I am happy to know I can buy these at the Mesa Farmers Market on Fridays without having to go all the way downtown.  You can be sure I'll stock up again!OH MAH GAWD!Normally I don't *love* tamales because they are relatively dry, but when I saw The Tamale Store selling Tamales at the Downtown Public Market I just had to try one. They have three regular vegan options in addition to two dessert vegan options, and 5 vegetarian options.So, I decided to get a hot Southwest Chipotle and ate it at the market, and got an additional 6 frozen; a combo of Southwest Chipotle, Pumpkin, and Sweet Corn.Well, these tamales are freaking delicious. Incredibly moist and flavorful, but with very few ingredients, and you can pronounce all of them! Their website touts "We use only the freshest produce and extra lean meats. We never use lard or shortenings. We never use preservatives!!" It is OBVIOUSLY true.I love The Tamale Store!!!I am so glad this business sells Tamales at the Downtown Public Market because there's no way I am driving to Cave Creek just to buy them. Don't get me wrong. They are good and delicious, but it's too far of a drive. I'm so pleased that you can call and order ahead and pick them up at the Downtown Public Market. The vegetarian and vegan options are awesome.I've had their Mushroom, Corn and Spinach Tamales and the Polano Chile and Cheese which are both equally scrumptious.But buyer beware, one tamale may not be enough and you will be severely tempted to buy a few more.[Solid 3.5 stars]Not your ordinary tamales.  These are large moist and fresh.  I first encountered them at the Phoenix Public Market on Saturdays and occasionally on First Fridays, with steamers full of a variety of tamale flavors to please the Vegan, Vegeterian and meat lover alike.  With fillings from traditional Pork Red Chile and Beef Red Chile to Spinach Mushroom, Shrimp, Chicken (red or green)  or my favorite Green Chile, Corn with Cream cheese.  You have to check out their menu of choices they always seem to have something new or seasonal.  They have them warm in steamers or frozen to take home for later.  [They defrost and reheat very well.  Reheat in the wrap or wrap a moist paper towel over the wrapped tamale to ensure it won't dry out.]A fan of their moist delicious fluffy masa, I am not a fan of the shrimp tamale I had and the tamale traditionalist part of me found that the Pork Red Chile had too much cumin for my flavor.  I can always count on the goodness of the Green Corn Tamale (Corn, green chile and cream cheese).When I forget to pick up a few on Saturday I can always find them in the freezer at Phoenix Public Market.I was inspired by Michael's Review of the Day yesterday to write on Tamale Store, because quite frankly I haven't had any lately because we just exited the official Mexican tamale season AKA, the three months where every hispanic relative in the state makes gazillions of dryish to OK tamales and you have to eat them because you are related and they think theirs are the best on the planet, so you better tell them they are or they are going to smack you on the back of the head- season of good cheer.But back to the task at hand. Tamale store. We were introduced to them at the begining of last year on a day trip up to Payson, where we noticed they had just started up a Farmer's Market in the Chili's parking lot on Highway as you enter town. Heck yes, we decided to stop. Lots of great stuff there, you should definitely check it out, but most notably were the tamales! I claim tamale tasting expertise based on the 27 years of consumption,and yes these are Fantastic. I became a rabid fan of their green corn, red beef, chicken chipotle. And I will never pass up any opportunity to buy these scrumptious moist delicacies.Beside the amazing tamales, the staff is INCREDIBLE. They taste out their tamales to everyone that wants some, and bags up the orders with a true awesome love for what they do. They are very helpful and informative for the tamale retarded and find the flavor that you are going to love. They have veggie and vegan options which are great. And they sell out fast. The girl told me later in the season on another visit, that they always sell out in Payson, so if you go to this market, head to this booth early. They drive up from Cave Creek, so what they have for that day is IT.Don't pass this place up.Oh, P.S. In case you were wondering....way WAY better than anything my family made this "tamale season"  (luckily none of them have any clue what Yelp means)I like how you can buy assorted tamales by the dozen.I love tamales, so when I saw this place on Yelp, I knew I had to try it. The draw for me, besides the rating, was the selection - several types of tamales including a couple vegetarian, vegan, and dessert options. There's something for everyone! Their website also boasts, "NO lard, shortening, gluten, preservatives, MSG, soy, trans fats, high fructose corn syrup, or junk here." Fabulous!You can place an order via telephone, e-mail, or form on their website. I really like the convenience of the electronic options and it ensures there's no miscommunication on your order. They recommend placing your order within 24-48 hours. I placed mine a day in advance and everything went very smoothly. I used e-mail and received a prompt response.The interaction at the store was just as painless as the ordering process. The store was easy to find with the large "TAMALES" on the plaza's street sign. It's a cute shop with a counter and comfortable seating. It took a couple minutes to locate our order in the back, then we paid and that was it! The tamales are sold in sets of two, sealed, and labeled. I was really impressed with the packaging! We ordered two dozen and they were frozen for pick-up, which was great. Prices: Pack (2) is $5.50, 1/2 Dozen is $16, and 1 Dozen is $28. You're obviously getting the better deal with the dozen. The price difference is not vast (42 cents per tamale between the pack and dozen costs), but for each dozen, that's $5 in savings!Heating instructions: Microwave frozen tamale wrapped in damp paper towel for four minutes (with wax paper and corn husk intact) OR steam frozen tamale for 35-40 minutes on medium heat (with wax paper and corn husk intact). I used the microwave option and it worked perfectly!The moment of truth: How do they taste? Well, I'm sure you already guessed from my five-star rating that I'm in love. THEY'RE AMAZING! We started with the Pork Red Chile, which I was most excited since I LOVE adobada sauce and it exceeded my expectations. The masa is moist and very flavorful, all their meats (chicken, beef, pork) are tender, and the amount of sauce is perfect. Oh my gosh, the FLAVOR!! We also had Chicken Chipotle, Chicken Green Chile, Beef Red Chile, Tex-Mex, and Poblano Chiles & Monterey Jack. We really liked the flavor of the Chicken Chipotle and there's a little kick. Their chile verde is so, so good! I can't believe I missed Chicken Mole on the menu, so that's on my list for the next order! Favorites: Pork Red Chile, Chicken Green Chile, and Chicken Chipotle. I REALLY like the red chile, so I'm sure all the meat options taste great in it. I didn't care for the Tex-Mex one, so I'd pass on that.I will definitely be ordering more tamales during my future trips to Arizona! Oh yes, they traveled the 300 miles well and we are still enjoying them.

This was my first All You Can Eat Sushi (AYCES) experience, so I don't have much to compare to in that department. From what friends told me, however, the price is good at $25 a person, which include tea/soda, miso soup, and salads. Also, from what I understand, the AYCES "rules of the house" are on par with other places. We had a group of about 16 people and the restaurant accommodated us quite well. Surprisingly, service was prompt, especially given our large party. Drinks came out within a reasonable amount of time (and the drinks are cheap!!). Miso and salads came out quickly. The sushi itself was tasty and fresh, but not the best that I've eaten in my lifetime.AYCES rules - each person can order 2 rolls or 10 pieces of sashimi at a time. One must eat all of said pieces before ordering more. If any specialty rolls or sashimi are left on the plate at the end of the meal, you get charged for them. AYCES Survival TIP: Go with a group!!! If you don't like something that you ordered, someone else will! If you don't finish a roll, someone else will! For all that we ordered, not a bad price at $25 a pop. They even let us bring home the specialty rolls that we did not eat (and were charged for). I was so full that I probably won't want sushi for another year, but I would recommend the experience at least once in a lifetime.

Terrasse Lafayette has a wide sunny patio on a leafy residential street in the Plateau Mile End area, and specializes in large portions of generally super satisfying Canadian comfort food. These days we don't live next door so we're more likely to order in than mosey down, and our order of choice is usually the Lafayette Special lasagne (or switch the noodles for penne or whatever you prefer.) It's oven-baked, the regular size is mega, and the large has got enough cheese, mushrooms, pepperoni, bacon, smoked meat, green peppers to get you through a couple of those long, cold Canadian evenings well fed. Bonus - one time when they were particularly busy and our order took a long while to arrive they immediately offered us a gift certificate for our next order. Very thoughtful and much appreciated!

Review Text :
Just a quick review about some take out Cheesecake from this place......My husband and I went by this restaurant last night to try some of their cheesecake that we heard 'Is To Die For!'We walked in and were greeted by the friendly bartender who told us for take out just go to the back where the cash register was and they could help us with our order.  First off, the ambiance for this place is really nothing to write home about and is very boring.  So we weren't impressed with that aspect of it. Like I said before, the bartender was nice, but I can't say the same for the guy at the cash register!He was rude.  No greeting, no smile, and seemed bothered that we were only ordering the Cheesecake to go.  We even told him that we heard that the cheesecake was 'To Die For', and he didn't even blink.....he took our payment and said, 'It'll be up in a minute'......I wanted to come back at another time and try and entree or more, but not now.Service is a HUGE part of a business, and the service here made this customer not want to ever come back to this place again. We also will not be recommending this place to any of our friends or family.....As for the cheesecake.....My husband liked it, but I've had better!Vegas Yelpers, you all have way too low standards! I can't trust your recommendations here!I went here with my husband and some of his coworkers and it was definitely below mediocre across the board.Food:With great food, I can overlook just about all other aspects of a dining experience. Unfortunately, Off The Strip did not have great food (or even good for that matter). The ingredients and preparations were all things I could make at home. Nothing was very innovative, although many dishes were overly complex with the addition of a ton of ingredients. I think an effective dish embraces simplicity and transforms minimal ingredients rather than adds a truckload. In addition, a pet peeve of mine is when restaurants don't disclose on the menu or by the waiter what will show up on my plate and this place was a major offender of that. (I don't need the secret recipe; I'm just looking for an idea of major flavors and ingredients!)For example, the Caesar salad dressing was so strongly flavored of raw garlic (not even roasted to get the flavor without the "whoo"-factor) that I couldn't eat more than two bites! I LOVE garlic. I eat it raw in slices as I cook; I roast it and have it with a meal; I am obsessed with The Stinking Rose in San Francisco, a restaurant dedicated to the obscene use of garlic; but tons and tons of raw garlic in a Caesar dressing is really just offensive. And to boot, the menu made no mention at all of a garlicy Caesar.Another example of overly complex food without prior warning on the menu was the mashed potatoes. They had crispy pieces of burned cheese surrounding the serving, which I'm not a huge fan of but I know some people like it. But they also had something else in them that I still can't place. It was more of a scent than a flavor, and honestly it smelled like just a hint of artificial vanilla extract, or some sort of pastry like scent. After I pointed it out other people detected it too. I'm still trying to figure it out. Mascarpone? Someone dropped some cheesecake in the mashed potato pan? Some overly ambitious chef attempting vanilla mashed potatoes? Sounds bizarre ...because it was. (And it was another part of my meal I only had a couple bites of.)The "fresh baked bread" was one of those half cooked loaves from the grocery store that you stick in the oven. Fresh... Half baked? Except it was a little stale like it sat under a warmer or something, so maybe just half baked.The crabcakes used really really really low grade crab meat, with not a hint of lump, and possibly a hint of fish. It could just be because I'm from New England but I don't find crabcakes without lump meat even worth eating.The "pesto" garlic bread contained not even a hint of pesto, just more overwhelming garlic.Oh, and their "famous" cheesecake was nothing to write home about.Atmosphere:They need to hire a decorator  or something!! They had bare beige walls with a single painting. (Although I did see two paintings sitting on the ground looking like they needed to be hung.) The place had plain old recessed lighting; cafe tables with cheapo diner style chairs; no booths; and no mirror, no soap, and no towels in the ladies' room.  No ecoutrements in the ladies room would be inexcusable at Denny's but at a place running about $50/person it's awful. Service:First on the good - the male waiter was on the ball. He accidentally brought me the wrong vegetable and corrected his mistake without me pointing it out. He was decently nice and looked professional in a branded shirt.However, the female waitresses seemed like they belonged in a different restaurant entirely. One was wearing just a tanktop, which seemed way inappropriate for a place where many customers were wearing button-downs and nice pants. The other was wearing a glittery PBR hat and selectively called people "hon," which I find even more annoying than calling everyone "hon." The "hons" at the table were me, the only female with our party, and two of the younger guys at our table. When people dress up to come get a steak and pay circa $50 a person, such casual/ unprofessional waitstaff totally doesn't fit.Value:Ugh, just go to the strip. It's bad food, but even if it were good food it wouldn't be worth it.Appetizers run about $15-$20 and are hardly shareable. The rolled New York includes four small pieces; the mussels are scant. My filet mignon was $34. I'm pretty sure that's around what Morton's charges!!My soda was $4!! They have an awful meager selection beer and nothing on tap yet charged my husband $7 for his beer!! Basically, so not worth it.Lobster Ravioli and Chimay Beer... enough said! kudos to the adorable decor and amazing service! i recommend the place to everyone.Food smelled great when we walked in (2 of us), asked for a table, 2 waiters consulted each other, one waiter said it would be a 5 minute wait, just sit at the bar and we'll get you when your tables ready.  Sat at the bar, 1 woman on one end watching TV halfway thru her meal, a couple halfway thru their meal on the other, we chose the middle seats allowing 3 empty chairs either side of us, so we are pretty visible and alarmingly drinkless and menu-less.  Bartender made no eye contact for 10 minutes despite walking back and forth several times serving the already eating diners.  We then saw 3 ladies walk in who also were told to wait at the bar til their table was ready.  So in the ten minutes we were at the bar, those girls who arrived after us were served drinks and handed menus, bar back walked past the bartender who saw we were sitting there awkwardly asked us if we needed anything, told him we were waiting for a table, brought us water, we asked barback for 2 shots honey jack, he told the bartender and went to do his other duties.  So ten minutes after that i watch the bartender make 6 drinks for a waitress, close out the 3 ladies tab AS THE WAITER SAT THEM TO A TABLE, (mind you they came in about 10 minutes after us), still no shots we ordered or eye contact from bartender as he passed us a dozen more times.   So 30 MINUTES LATER, our waiter skipped us and gave away our table, bartender ignores us, 2 different waiters forgets about us, shots ordered forgotten about, we look around for assistance, bartender deems not important to remind staff we've been waiting for a table.  We get up slowly making our way to the door, no one notices us and we leave.Service from bartender: NEGATIVE 10Service from waiter: JUST PLAIN FOR GOT ABOUT US.Service from barback: OUTSTANDING.So if you are a cute couple looking for good service and wanting to eat something, anything, look else where,  if you are 3 nice looking cougars, don't worry, the staff will easily ignore waiting patrons and skip the others before you and seat you priority.  NEVER COMING BACK, don't like being ignored and forgotten.   Garlic bread did smell good though. (Don't know if that's on the menu because never received one.)The food is way too salty. We didn't even touch the meatloaf after the first bite. The service is welcoming but slow. If it is not one of the very few selections at this local area, I wouldn't come and I won't come back as well.

My wife and I delayed our birthday dinner (ours are just a couple weeks apart) and finally went last night.  It's been a while since we've been to Fleming's so we were both looking forward to it.We had reservations and were seated promptly.  LeAnn was our server and she was awesome.  She recommended the Eponymous Cab.  It was pricey at $20 per glass.  But worth it.  Nice, well balanced cab.We started off with the toasted mushroom ravioli.  Delicious.  Filled with tender mushrooms with a butter porcini sauce.  How to get all the sauce?  How about that mini loaf of sourdough they bring you!  We both ordered filet.  My wife ordered the porcini crusted filet and I had the main filet.  Both medium.  We ordered the garlic mash and roasted baby carrots.The steaks- cooked perfectly.  The manager came over a couple minutes after we cut them to make sure they were to our satisfaction.  They were.  I had a side of peppercorn sauce with mine as well.  Fantastic.The sides- the mash was nothing special.  But those carrots?  WOW!  Don't think of grocery store carrots when you think baby carrots.  Not even close.  The carrots were roasted with golden raisins and slivered almonds.  Those could have been the best part of the meal if I wasn't such a steak lover!  LeAnn gave us a complimentary box of chocolate truffles as well.The food was fantastic but the service was above and beyond.  We will definitely be back!Crème de la crème experience!The 5 for $6 happy hour at the bar is nothing short of fantastic.  What does 5 for $6 exactly mean?  As I found out, it means they have 5 options of food or drinks for $6 each.  Happy hour ends at 7pm.The drinks and food are superb.  I tried the burger and brie puff and they were very tasty and filling.  The service was also exemplary.I am an instant fan of Fleming's and will be a return customer.We have dinned at the Scottsdale Fleming, it was excellent service and outstanding food.  I was so dissapointed that this Glendale location does not measure up!  The decor and atompshere is there but just not the same.  Looks like it, doesn't feel like it.  We were greeted immedately and seated as our reserved table for 6 (Saturday night - before Mother's day).  The wine list was fancy (electronic tablet).  Our server was just NOT attentive at ALL and made the experience basically SUCK.-She never mentioned the specials for the day (the list on laying on the table, someone discovered it later)-She brought the wrong beverage-She has to come back to ask was we ordered because she couldn't read her handwriting-Never was around to grab her attentionNow to the food, two of our group stressed that they needed they meats cooked well done.  One of the filet mignons was to be butterflied to make sure it is well done and the other sliced filet migon was to be well done.  Well, the ladies got their filets and they are still oozing blood.  Come on a butterflied filet migon and a SLICED filet migon not well done?  Really???  Especially on the sliced one, when you slice it and see blood and pink = NOT well done.  We had to send the 2 plates back.  The guest of honor had to sit was watch some of start to eat.  Don't get me wrong, my steak was perfect and tasted great.  You are a steakhouse, getting steaks cooked to the right temperature is your forte!  I am surprised that a Manager was not send out to appoloize or at least talk to the table when we had to send back 2 of the 6 main entrees.  He came by at the end to do a quick hello and how was everything...  Well, it sucked but nothing you can do now at this point!Came here for the first time with some lovely ladies for steak and cocktails after work one night and it was amazing!What can I say about such a superb place?  Our waitress was the most cheerful and sweetest lady ever.  Even when we were mulling and being indecisive over which cocktails to get, she gave friendly suggestions on what's delicious [she has excellent recommendations --- I wish I remember her name].  We all had the prime rib and every steak came out cooked perfectly.  Not exactly up to Mr. W's steak-perfection but the closest thing to a perfectly cooked steak prepared by another person.  Even though we wandered in a little after 9PM on a weekday, we were given such great service and a really satisfying meal.  I would definitely be back!My brother and I were in the mood for a good steak and came to Fleming's.  The place was crowded but we managed to get a table in the bar area.  The ambiance:  typical steak house wood and leather.  Pretty and warm.  The service:  Our server was very good. Once or twice we kind of felt like we had been forgotten and our server admitted that she thought we had been taken care of, but generally it was really good.The food:  We got the special which was a filet and vegetables.  We ordered some extra mashed potatoes on the side.  I have to say that I have had better steak.  It was not as tender as I would have expected and the flavor was seriously lacking.  My brother asked me halfway through the meal what I thought and, being tactful and not wanting to make him feel that this wasn't such a great choice, I pointed out the positives.  He said he was underwhelmed. Gotta say that we both pretty much thought we had much higher expectations for the price point and the reputation.  I have been to other Fleming's and felt I had better food.  The vegetables and potatoes were good but not fabulous.  Fleming's, you didn't wow me on this trip.  Maybe next time...Would have liked to rate this better.  But they closed before the closing time, and as I pulled the door for my wife, I discovered it was locked.  Someone looked at me through the door, turned and walked away.  Not even a "we're closed", probably because they knew it was before 10:30.  This was on June 26.  So we didn't have an opportunity to eat there.  And it's unlikely we'll come back.  Actually, I'm quite sure we won't.So we made the best of it and went next door to BJ's, and had a fantastic dinner there.   Granted, it was our anniversary and we were eating deep dish pizza, but we've been together long enough to roll with it and our waiters there was fantastic, personable and offered great suggestions.I'm sure the West Valley will have more steakhouses soon, and we'll try those out as they arrive.  Really poor show, Flemings.We were introduced by our host to two waiters who evidently forgot their GPS at home, because they couldn't find their way back to our table.  After being there for over 1.5 hours, we finally received our food (and only after reminding the staff that we weren't sitting there because we love their carpet and think they just have the darnest chairs in the world).We were not asked if we wanted a wine refill until the 1.5 hour mark when we also asked them for the whereabouts of our food.  We received our food shortly thereafter, despite putting in our orders within 15 minutes of being seated.  There was no apology or explanation for why our food took so long, despite the tables around us being empty.  Our waters were only refilled once.  If not for the amazing company I was with, I would have left at the 1 hour mark.Food wise.. I was not particularly hungry so I ordered a salad and a side dish (lobster tempura) as my main course.  I fully regret asking them to hold on bringing out the salad until everyone received their main dish.My lobster tempura was really meh.  Like, really meh.  It reminded me of state fair food, where you find oreos/junk thrown into a batter of disgusting oil.  The portion for the lobster tails definitely looked big, but the oily crust was 75% of the plate.  Not worth the $27 price tag.  I will say that the portion for the steak looked bigger than advertised -- definitely a plus, but not enough to make up for the non-existent service.

Review Text :
"World's Best Burger?"Not so sure about that... but my first experience at Indulge was ok.I actually was supposed to meet a friend for dinner at Indulge but because of a long story involving her boyfriend's car being broken into and him having to file a police report from her apartment, I ended up calling in our order and taking it to her place 'to-go.'Our order was pretty simple.  My friend ordered the turkey burger without cheese, sour cream on the side.  I ordered a burger salad... 1/3 lb burger cooked medium, with jalapenos, tomatoes, sprouts, dill pickle chips, and sauteed mushrooms... with balsamic dressing on the side.  I also ordered a side of sweet potato chips... I love sweet potato everything!Well, I should've checked the order, because when I opened it up back at her place, I realized they did not include the sour cream or balsamic dressing... the pickle chips were actually pickle slices, and the sweet potato chips were actually sweet potato fries.  Just a bit off...Still edible and pretty tasty, but I hate when a simple order gets screwed up like that.  Anyways, I'm sure I'll give Indulge another shot sometime - probably better to dine in next time... that way, if they forget anything, you can flag down your server until they get it right.  It's a cute place - centrally located on the south west corner of Scottsdale and Shea.For those of you who don't follow me on Twitter (which will, in the not too distant future, probably be mandatory...we must all follow each other...the snake will eat its own tail:), I'm on a  nearly constant quest to find the best burgers!I wander far and wide (generally wider, as opposed to farther:)My search took me the exotic clime's of Near North Scottsdale at Shea Boulevard and Scottsdale Road.I guess, truth be told, it wasn't so much a search this time, as it was convenient to BevMo...The Beautiful Carin and I were restocking some of our bar...they don't sell Bunnahabhain and 21 year old Glenlivet at Costco:)And there it was, Indulge Burgers and More...beckoning through the exhaust haze in the parking lot.This seems to be the "and More" strip mall..."Beverages and More"..."Indulge Burgers and More"..."Pet Market and More"..."Chase Bank and More"...you get the idea:)My question (and I always have one:) is "more what"?My personal preference would be for "more cowbell"...how I miss Blue Oyster Cult! :-)We stashed our little liquid treasures in the trunk (taking extra care not to bruise the scotch:) and walked in.Indulge's strong suit is not atmosphere...it's a nice enough space, nicely decorated, clean and bright, but it's in that little strip mall at Shea and Scottsdale...not a great spot to sit out on the patio and watch the world go by, while you enjoy your burger.And you probably will enjoy your burger...Indulge has some pretty decent burgers:)They have a "set menu" as well as the oh so au courant "build your own burger" menu for your dining pleasure:)Our server was sweet as pie and took the time to explain what was included, what was optional (pretty much everything, as near as I could tell) and how the process works:)We decided to create our own burgers...Angus Beef for me and grilled chicken for Carin.You can add more toppings than a normal bun could possibly hold and make yourself one of those freakish Food Network "Worlds Best Burger" competition kind of things (you know what I mean...Frisbee size patty,  1/2 pound of bacon and gorgonzola, apricots, arugula, avocado, cactus, sprouts, peppers, carrots...well, the list goes on and on and on:)Another words, enough other crap to completely kill the taste of the burger, if that's your aim:)But why would you?These are pretty decent burgers all by themselves...1/3 or 2/3 lbs. of great angus beef (I was born and raised on a cattle ranch and we raised...that's right, black angus cattle...delicious black angus cattle...so I've always had a bias for angus beef:)Cheese, tomatoes, lettuce and pickles are all you really need, and they are fresh and included with your burger:)Add in fries and onion strings and I'm usually a pretty happy camper.Best burger or chicken sandwich in town?...Best Patio?...Best Ambience or Service?No, unfortunately...but better than most and probably deserving of the title "Best Upscale Burger Joint Next to Where I Buy my Booze"That's good enough to make me stop when I'm at the crossroads and restocking the bar:)I was skeptical but the reviews were strong and the Groupon was good so what the heck.  It just seemed like an overly simple concept for a pricey cheeseburger.  I think I was expecting a burger somewhere between a Friday's burger and a Burger King burger.What I got was an awesome burger.  Tender, juicy, quality beef.  I ordered the do it yourself 1/3 pound burger with blue cheese, grilled peppers, grilled onions, grilled pineapple and an apricot chipoltle sauce.  I was hungry and I have to say that I tore up that sumbitch in no time flat.They brought out some freshly made potato chips while we waited.  It did seem like the burger took awhile.  Did I mention it was really good?  The fries are pretty average.  I preferred the onion thins.  Yummy.Service was great and our server somehow started telling us about her recent dinner at Ruth's Chris Steakhouse.  I think the point of the story was that the onion thins were better at Indulge than the onion rings at Ruth's Chris.Well, it was just OK. Large portion? Yes. Friendly service? Yes. Indulgent satisfaction? No. I recently met a friend at Indulge for lunch - armed with a groupon that was burning a hole in my pocket!  While we agreed the restaurant concept was good and the service was friendly and attentive, neither of us was overly impressed with the food.  And food is really what we go to restaurants for, isn't it? Armed with our build-your-own-burger menus and little miniature golf pencils, we filled in bubbles (SAT flashback anyone?) and selected 2/3 lb beef burgers with all of the basic things (cheese, lettuce, tomato, etc.) as well as grilled onions. We also opted for a side of sweet potato fries (the & More part of our meal!). The burgers were impressively large, but unfortunately soggy. The beef was not tantalizing juicy, but greasy. Also, the grilled onions had been placed directly on the bottom bun, so it was wet and mushy making the burger difficult to hold. The fries, served with a side of ranch dressing, were average. In my world, a burger should be constructed a certain way, from bottom to top, so it does not end up squishy and messy (is my Type A showing? Yep!): - bottom bun - meat - cheese - extra items (i.e. grilled onions, mushrooms, bacon, etc.) - lettuce - top bun I am somewhat biased, as I grew up with a father who loved to grill and could make beautiful, beautiful burgers. Indulge, while not bad, was not what I was looking for. So, my quest for that juicy (and structurally sound) burger of my dreams continues.09/08/11Great place for gourmet burgers, but pricey!  I was in the area, returning an item at Bev Mo', when I noticed that the burger place I'd been reading about from so many Yelp friends was right next door.  I had just noticed a Now! Groupon deal that morning where $12 bought $20 worth of food there, so I went in and had a look at the menu and decided that the groupon deal was worth checking out.Looking at the happy hour menu, I see that it's 3:30p-6:30p Sundays (beer /wine) and Mondays (domestic beer/sliders) and 4p-close Ladies' Night Tuesdays and Wednesdays (1/2 off apps and drinks).  I'll have to check HH on a Wednesday soon!After poring over the menu for a few minutes and asking lots of questions (organic and local produce and meats are used whenever possible), I decided to customize a Kobe burger w/ gruyere, mixed greens, sprouts, grilled onions, and pepperoncini, on an oatmeal-topped wheat bun, with an apricot chipotle sauce.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bk4FIHt8ODRBPfqL4Fd2aQ?select=7HkjJq2083qp9TxBduhkTw  I upgraded to sweet potato fries for an extra charge.  Sounds great, right?  And it was!  Loved everything on my plate!!  The bun is from a local bakery and made fresh everyday; the veggies were either locally-sourced or organic; and the beef used here are all-natural (no hormones and not GMO).  The sweet potato fries were perfect!!  And the sauce!!  Very tasty- sour-sweet from the apricots, and very spicy!!  http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=M9rRM6Eo5YbKLKMG5QiIPA&select=x6pvF_xqhv5mseBAvyEV6g  I also tried the Mac 'n cheese, w/ ham (extra fee).  Very, very cheesy, and very, very good!  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bk4FIHt8ODRBPfqL4Fd2aQ?select=R2QAn4cH5v9Is0CtRpTvewDecided to skip on the apps, but what do we have here?  Complimentary homemade parmesan potato chips!  Next time, I'll have to check out one of the "adult" milkshakes and remember to make room for dessert!  :))Can't report on the noise level, since it was pretty sleepy indoors when I stopped in at 345p.  The place looks like it picks up a bit later at night, though... The servers were a bit too cool for my tastes-- warm up the room w/ a few smiles and courtesy, please!03/14/12I had a couple of groupons to use up, so on this visit I decided to try Indulge's chili-and-cheese fries, their chili (to go), and their adult coffee milkshake.  The fries came out fast, and even though they were very greasy (as to be expected), the few crispy bites I had were sufficient while I waited for my to-go burgers to arrive.  (I ended up throwing out 4/5 of the fries entree.)  Some of the burgers I'd ordered were missing some toppings (cheese and other toppings I chose by checking those boxes on the order forms the server hands you to fill out), and of the four burgers I asked to be cooked medium, three were actually either medium-well or well-done.  (The only one cooked to medium was the burger I had tried at the restaurant.)  The best part of my experience here today was the coffee milkshake!  It was made with vanilla ice cream, Adult chocolate milk (you may buy a bottle at Bev Mo or Total Wine, I'm told), coffee, and Kahlua, and it's only $8.   http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bk4FIHt8ODRBPfqL4Fd2aQ?select=PGuZSDEwBBFrORLlSgEz7gI say skip the burgers and apps here and just go for a milkshake!I had the feeling that Indulge (and the staff) do not appreciate their guests that use groupons.  My server was initially helpful with my questions, but when it finally dawned on her that I was using a groupon, the initial warm service turned definitely chilly.  And why not?  She was guaranteed to make around 18-20% tip (around $20 for a pre-tax food value of around $109)!  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bk4FIHt8ODRBPfqL4Fd2aQ?select=9RBD09ksq3s1RfxZVIRvnQhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bk4FIHt8ODRBPfqL4Fd2aQ?select=uKfvo5vvQcd6JzoJPeLpNQ03/16/12I had one more groupon to use, so I met a friend here for dinner, and somewhat reluctantly at that, since I knew the service wasn't going be anything special.  (And I was right!  Even my friend made an observation, "I don't think our server likes me very much."  I told him later it's bec. she knew she was going to make an easy $20...)The deal came with a couple of apps, four burgers, and a bottle of wine, so we placed our order for the burgers, and I chose sweet potato fries (to go), as well as the Mac 'n cheese app, but not before I asked our server (the same one I had two days ago) if I could order the side of mac 'n cheese as an app (it fell within the price specification for the apps included in the groupon deal).  Our server said yes.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bk4FIHt8ODRBPfqL4Fd2aQ?select=ygY8t5CvOJsB_aHFQUyvrg  Turned out, the dish wasn't included in the deal, so I still had to choose another app to take home (the parmesan chips that used to be complimentary, and that which I had mentioned in my first Indulge review).The burgers we had at the restaurant were good, even though mine came out medium-well, instead of medium.  The other two burgers I took to-go were medium-well (I specified medium), but at least these weren't missing any toppings this time.  (Funny how I was reduced to counting my lucky stars on having *some* of the order specifications heeded when ALL should've been guaranteed as per the order sheet filled out...)I won't be returning to Indulge anymore, as I did not appreciate the less-than-above-average guest service and sub-par food given on these two visits.  I don't know why some businesses that participate in these groupon events end up offering less-than-stellar service and products when I know they can do so much better.  The goal is to bring in and develop a larger fan/customer base, so this is when you should shine!  I used to understand why businesses added the gratuity (to keep the servers from being under-tipped), but I usually tip 20% (and even much more if the service was over-and-above what I expected), but to see my hard-earned money greedily taken while my guest and I end up with sub-par service AND products, it makes me sick to further recommend this establishment to others.From four stars to one... I have aunts and a cousin who enjoyed their food here a long time ago, but I won't be taking them, nor anyone else, here again!!My girlfriend does not eat gluten so we decided to try Indulge for lunch as they had a very extensive gluten free menu. I had every intention on buying a carnivore burger, however decided to try a veggie burger instead. If the name of the restaurant has "BURGER" in it, I am assuming a burger of the veggie variety would be fine as well. I even asked the server if it was a good veggie burger or if I should order something else, she said "We have VERY good veggie burgers...." Cough, riiiiight.  Our server was very prompt and friendly and suggested, if we were going to order fries off the gluten free menu, we should do so early as they take longer to prepare, so we ordered them in advance(baked not fried).  She came back to take our actual order and not 3 minutes later brought out the fries before the burgers. Ok, a bit early, fine by me. The fries were soft in many places and burnt in others. I thought there were, "MEH", my girlfriend thought they were gross. A little while later my veggie burger was served! - a shriveled up cow-pie slapped between two buns with leaf of lettuce and onion perched on top. A pickle and some carrot shreds garnished the plate. The server saw my confused expression and said, "Oh we don't put anything on the veggie burger, but if you want some ketchup or mustard?" Seriously? No aioli? No spread? No hummus? or anything to damped down this dried up patty of cardboard?!  I ate half of it, primarily because it kept falling apart (nothing was used as a binder apparently), I had to eat it with a fork, but a spoon would have been better. It was so bad, I would have prefered one of those frozen Bocca or Morning Star veggie patties. For $9 it was such a joke. My girlfriend's gluten free burger was a $12 burger on a salad. She asked for guacamole and asked if she should write it on the "build your own burger" menu pad they give you. The server said, "nope I will remember." Guess who forgot the guac. Her burger looked lackluster and somehow a dill pickle on a salad seemed wrong. Frankly, I'd rather Indulge elsewhere.

Review Text :
After two visits to Metro Brasserie, I feel like I've experienced enough to write a review... My first visit was for the Yelp Adopt-A-Family UYE, (kudos to Metro for hosting and giving us a sampling of many of your fine French menu items).  We had fun that night... highlights in my eyes were the the Gin Fizz cocktail that Ty L ordered - he allowed many of us to sample it and it was delicious!  (I'm not even a gin drinker).  I also enjoyed the flatbread and fried oysters.  Great wine selection too!After the UYE, a few of us stayed for dinner - while I really enjoyed the vegetable salad, the cod was not amazing (maybe it was the preparation with the leeks that I was not a fan of, but so be it - I know not to order that next time!)  I will say a major standout for all of us was the beignets - OMG!  Served warm with dipping sauce, these are a must order when you visit Metro!I returned for brunch the following Sunday, and let me tell you - brunch is the way to go!  Between Jared and I, we had three menu items.  I went with the egg white omelette (served with mushrooms, spinach, tomato, and gruyere cheese) - I chose grits as my side and they were even better than the grits I remember eating when I lived in the South!  He had steak and eggs and the quiche.  We both cleaned our plates.  Fresh squeezed grapefruit juice and coffee also made appearances at our table.  Both were great, but a tip to Metro - I prefer my grapefruit juice without ice next time!Jason was our server for brunch, Chad was our server for dinner, and GM Bill was friendly and helpful as always...  I like the shirts that the waiters wear - go check 'em out!  I know I'll be returning for brunch again real soon.  Maybe I'll see you there!Hostess: Would you like to sit inside or outside?Me: OUTSIDE! I'm from Chicago!Hostess: In the sun or in the shade?Me: In the SUN! I'm from Chicago!And that's how our lunch began at Metro Brasserie on a warm February day.  You Phoenix yelpers don't know how lucky you are to be able to wear short-sleeves in February!!I'm not really a fan of French food and find it too heavy for lunch, but I can usually find something to eat on any menu.  And that something to eat at Metro Brasserie was the chicken salad sandwich served on a croissant.  Our waiter told me it was one of their more popular sandwiches. Gabi K ordered a chick pea/eggplant sandwich, while the 3rd member of our party went with the turkey/cranberry sandwich.About 20 minutes later the turkey/cranberry sandwich arrived, but there was no sign of our meals for another 15 or so minutes. Our waiter apologized profusely and said he didn't know why it was taking so long.  I was about to eat my arm by now (being on Chicago time it felt like an hour later), but we waited and waited and waited very patiently.Once our food FINALLY arrived I really enjoyed the chicken salad sandwich...especially cause it was very light on the mayo. I hate mayo...ick.  Gabi really liked her sandwich as well, although the turkey/cranberry sandwich went untouched because the 3rd member of our party was not such a fan.  At the end of the meal our waiter offered to bring us complimentary chocolate cake to make up for the wait of our food, but we declined...these hips do not need anymore chocolate cake.  Still, it was a sweet gesture.Overall It was probably more of a 3 star experience, but I"m feeling a bit generous...the Arizona sun will do that to ya!More to come from the 5 other yelpers in my party who had the same experience as I did.  I just wanted to beat them all to the punch.  To sum up what they will say in what I'm sure will be great detail:1. The good-not-great, reasonably priced brunch food was totally betrayed by the most inept service of all time.  2. Now reading a bunch of other reviews here I see this isn't an uncommon story.3.  Most of the drinks we had were good, including bloody maries, but make your own mimosas by buying champagne and a side glass of OJ."Excuse me waiter. What's this fly doing in my soup?" "It appears to be doing the backstroke sir." Yep. This pretty much sums up our service at MB this past Sunday. Forgotten entrees. No ice bucket for the champagne. Drinks took forever, if indeed, they were remembered. Ketchup? Our beniets? Ugh! Formerly the FoodBar (remember that place, with the awful layout and crazy ordering procedure?), MB is a lovely French restaurant in the heart of Oldtown. We sat inside, luckily, as some Gen X Jewel type performer was on the patio "singing" and strumming her guitar. I heard just a few bars and wanted to stab my eye out with a hot fork. Fortunately the hustle and bustle inside perfectly drowned it out! The food was quite good. Not incredible. Beniets were undercooked a bit, but hey, we scarfed them down anyway. My eggs Benedict was fantastic; served with biscuits instead of English muffins. But no potatoes. No salad. No nothing on the side. Not even a garnish. Others seemed pleased with a burger, granola and an all American breakfast. Christine is right however, in that we were there to celebrate a birthday. Too bad much of our energy was used to flag down ANYONE who could help us. I swear I almost asked the lady sitting next to us to refill Rickie's coffee. God that would have been fun! So I can't say oui oui to MB quite yet. And for now I shall just say ta ta!Go! Go Quickly! We went last night for Yelp Easts and EVERYTHING practically is on the Yelps Eats menu. My husband and I both started out with the onion tart, my friend had the escargot and her husband had the pate. The tart was fabulous and huge (perfect size for a light lunch). The escargot were a bit of a disappointment. Nothing bad but not as good as she hoped. The pate appetizer came as two slices rather than just one, a very generous portion. We all tried it and it was good (and it's made in-house). For our entree my friend and I each ordered the scallops, my husband ordered the duck and my friend's husband got the steak frites. The scallops were phenomenal. They came on a bed of house made organic creamed corn. Delicious to the last bite. My husband loved his duck. It was pounded thin and panko crusted and served on a bed of horseradish spaetzle. Granted, he loves anything panko crusted, but he did say the duck was good. I had a bite, but the panko crust turned me off (I dislike anything panko crusted). The steak frites was a huge portion and so delicious and bloody. For dessert we each ordered something different. I had the macaroon, my husband got the blueberry tart, my friend ordered the beignets and her husband ordered the sticky toffee pudding. Everyone thoroughly enjoyed their desserts. Mine (the macaroons) came layered with two different kinds of mousses - dark chocolate and maybe caramel. It got a little too sweet towards the end, but it's dessert. Par for the course. The beignets came a huge pile of them with three sauces (one of them nutella!). I will definitely come back here again and I'd like to try breakfast here too. The food was great and the atmosphere near perfect (they need to ditch the TVs - they really don't belong there). Our next Yelp Eats meal at Digestif has a lot to measure up to now.10/15Popped in for a late lunch constituting of an Alsatian onion tart and a glass of wine.  I stopped by during happy hour, which meant the tart was $7 (orig. $9), and $2 off glasses of wine.  Bartender Jimmy was kind enough to give me samples of two reds and a rose, before I decided on a Riesling, instead.  Enjoyed the generous pour, which was later added to when Jimmy accidently knocked the decanter down when we shook hands :)  The tart came out a little burnt, and the gruyere was replaced with a milder "fromage blanc," but overall, it still made for a very tasty lunch/dinner!  Photos will prove that I ate at least 5.5 slices.  Read my lips: I ATE THE WHOLE THING.Happy hour apps menu include onion soup gratin, country pate, escargots, onion tart, and a frisee salad for about $2 less than standard menu.  $5 IPAs, $3 off wine cocktails (reg. $10), and $2 off glasses of wine.  (I'm sure there are discounts on drafts and bottles, too, but since I'm not a beer-drinker, I didn't make a special note of this.)  I hope more food will be added to the menu.  Sad news: the toffee sticky pudding has been omitted from the current menu, with no hope of it coming back again.  (Strange that, since Jimmy said it was a very popular dessert.)  The crowd this Monday afternoon was very thin (4:00'ish)- a couple of tables outside, and me at the bar.  A man sat at a table behind me waiting for his date, and another man who recently relocated from San Fran sat a couple of seats from me later on.  Looks like a decent wine list.  Another HH special- a complimentary cheese plate ($18 value) accompanies each bottle of wine ordered (prices range from $30 and up)!I had bookmarked this place because I had read a review that said at the happy hour, which runs 3 to 6 p.m. including Saturday and Sunday, "Oysters are only $1 each and all wines by the glass are $2 off, but guests can linger of a complimentary cheese plate if they purchase a full-priced bottle of wine. And this is one of the best, biggest, most elegant cheese plates in the city. I swear I have tried most of them," which I incorrectly attributed to a fellow Yelper but, really, had read in a MetroMix post on AzCentral, so I should not be too surprised that the cheese plate was WEAK and IF I had paid for it I would have been VERY disappointed: 3 slices of smoked gouda, 6 slices of white American and two thin squares of Blue. There was a mound of fruit relish (I'm guessing currants, though our server never did confirm) and a splash of preserve (guessing strawberry, but it had no real purpose any way, except to decorate the plate). The toasted bread that accompanied the cheese plate was good and there were inexpensive options for bottles, which I had not anticipated. That said, the oysters really were only $1 each and though not a connoisseur, I thought they tasted fresh and delicious and that WAS confirmed by my happy hour companions who do consider themselves connoisseurs. So, my point: happy hour is good here. Go for the oysters. Skip the cheese plate. You can do better sampling at the deli counter at Fry's.I slept in today and worked up an appetite doing some shopping and socializing at the Old Town Farmers Market.  It was after 12 noon when I realized I was starving since I hadn't eaten breakfast.  (I realize this may be normal for some, but this is rare for me - I eat breakfast every day!)Jared and I wanted to stay in the area and we finally agreed to head over to Metro.  We had Minnie with us, so we planned on sitting outside.  Unfortunately, despite having a patio, Metro does not allow dogs.  We ended up having Minnie sit right outside the barrier to the patio while we sat at the table right inside the barrier and we took turns going out to keep her company.  Needless to say, this was not the most relaxing brunch, but we were starving and didn't want to head elsewhere!Jared had the oatmeal and I had the egg white omelette with cheese grits and wheat toast.  I'm still a fan of the breakfast/brunch at Metro more than lunch or dinner... The service was alright; not overly friendly... and it must've been Bill's day off because we didn't see him either.  Bummer!Bottom line: Metro is a great spot for breakfast in my opinion... but unfortunately, they are not dog-friendly!

Else's is always chill and cozy, dark, yummy and badass in a punk mamma full of community love kind of way. It's at its best in the winter right after a big snow. The small corner it sits on is the perfect place to watch the coordinated massive machine ballet of Montreal snow removal. Nice scotch collection and beers on tap, tasty samosas and nachos and other little snacks - you have to order the eats to get the booze so they are not crazy spectacular but they are delicious, unpretentious and cool just like everyone who works and drinks and writes tucked into this friendly local institution.I've been to many bars in my lifetime all over the world and Else's ranks amongst my ultimate top 5.  There are 'fun' bars and there are 'cheap' bars - but for my overall favourites, Else's is part of an elite circle in my rankings.  My criteria:1) Good selection of whisk(e)y and draft beer2) Unpretentious without being collegiate/divey/hipster - I should be equally comfortable going there in shorts and flip-flops or in a suit - it should be cozy and dark with a relaxed vibe.3) Good for all occasions - suitable for any celebration that entails copious consumption of alcohol or drowning your sorrows by the bar by yourself or drinking for a wake3) Friendly, eclectic and interesting regulars and patrons4) Knowledgeable bartender and staff that clearly love their jobs5) No TVs - NONE.  I don't like sports in my bars.  And music should be in the background and never intrude on conversation.6) Classless and appropriate for all (drinking) agesElse's has all this in spades.  And it's definitely a locals bar being off the Ste-Laurent drag and it was one of the few places in Montreal that allowed me to start a tab (seriously Montrealers - paying per round is lame).  Yes, they are officially licensed as a restaurant (check out the history of licensing struggles on the menu) so you may be asked to order some food to drink here.  But there's a $4 vegetarian pizza on the menu... you know what to do.In a word - this place is comfortable.  I walked in timidly at 10PM expecting to grab a quick pint before calling it a night.  I stumbled out at 3AM with an invite to a rock show, hand-rolled cigarettes, toasting to East Vancouver to someone that lived 3 blocks from me and a few solid recommendations on good hip-hop joints in the city and armed with the knowledge of how to fake a (male) orgasm.  This place is that good - slink in for a bit and you'll comfortably lose a few hours here drinking and bullshitting.  It didn't take long to figure out that no patron here works a 9-5 job - "everyone here is either an artist or has a story" as one of the regulars told me.  So yup, I came back for another visit.If I was living in Montreal, you can call me 'Norm' here.  I'm already homesick for this place.I've been here twice and it always seems like my friends are more impressed by Else's than I am. This by no means lessens my affection for this place (There is this cured fish and cucumber salad dish that makes me feel like I got punched in the mouth with a pack full of flavour! Though I do wish the portion size was MUCH bigger...), but my friends always seem to pick the dish that's a decent portion and delicious (Fish&Chips, Calamari). This one friend said the calamari at their place was the BEST calamari he's ever tasted. Quite the praise if you ask me. Nonetheless, if you're in Montreal and you want to bring your friends to a chill and cozy place with great ambiance,  I think Else's would be a great choice. They have quite a selection of drinks and great food. I'm the type of person where if I happen to recommend a restaurant that my friends like, I always feel like I take full responsibility of the meal as though I'm the chef. Therefore, Else's would probably be my best bet for a great recommendation.

Let's face it all food is subjective.  We like what we like.  Everyone's tastebuds are different.  And Chinese food is one of those things that everyone has an opinion about.  Many here on Yelp abhore the "chain" Chinese establishments.  Not just for taste reasons but for other reasons as well.  I prefer the smaller Chinese places over the "chains" but I also feel the chains have their place too.  Having said that we were out on a Saturday and I was feeling like Chinese so I pulled up the handy dandy Yelp app on my phone and found J & K.  We walked in and waited for just a few minutes while a table was cleared. It was a fairly busy Saturday night.  My daughter loves shrimp.  She would eat shrimp for breakfast, lunch and dinner.  She drools at the mere mention of shrimp. We ordered an appitizer of fried shrimp. 6 beautiful, big, butterfly shrimp.  She was in heaven.  As for me, I love to order different dishes and then take the rest home for lunch or dinner for the next few days.  The garlic chicken was yummy!  So tender and lots of flavor.  I had mu shu pork.  It was served already wrapped in the it's wrapper, like little burritos on the plate.  It was probably some of the best mu shu I've had.  I also got some house special fried rice.  Everything was good.  Service was fast and polite.  Our server brought my daughter some extra wonton chips which she loves.  I enjoyed our meal and the leftovers were just as good the next day.  If you're looking for good chinese, tell them I sent you.  Just remember, it is subjective.  :)

So unassuming on the outside, this place is adorable on the inside.  We went on a rainy and were promptly seated in the jam-packed dining area.  The dining room is small but well decorated with scenes painted on the walls (pagans? jesters?) and candles everywhere.  Our server was a lovely woman who, like everyone in Montreal, turned her French and English on and off with no issues.  She walked through the menu with us and gave us a delicious bruschetta while we chose our meals.  I went simple and had alfredo with shrimp, boy had manicotti.  Both were amazing.  Admittedly the manicotti was a wee bit better but I was not disappointed with my decision at all.  For dessert I opted for the chocolate rum mousse which was lightly sweet and majorly alcoholic.  There was a biscuit of some sort at the bottom the dish that was pure rum-soaked goodness.  Boy had tiramisu which was yummy too but I was honestly concentrating on getting drunk from mine.  Unlike most of the places we went the check arrived shortly after we finished.  I think that this place is so popular they want to turn the table over quickly.  I liked that as we sat waiting for uncomfortably long times at other places (reviews to follow).  I would say this is the best overall meal we had while in Montreal.  La Strega is affordable, friendly, quick and delicious.  You will not be disappointed spending your time and money here.

Restaurant name  Amalfi's Pasta 'n' Pizza
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
After Bill's gushing review, we were in the mood for Italian and decided to check out Amalfi.Side note: "Amalfi" is apparently the correct name of the place (actually Amalfi Italian Cuisine) - and there is a review for "Amalfi", but this isn't it.  "Amalfi's" was entered when the place was created, and has more reviews (3 to 1, soon to be 4 to 1), so I'm putting this here.  I've asked the powers that be to combine them, and we'll see what happens.Anyway - we were impressed with the service.  It was a Sunday night, so things were pretty slow, but the service was friendly, and one area where other places fall flat (keeping the glasses full) was handled deftly here.  They actually fill your glass and then bring you an extra so you can top yourself off in case they don't get back in time.  Rarely does that happen, however, as many times they filled you up with the end of the second one, and then brought you another one of those.  Very impressive.When it came to the food, you could pick up the aroma from the parking lot - they like garlic and plenty of it.  So if you don't, go elsewhere.  There was garlic in the soup (red pepper and roasted garlic), on the bread (garlic knots), on the pizza (to be fair, I asked for it) and on the chicken (in hefty slices).  They probably have a garden of the stuff.  There was surely garlic in the sauces as well - this is just the garlic you could see.Most everything was tasty, only a couple areas fell down.The salad was a fairly wimpy side salad absolutely coated in dressing.  This wouldn't be so bad, but to get it you have to choose between pasta and a salad with your entree.  And if you want both?  It's an extra charge.  To make matters worse, neither the pasta nor the salad is particularly impressive or worth the charge.  As much as I hate a la carte menus, it would be better to take that off the dinner and sell them a la carte so they could do them better.I'll agree with Bill that the pizza crust is pretty good - a nice, thin crust that holds up well.  Unfortunately the pizza itself was a bit off.  I had a "white" pizza that strangely wasn't white.  They could be avoiding Aryan stereotypes or something, I don't know.  But rather than a bunch of cheese, it was a cheese base (ricotta), with another cheese on top (mozzarella, I think), and then a couple of meats (ham and canadian bacon).  I also swapped out the sun-dried tomatoes for fresh garlic.  Now I don't mind the ingredients, and for what they were, it wasn't bad.  It was just strange that it was a white pizza is all, as I'd never had it before.I also ended up dunking it in some of the leftover marinara from the garlic knots and it was a lot better.  I think that if I had chosen a standard pizza (like pepperoni), I'd have liked it better.  Sometimes the unusual choice can backfire, and here it did.We finished up with a dessert, and I can't recall the name.  It was a couple small scoops of ice cream that had a bit of raspberry in the center, and all of it was coated with chocolate.  Pretty tasty really, and a lovely presentation.What a rad little joint. The neon on the windows facing the "street" got my tummy growling as we walked up. Dunno how long these guys have been here but I felt immediately comfy - reminded me of my favorite pizzeria as a kid, except no Galaga.Prices hovered around the super reasonable range on apps, a little high on pie and entrees. But yeah - great crust. Found myself eating it plain, with the pizza, dipping it in various things, sprinkling parm and hot pepper flakes on a plate and wiping, yeah, let's try it with some of that butter, etc. Bread was perfect, hot hot hot, thin crust and soft interior. Bruschetta simple but good. Salad dressing eh.Margherita pie was really good - an interesting line between a street-style NY slice and something fancier. As in, all the crisp-but-chewiness, salt, and grease, but richer flavors. Pasta dish was equally good - ziti and tomato, garlic, smoked mozz. Really hard to make myself take some home rather than scarf it all, right then. Only complaint - slivered garlic was pickled? Hmm.If I lived anywhere near here, I'd eat here often enough to add some points to my cholesterol count, fo' sho'. As it is, we'll keep it for a special northside treat.

Review Text :
My favorite part of Vegas is the trip home. It has slowly become a tradition to eat here on the way out of Las Vegas. Although our whole group of girls loves this place, I am probably the only one who looks forward to leaving more than anything else for two very delicous words: crab legs.The one thing I have spent my buffet eating trips loving is shrimp and cocktail sauce. Especially when there horseradish standing by. Now although I am still quite enamored with them, I think I have found my buffet soulmate in crab legs. Simply amazing. I am lucky enough to have a Tina Z. in my life who used to work at Red Lobster and has taught me the kung fu art that is extracting crab meat from the shells, but you'll figure it out. Trust me. Hot or cold. With or without fatty butter. I am starving just thinking about them and a little sad that I don't have my next trip out there planned yet. Anyway, for those who don't obsess like me, the rest of the buffet is also excellent. Waffles with strawberry topping or funky french toast covered in crunchy oat things. Pizza with a side of full roasted garlic heads (you read that right, not cloves, heads). Oh and my other weird obsession, bagles with smoked salmon and cream cheese. So good. The dessert bar is also pretty amazing. I fell deeply in love with their coffee flavored flan of some sort. And many flavors of ice cream! Blueberry pie! Man it's a good thing they're located in a different state beacuse I don't have the time to go to as many TKB classes as it would take to burn off these calories.Oooh and the mimosa bar. Not sure if it's an everyday thing, but on Sunday there's a mimosa bar in which you can have champagne and pureed orange, mango, white peach, and a couple of other flavors. By Sunday alcohol is not usually on my list of what I want to drink, but I have started to try a glass here or there.Whenever you can find the time to fit this place into your Vegas trip, make it happen. Oh and you'll only spend ~$20 for a Sunday burnch. So worth it.Oh Boy...I'm taking such a leap by writing a public review on the Silverton Brunch. You know you are my peeps when I let you in on the Silverton. So here we go...here are the reasons why the Seasons Buffet is awesome on a Sunday:1. Hardly a line....everyone is at the strip which is so not the place to be, and look at me and my girls....3 people ahead of us...we are so close to crabs it's not even funny and I'm not just saying that because we are leaving Vegas.2. Large round tables! Yes! I hate having to sit at square tables where you can't hear what is going on at the end and you have to go on a scavenger hunt to find the ketchup. These tables are huge and me and my girls can get to business which involves sharing photos, memories and mimosas.3. CRAB! What the hell happened on the strip? I went to the buffet at the Bellagio for Sunday brunch and there was no crab! Are you joking? Whatev...we are at the Silverton, so pile it on. 4. No rush! The friendly servers at the Silverton want you to sit down and stay awhile. No one pushing you out or frowning when you take obnoxious group photos.5. When you are done eating you are steps away from the BASS PRO SHOP! Hello? Are we out of mace? It is a long trip home....we may need to check out the tents in case we get stuck somewhere....wait...are those stuffed wildlife? Who doesn't love stuffed wildlife? And the Gun selection! Wow! Well, you can definitely spend hours in the Bass Pro Shop that's for sure. Last time we left I ended up with a bottle of water, a pack of red vines and a giant stuffed Jackalope that we fondly named "J-Lope" and yes, she was so big she needed a seat belt. LOVE IT!I've been to Seasons several times and it's OK.  They generally have something that grabs my attention and there's something that wants me to take away a star.  When we ate here Sunday, that stayed as usual.  The grilled vegetables were very good.  I always like their roasted garlic pieces, but this night, the roast beef was cooked until the cow could walk no more.  It was deep, deep brown.  Overcooked completely!The spicy tofu in the Asian section was very good and the deserts rounded out the evening on the plus side.  I had some peach ice cream and a piece of carrot cake.  A nice way to end a meal.The service was very good.  There weren't very many people in the restaurant Sunday night so the servers were stretched to the limit.  I'll come back here and I'll find something quite good again and something that I avoid or isn't quite as good.  The place has lost some of the luster it had when it first opened.So let me start off with a basic fact about me...I am NOT a buffet person!  I will NEVER, EVER  suggest we go to a buffet.  I only go when I am outnumbered or when family is visiting. So take this review as you may.  I went here for the first time this week since I had family staying at the Silverton.  I have eaten at many of the restaurants there and have always been happy, so I was aware of the food quality level and just went with it.  It started off with us in a short line to pay and be seated.  Even though it was a really short line, it took over 25 minutes to get a table.  I'm not sure why, because there were a lot of open tables that I could see and they seemed to be adequately staffed, so I am not sure where the disconnect was.  So that just put me in a bad mood because I was pretty hungry.  Just a warning for y'all, when I get hungry, throw a cracker or something at me because I turn into that girl from the Exorcist when I am starving.  YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.Next up, the food.  I was actually surprised how many sections they had available.  There was a soup and salad bar, pasta bar, pizza, American comfort food, Chinese, Mexican, roasted/grilled meats, and a dessert bar that included freshly made ice cream.  It wasn't a huge buffet, but i found plenty of items that looked and tasted pretty good.  No, it wasn't as big as the World Buffet at the Rio or fancy like the Wynn, but it was ok for what it was.  So yay for that surprise!The service across the board was hit or miss.  Our table server was very nice and on her game.  She did great.  The hostesses were all a bit grumpy.  Some of the chefs behind the food counters were not happy to be there, but the chef at the meat craving station was just adorable.  The chef in the dessert section was happy.  So it was a little all over the place.So Seasons is an average buffet for Vegas quality.  If you are a buffet person and in the area, it is an ok place.Well I've been here several times now for the Polynesian night  and I have to say that the food is good for the price. That being said, I only go when I have the two free buffets  promotion (with the Silverton Rewards Club  Card) and with only two people... so yeah, it's really worth it. A lot of items are hit or miss but overall I can't complain and it has actually gotten better each time I go. There usually  isn't much of a wait and the food is always hot and generally fresh.  If you haven't tried it in a while, wait for the promotion and try it again after all free food is better than.. well okay.. it's free food, deal with it.  For the rest of the review, keep in mind that we brought two teens with us that took our price from free to just over $40 before tip. Also, this review is ONLY for the Polynesian night.Now, for what's good. Their tuna poke seems to occupy a considerable portion of my plate each time. The giant roasted pig freaked the kids out but whatever, they think McDonalds rules the world so they don't count. The roasted pig is very good every time I have it. There was also some salt and pepper pork that seriously made an impression on everyone at the table including the grumpy, texting teens. There were a couple of soups that were really good especially the one over by the sushi that had the clear noodles. I don't remember the name but it looked so nasty that I just had to try it and to my surprise it was actually very good. The Wonton soup was very good as well. The mashed potatoes and bowtie pasta were great. I even had a couple pieces of a spicy tuna roll that didn't offend me as sushi on a buffet can often do.  Also, the peel  and eat shrimp was good but naturally should have been fail proof one would think.  The oysters are usually decent enough except for the fact that they ran out of them by 4:45pm. We arrived at 4:30pm and they open at 4pm and I didn't even get one. Not cool. I stood there and watched as the guy in front of me filled up two plates until there were none left. I was impressed with his lack of consideration for the line of  people behind him and yet jealous at the same time.  The empty space was replaced with clams that had something on them that I wasn't all that impressed with.  The clams were fresh but the topping just ruined it for me, not my thing I guess. Some misses were believe it or not the macaroni and cheese. Bad enough to spit out. Same  goes for the macaroni  salad and popcorn shrimp. Just bad. Like take it off the buffet entirely kinda bad. No really. Now for the prime rib. Usually it is pretty good. This last time was different. It was cooked entirely rare and if anyone wanted it cooked differently it was sliced and put on a grill to be cooked to their liking. As I watched cooked slices being handed off to other customers it looked like nothing more than a bad steak. I opted for mine rare as I generally like it. Unfortunately I couldn't even eat that. I felt really bad having to leave an excellent  cut of meat on my plate. It just felt wrong.Overall, the food (on Polynesian night)was good enough to go back, when it's free (or BOGO), if you don't bring teens, just happen to be in the area and are in general just really hungry enough to not care.You just need to find what you like and stick with that. Unfortunately this isn't the type of buffet where you walk in and love every single item that they have. I give it three stars only because I know that what is good is really good and that comprises more than half of the buffet. As for the rest of the buffet,  it may be a bit blah but a person can only eat so much anyway. I just go back to the good stuff and that works for me. If I had to pay the regular price of $21.99 I probably wouldn't go. That being said, I have no doubt that I will be returning when my next promotion comes in the mail.I came to Seasons buffet at the Silverton Hotel to meet up one of my BFF's and her fiancé for dinner. We stood in line and got a table for 5. They soon came after. I was impressed at how nice this buffet was. Food was actually good. As I mentioned before, I'm not a buffet type of person but I liked what they served. I saw that they had the traditional Hawaiian food such as lau lau, chicken long rice, and pork. Mostly known as lechon to the Filipino community. Yum! The lechon was good and tender. Skin was crunchy. I also had fried rice, cream cheese wontons, and the noodles. Finally a place with noodles which I was craving earlier. The waiter was good about refilling our drinks. The cream cheese wontons were huge and had a good sized amount of cheese. I wish I could have taken more pictures but I got caught up in the food and conversation with my BFF and her fiancé. For dessert, I got the sugar free desserts. Trying to watch my sugars. I got a small sugar free cheesecake and a small sugar free fruit tart. So good. Cheesecake tasted smooth and fresh. They also had the regular desserts such as fudge, red velvet cake and so much more. Wish I could have had more but I was already full. The buffet was pretty pricey. It was $19.99 with the Silverton card and $21.99 without the card. Kids under 4 eat free! That's even great for my daughter. This was definitely worth trying. Highly recommend!

Restaurant name  Christopher's and Crush Lounge
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
I rarely give 5 stars, as I believe it is very difficult to obtain a perfect score through food, beverage, service, ambiance, etc. Christopher's new venture is perfectly Christopher, 5 stars.First off a little background, Christopher is a native. That's right; he's a graduate of Central High School. He studied in France where he honed his craft and to this day draws his technique from. He has owned now three ventures in Phoenix, first his fine dining and bistro location on the northwest corner of 24st and Camelback (later became Eddie's by Eddie Matney, former hair dresser turned chef at Cous-Cous then Eddie's Grill) then after closing he moved to the restaurant row in The Biltmore Fashion Park, 2rd level to open Christopher's Fermier Brasserie & Paola's Wine Bar. Which in reading many reviews here on Yelp was unfortunately misunderstood. It makes me wonder if people understand what French is, it's not their fault though, there aren't many French restaurants in town, most have be closed, including Mary Elaine's at the Phoenician  and John Claude's Petite Cafe. There are a few that still survive Sophie's and Vincent's, but in this town of chains few people venture for French. Now with Christopher's Restaurant/Crush Lounge he has passed on the wine bar and opened a lounge instead. Christopher does enjoy lounges as he is a regular at Merc Bar, but then so is his smoked salmon which is offered on the Merc Bar menu. So a lounge makes sense, I'm a believer in a chef should open what they are passionate about. The new location has a different feel from his previous; his last venture echoed a French Countryside feel, as did the food. I think that was why many didn't understand it; yes it was French, but ALL FRENCH IS NOT FINE DINNING. I wish more understood that concept, but this is primarily a beer drinking state, not wine or rather more Mc D's not Mary E's! Hence there's a difference between filling your stomach and filling your soul and leaving a restaurant inspired with the feeling that life is wonderful. Christopher's is the latter. The design is contemporary with long lines of brushed stainless, white linen and exposed wooden beams. Kudos to whoever designed it, great job! The tables are dressed with white linen, elegant silver and polished stemware. You can't help but feel that it's 'time to dine' when seated. The walls in the main dining room have many vases of fresh flowers that seem to be replaced whenever necessary, nice touch.  The food at Christopher's is exactly what you'd expect, French, without the super-high-end prices. He's still one of the only chefs in town serving Foie Grass and Duck Confite, both wonderful and worth the trip if a glass of juice (wine) is added! I've been there now on 4 occasions and everything is fantastic, flavorful and prepared professionally. Christopher offers daily specials and I recommend them including; Veal Chop on Wednesdays, Roasted Duck on Thursday, Lamb Shank on Friday and Rabbit on Saturday. But don't stop at your entree, get the cheese course for dessert or for something sweet, the Chocolate Tower is one of the best desserts in town, hands down, no question.  Service is another point were Christopher sets himself apart. It doesn't get any better than this. Again it's NOT fine dining, so you can't compare it to fine dining restaurants (but then again there's only one left in the valley - Different Point Of View).  The servers know the food; they can describe anything on the menu and recite the specials as if their job depends on it (if you know Christopher it probably is).  Food is coursed correctly with a few minutes in between, as well as wine service is as professional as it gets. The bread service is as always, French breads with a super rich, euro butter, perfect for lapping up to sauce or vinaigrette remains on your plate.Needless to say, Christopher does it right, in my opinion, or is it just my opinion? Many of the valley's most celebrated chefs eat at Christopher's, he's know in many circles as the "chef's chef". But don't take my word for it, ask the chef at your favorite restaurant, who their favorite chefs are in town, and favorite restaurants, most likely Christopher will make the list!Here's the web address:  http://www.christophersaz.com/The website is limited; menu, wine list, press release and pictures of the restaurant...My new favorite happy hour spot! 1/2 priced wine (with excellent options to choose from) and select appetizers from 3-6 p.m. The cheese plate could well be one of the best in the Valley. Four chef selections with crostini and only about $8 at happy hour. The mac and cheese is heavenly, creamy, goodness (and, at only $7, a complete steal!). Service was outstanding. I love sitting at the kitchen bar and watching the attention to detail and rhythm and beauty of the preparations. On my most recent visit, chef de cuisine John Green was in the kitchen. He has a charming personality and seems to enjoy engaging with his public. He had overheard us oohing and ahhing over the gruyere mashed potatoes and generously sneaked us each a spoonful to sample. They were delicious - you could taste booth the butter AND the cheese. He patiently and playfully answered our questions and, on occasion, even challenged us to guess. It was so fun! I can't imagine wanting to sit away from this kitchen!On my list to try: the parmesan encrusted goat cheese and bacon salad, the burgers, lobster bisque and the beautiful steaks!! Quick! Someone, save me a seat!!If this is how the French eat, I have no problem with booking a one way flight there and eating my way through the country. Sorry Rob. Been a great 8 years, promise to write, kthxbai! Christopher's Restaurant has elevated our expectations of fine dining to a level that is dangerously high. We started with cocktails and first courses: the sweetbread and an order of escargot. It was our first time eating either, and I'm definitely a fan of both. I also noticed we seemed to be the only ones eating our bread, and whether that's more we were just eating our way through whatever they brought out or other patrons were carb conscious, I'll never know. For our entrees, Robert order the fillet mignon and I ordered the duck; we ordered a side of gnocchi. Sweet baby Jesus! Were these the most flavorful, succulent and outrageously orgasmic cuts of meat God ever saw fit to be served? I'm thinking so, because chewing was simply a customary task and an excuse to keep the meat in contact with our taste buds that much longer. And the gnocchi, mary, was splendid and deserving of a Nobel Peace Prize. The sheer richness of each course was overwhelming. So much so, that I couldn't finish my duck. But unlike that over-filled feeling one gets when getting stuffed, this was a pleasant sensation of being fulfilled. I can't wait to go back, this time on a Thursday because I want to try their rabbit and see how good it is. In the meantime, I'm going to be studying French and dining etiquette so I at least appear to be refined.Don't tell anyone Christopher. But I have a serious crush on you and your elegant eatery and your fabulous Crush Lounge. This could rival my Scott Baio crush in the 70s. Or my crush on arrugula, beet and goat cheese salad in the 80s. Or even my 90s crush, yep, again, Scott Baio. We were greeted by a lovely host person who gave us the 411 on our dining options. We chose the restaurant kitchen bar which had happy hour prices on food and drink. No sooner had Rickie and I bucked up to the bar did we have our server take our drink order: two iced teas and a large flat water. Soon to follow was some delicious pillowy yet crunchy French bread with a ramekin of soft buttah!While we waited for our food it was most entertaining watching the kitchen staff prepare for what was sure to be a very busy Valentine's weekend. And since I was already with my Valentine, I was most happy. We had a delicious cheese plate with herbed chevre, Manchego, Pecorino Romano and a mild cheese I won't even try to spell. I had a crispy, creamy pizza with goat cheese, roasted garlic and oven dried tomatoes. Very good though I kept thinking of my favorite flat bread delight at St. Francis. Hmmm...Rickie had a burger he enjoyed though the top bun was very doughy and not pleasant to eat. Yam fries were tasty though a dipping sauce would have been fun. All that was only $36!Now. Is it just me but does every new restaurant try to out do the next guy with the jazziest bathroom sinks? Well, I'd have to say, Christopher's takes home the gold. A huge communal sink with a wall in front of you that shoots out water below as you rub your hands over hundreds of little rocks. Enjoyable! And now in the 2000s I have a new crush. And it's a sink. Sorry Scott. OMG...I think I just finished my 400th review! Cheers my yelpitas!I'll post a review of my one happy hour experience there. I intend to go back for more. Again and again.The happy hour runs from 3 to 6, and it was suggested--no--urgently pleaded to me by other regulars that I go just for one dish available half-price during that time: The cheeseburger. It's honest-to-god prime rib ground on premises, served on a ciabatta roll with a selection of yam and potato fries. And yes, it is delicious. It was so delicious  that I want to go back to try the rest of the happy hour menu. It was so fully worth the $7 that I think I would have felt satisfied paying the full $14. I want to work my way through the menu and report back each time.When you enter the hostess politely asks if you came only for drinks (most of which are half-price during HH) or food as well. If it's only drinks you get to sit in the hip-a-riffic wine bar to your left, where stylish Helmut-Newton-looking pictures of fabulous babes with wine wait to stimulate you. If you are going to avail yourself of the food menu you are directed to the Cadillac of lunch counters, where all places are set with fine linen and silverware. You get to watch chefs prepare your meal in front of you. Sound exotic? It's more like Kresge's circa 1974, but the experience of eating brilliant impeccable food from a five-and-dime lunch counter is thrilling in a way.The downside--if there is one--is that there is basically none of the "vibe" that you'd get in a more sporty place. This is a nice, quiet, high-toned place, So maybe "happy hour" is a misnomer. Maybe it's more of a "Maslovian Elevation Hour", where one can sit and reflect that if one has time and means to enjoy a perfectly lovely prime-rib cheeseburger for $7, life isn't so bad after all.So yes, thumbs up.Ok here is the short and not so sweet.This place is not good, over priced, and located in the back of the biltmore for a good reason. Just think reasonably good restaurants ie, zin burger, tru foods, capital grill are all visible in the front of the biltimore. Ok enough said on location.We came after happy hour, apparently the time where this place is semi decent because food and drinks are half off.We ordered drinks that were overpriced and short pours. It is a wannabe higher end wine lounge. ok on to the overpriced and over salted food.Beet salad was decent. Wild mushroom pizza was more salt than pizza. Burger was burnt and truffle fries were ok.The kicker of the evening were when 2 women showed up and decided to sit next to us, when the whole lounge was empty. Anyways, they were loud and winey and complaining how they had been recently dumped (I wonder why?) Then Christopher Gross came outside. My husband and I thought he was making the rounds, which would have been nice, but that was not the case. He sat his right next to the obnoxious girls and fed into their bitching. He even supplied them with champagne.Well I guess if my restaurant was completely empty I would hit on pathetic patrons too. So you guessed it, I will not be returning.The food was decent, however I am writing about their underhanded business practices.I ordered a travelzoo voucher for $69 that included 2 3 course meals. It said "Regularly $140". What we ordered, if had been ordered off the regular menu would have been about $100. However, we were charged tax on the full $140. Second, even though on the voucher it says "PLEASE TIP ON THE FULL VALUE OF THE CHECK." (which implies tip is not included and we get to choose the tip amount) and nowhere mentions automatic gratuity, 18% gratuity (18% of $140, even though we ordered $100 worth of food at the most) was automatically added to our check.Third, even if you had ordered the most expensive options, the highest possible amount it could be worth is $120, not $140. It is mathematically impossible to have the voucher be a $140 value, but that is what they add tax and tip to.Fourth, after we told our waiter we were using a voucher, he seemed less interested in the service level of our table, which i later realized was because he had a guaranteed 18% (of $140) tip.I just noticed today they have another travelzoo deal "$79 - AWARD-WINNING FRENCH DINNER FOR 2 W/WINE, REG. $165", I am posting this so hopefully if anyone is thinking of buying that voucher, they will read this first before they purchase it.A friend was in town recently and wanted a great meal.  Although I had not been there, I suggested Christopher's.  When we arrived we decided to eat at the kitchen bar, but after we ordered out drinks we saw a couple seated outside and decided it was a perfect night for it.  We asked the hostess if we could move and she begrudging agreed.  When we walked outside, she wanted to seat us at the table right next to the door (I think as punishment for this huge imposition) even though there were plenty of other tables available.  We asked to sit at the table farthest from the door to give us some space between the other diner and be in a better position to watch the world go by.  The hostess found this very upsetting and tried to force us to sit next to the door, but after our protestations finally said it would be OK with her if we sat at the other table, but that the server was not going to like it.  She sat us in purgatory as steam escaped from her ears and brought our drinks, but that was the last we saw of any servers.  I did notice the hostess and some servers were having quite a discussion about us and I heard one person say "OK, fine, we will let them finish their drinks".  I wasn't exactly sure what that meant, but after 15-20 minutes of being left in the cold and while we were finishing our drinks, the bread guy came by and we asked him to ask someone to get our check.  A waiter finally showed up with a check and was bewildered to find out we were leaving.  However, my impression was that they had decided not to serve us dinner and were simply waiting for us to get the message.That is a very large space Christopher is paying rent on and that night the restaurant was almost empty.  I would think in the current economic environment his staff would have the good sense to bend over backwards to accommodate their guests, but we were left with the impression that they felt they were doing us a favor by being open.I went to Christopher's for Happy Hour on a Thursday night.  We sat at the counter area by the open kitchen.  The advantage sitting by the kitchen is that you get to sample food from the Chef.  Can't beat that!  They have a good selection of pizzas, flatbreads, wines on their HH menu.  I had the Wild Mushrooms Shallots & Arugula, which normally is $16 but its $8.  You get a full pizza loaded with arugula and mushrooms.  Pizza was on a thin crust and crunchy. The sweet potato fries needed dipping sauce.  It was good, but tasted that it has been sitting in the heat lamp.   The service is sincere and friendly, but can be slow at times.  Christopher's is a very charming place for those looking for an eclectic experience.Came here with the Better Half to celebrate her Birthday.  The restaurant came highly recommended by a friend, and we noticed that they had Foie Gras on the menu (her fave) so we decided to check it out.  We reviewed the menu before we got to the restaurant and decided to order:Roasted Foie Gras Prepared Sous Vide - $110 Smoked Truffle-Infused Filet Mignon - $38For sides - $8 each:Mac n' Cheese au Gratin w/ HamGnocchiPotatoes Au GratinThe server took the order and came back a few minutes later to tell us that they're out of Foie Gras.  We were extremely disappointed and surprised....especially since there were 3 items on the menu that had Foie Gras as the main ingredient and the place wasn't packed.  In an attempt to save the day, the server checked with the kitchen and came back and said there was a small piece of Foie Gras left for the Appetizer but that he could prepare it like the entree.  Since we came all the way down here for the dish, we agreed.While we were waiting for our dinner, our Bread and Water was never refilled and we had to pour our own Wine.  For a restaurant like this, we didn't expect that kind of service.The food arrived...the Filet was decent, but not great.  Not as tender as I usually like it.  The highlight was the Gnocchi.  The Better Half said her Foie Gras tasted a little funny.  She didn't finish her serving.Overall, the experience was sub-par.  The server's attempt to save the day kept us from giving this place 1 Star.Return Factor - 5%Still my favorite happy hour spot. Half priced wines -- a HUGE selection of quality wines from which to choose -- and gourmet quality food. While not on the happy hour menu specifically, the mac n cheese remains a deal. It's cheesy but not gooey. The spiral noodles are perfectly cooked. You'll find plenty of pieces of thinly sliced ham. The flat breads and burgers are standbys. And, these are among the only sweet potato fries I will eat -- generally, I hate sweet potatoes but the seasoning and texture of these fries is doable. ;)Save me a seat at the bar!Cristopher's Restaurant (former  Crush Lounge) is a really high quality and fun place to eat.  I was in town for a conference and several of my colleagues recommended this restaurant.  Glad I went.First, I have to start off this review by saying that the service here is OUTSTANDING.  Or, maybe just our waiter (John or was it David?) was the bombshadiggidy.  He immediately greeted everyone and learned our names (and used it throughout the night).  Super professional and funny service.  Awesome!For appetizers, I had the Foie Gras pate.  It was served with bread and pickled vegetables.  Very traditional French, and very fun to eat!   Grade:  BFor my main meal, I ordered the Foie Gras Prepared Sous Vide.  This dish was well worth the hefty price tag.  It was delicious and well prepared.  Seared foie gras served in it's glory, accompanied by roasted brussel sprouts white and purple cauliflower, and plated with a delicious sauce.  Beautiful presentation.  Quality cuts of foie gras.  Grade:  A-http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/christophers-restaurant-crush-lounge-phoenix?userid=jI5grCzPrcpYgqtNVygWRQ#RpUC0AEb0MeZNoJUwNPutgI'm a fan!Food Grade:  A-Service Grade:  A+Worth the Money Grade:  B+Overall Impression:  A-Another addition to "Pissed at myself for not trying sooner". I think I had't been to Christopher's sooner because of it's location. I'm usually at the Biltmore shopping and spending too much money at the Apple Store. So I usually walk on by to head home play with my new toy(s).So I finally made a conscious effort to go and I was pretty sure upon walking in that I would regret not coming sooner. I had a few drinks at Crush lounge and though tiny, it fit the bill for an actual lounge. So many places call themselves lounges when they're just a bar trying to glorify themselves.Crush is a true lounge-a small scale version of what you might find at a boutique hotel:intimate, dimly lit, good music and private spaces to enjoy a cocktail with someone special. I have to make it an effort to come here for cocktails more often because the vibe here is usually what I'm looking for-mental note made.After drinks we took a seat at the Kitchen Bar, where it was awesome to watch Christopher and his team at working creating culinary works of art. I went on a Monday where I was able to take advantage of one of their specials: grilled tenderloin with au gratin potatoes for $20. SCORE!!!!! It was served sliced up and served with a Cabernet reduction which was delicious. I also got to try some mushroom and arugula pizza which was served on such heavenly crust. Everything was c'est magnifique!I really have to applaud them as well for a top notch wine list. I LOVE South African wine and there are very few places in the U.S. that  feature on their wine list. So as if I wasn't happy enough with my meal and the experience this little extra plus is what earned them five stars in my book.This is a very nice place and I can't wait to bring my family here. I'm sure a lot of folks may overlook this place if they're busy shopping. If nothing else, stop in for lunch and see why you need ot make it back for dinner.We did the worst thing you can ever do to a waiter.  Ever.We showed up 30 minutes before happy hour and some of our group, who shall remain nameless, wanted to wait until happy hour started before anything was ordered.  At first the waiter was visibly upset by this but he soon warmed up to us and never for a moment gave us anything by amazing service.  Perhaps because it was his birthday he was in such a good mood he decided to cut us some underserved slack.I enjoyed a bottle of wine with friends which is something I don't usually enjoy.  I shared some olives and a pizza as well. The pizza was amazing but honestly the olives stole the show.  They are warm and for $5 you get so many it's easily a meal.  I will almost almost assuredly go back for, if nothing else, those olives.

Review Text :
By all means this is the most authentic Irish pub in Montreal. This feeling is even stronger if you end up in the pub in the early afternoon when the music is very low volume and people quietly mind their business over a pint. Two floors with several bars, different sets of tables and some cosy sections, certainly a pub you can find your preferred place to sit and enjoy your Guiness. The black creamy liquid is not a single choice in the pub, endless list of beers on tap, nice variety of whiskeys makes it perfect place to meet friends and enjoy your time together. There is a life music every night, the best is when you end up listening to some of the resident bands who have warmed up so many Christmas parties with some of my best buddies at work. Well Hurley's certainly brings memories if you have been visiting long enough.The five stars for the pub are because of our bar tender yesterday, she did a wonderful demo how to poor slowly Guinness and took care of the fire when for the first time in so many years I finally made it to the most wanted spot in this pub during the winter, the magic fire place.4.5I've never been to Ireland but stories, pictures and reviews have led me to believe that what I experienced at Hurley's is as close to the real things as I can get in North America. Raucous. Bawdy. Loud. Festive. Hurley's is all these things and more. We didn't arrive until late and left after last call. Our waitress was in no rush to kick us out. Her brogue was so lovely to hear. Behind my booth, a quartet of loud, ornery fellows drank like fish, cursed like sailors and collapsed on to each other in a fit of hysterical storytelling that comes with age, years of friendship... and lots of booze.I loved it.I know people come here for food but it wasn't that kind of party. I started with a pint of Kilkenny, transitioned to a Snakebite and ended the evening with a beer cocktail I'd never had before: stout (Guinness) + chambord. I think it's called a Black Fog. A bit sweet and girly but at that time of night after the night I'd had... who cares. I was carousing, telling tales, yelling, and being drunkbelligerent. It was awesome.Imbibing so much beer caused me to wander around looking for a bathroom. As I did so, I had the chance to check out the pub. It had the wood & stone that would fit easily in to a city of age and history. Around every nook and cranny (or, you know, corner) there was another story to discover. I was particularly interested by the outside space, upstairs bar (and closed off areas), brick archways, and brilliant woodwork found in/at the bar/booth area. I'm, typically, not a fan of Americanized Irish pubs because they feel inauthentic and as though they're trying way too hard. This isn't the case at all at Hurley's. From my novice opinion, this is the real deal and it's easy to see why it's such a beloved Montreal institution. I'd gladly come back. I would just come earlier in the evening, eat some food and prepare to stay there all night, getting loud, drinking beer, challenging strangers, and telling stories. Sláinte!

Whenever I am running around in the Deer Valley area, I try to stop in to this location. They seem to be a little less crowded (for the most part) than their other locations and I've never had an issue with slow table bus-sing, etc.The most appealing part of this chain is that their food is consistent and reasonably priced. Personal favorites for breakfast are either of the Fritatta's (Honey-Cured Ham and Brie or Feta and Roasted Vegetable) if I'm feeling the need for something substantial. If I'm feeling a little sinful, I go straight for the Lemon Ricotta Pancakes, sans syrup and slathered in fresh whipped butter and blueberry compote (ask nicely and they'll pony up extra blueberries). Blue teeth be damned, I simply can't get enough of these things - they are light and melt in your mouth with the most amazing flavor. I used to always buy a package of the mix on the way out, so that I could indulge in privacy, but I've only seen the basic mix as of late. : (For lunch or dinner I'm a sucker for the Roast Beef and Gorgonzola Sandwich (perfectly rare Roast Beast topped with fresh greens, roasted red peppers, and just the right amount of cheese) or the Wildflower Two, which allows you to select any two from their daily soups, half sandwich, or salads.If you don't have time for a meal, stop in and grab a loaf of yummy bread. My personal favorites are the Nine Grain and the Honey Wheat-berry. Or have some real fun and buy one of their mother truck-in HUGE soft pretzels. These things are so big, you could hook each side loop on to your ears and wear them as a mask... hey maybe I'm seeing a new super hero being born... pretzel man!Any way you slice it, you should be able to find something to tempt your palette, so grab your table card, fill up your drink, enjoy whatever local artist they have performing, and delight in the world of carbs!Wildflower you fickled little minx.  Well you certainly have made some great little dishes lately and not  too  shabby on service.  Thanks for the delish salad, cute little potato soup in a bread bowl and your meatball sandwiches look back to the old days.. Well looks like you are back in the family rotation  welcome back we have missed you.When this place first opened, I was working for a company nearby and would frequent this establishment often because it reminded me of Northern CA. It had good bread, interesting combinations and at the time, a non-chain quality ingredient type restaurant. I introduced many to this place including my Mother and co-workers galore. When I was in AZ in January, I had a breakfast date planned with a girlfriend from high school. It is amazing at what connections Facebook has brought back into my life and this is one of the great ones. I suggested to meet here because it was easy enough to hop on the 101 from Sun City and easy enough for her to hop on I-17 from where she lives. I arrived a little early and waited in the car right in front of the restaurant. I  was thrilled to see how busy it was and all the people drinking coffee and eating outside with their dogs. As I was getting out of the car, I noticed a particular stunning dog and talked to him first then looked at the owner of the pooch. Wouldn't you know it, but it was on of my old bosses (a big boss at that) whom I hadn't seen in maybe 12 years. Small world indeed!Lara walked up and we went inside. I had to keep myself from drooling at all of the baked offerings and almost ordered my old favorite lunch instead of breakfast. After going back and forth a little (this is an order at the counter type of place) I opted for the lemon ricotta pancakes and a couple of over easy eggs on the side. Lara ordered the banana nut pancakes with scrambled eggs and we both had iced tea. The bill was something less than $20 and we easily found a booth, hankered down and sipped on delicious tea while we waited for our food.The food was great-eggs perfectly done, pancakes delicious albeit a little more dense than I am used to with ricotta cakes, but really good. We took up the booth for what seemed like hours (it was really only about 1 1/2) and chatted away. Was the breakfast 5 stars, no, probably more like a solid 3.75 but for all they offer, for the memories, the company and the iced tea alone, it is a 5 all the way.The Wildflower seed was planted before I even visited this place.  My wife brought on of their Morning Glory muffins home for me.  Yum.  That got me in the door.  Had to have another Morning Glory muffin.  So when I tried them I also had a small breakfast of eggs and ham which was pretty tasty and reasonable.  And of course I left with another Morning Glory muffin.  I only ate half at a time though.  I'm sure a Morning Glory whole would be pretty fulfilling.Wildflower is growing on me...Adding another free wifi place to my list doesn't hurt either.I am so so sad that they took away my very favorite sandwich....The Cheddar Braised Beef. It was the best sandwich there. Savory Beef, Mashed Potatoes, cheese, and Au Jus dip. Now its gone :(The Wildflower Bread Company has a pretty dominant presence in Arizona with all of the various locations. The closest location to me is the one in Tempe.I love the Tempe location. I especially love the connection to Changing Hands book store. It's so fun to check out the books and then to sit with a yummy bread bowl of potato soup and admire your new book purchases.The menu is pretty great! They serve breakfast until:10:30am week days/2pm on weekendsBreakfast:FrittatasBreakfast SandwichesOatmealFruitsBagelsSignature Pancakes(my favorite are the lemon ricotta)(see pics)Lunch/Dinner:Soups served in the sourdough bread "boule"(my favorite is the potato soup)Specialty SandwichesSaladsPastasMost every item is under $10.

Very good taiwanese food and the lady is always very friendly. I love their beef noodles soup. The service might be slow compared to other restaurant but they made almost every dish upon order. Don't go there if you are in rush. I also loved their home cookies. The price is more than reasonable.

I admit their food is great, and it's a cool place to hang out. However, maybe this is due to some of the recent fame and attention that they've received but their attitude towards customers have changed! My friend and I went in, hoping to enjoy their yummy food, but once we stepped in, no one greeted us. And about 2-3 minutes of awkwardly standing around in this tiny restaurant, a man came to us and said: "You're probably not going to be able to eat here, but for how many?" we replied "For two please" then we got the rudest reply I've ever heard, "Ehhh- Not gonna happen! Sorry"In a very demeaning tone. Anyways, I really do hope their service improves. There is nothing cool about being pretentious to customers.

Restaurant name  Tossed

Review Text :
Yay - I see I'm the first to review the first Arizona franchise of "the leader of the salad revolution." I'd heard of Tossed before (maybe because it was voted "NYC's best salad" by New York Magazine.) Or, maybe because my friend opened a similar concept called Dressed in Atlanta... either way, I'm the kind of girl that loves a big salad for lunch, and I'm psyched to have a place like tossed here in Arizona...As of today, October 10, Tossed has been open just over a week. So I know I can't be too tough on them... when we went a few days ago, they were still getting used to being open. Even so, it was a positive experience.  The space itself is pretty large for a salad restaurant.  I think it used to be an Arizona Bread Company - I hope it does well at this location as I'd love for it to stay!I was with my brother; I asked if he'd join me for lunch at tossed since I really wanted to try it.  We walked in and figured out to go to the side that was to order in (as the other side was for catering and take out orders) - it was kind of confusing, but we later learned (from Gazwan Paulus, the Area Developer) that bigger signs are on their way.Since I'd picked up one of the tossed menus before we went, we both were somewhat familiar with it, but it still took me a few minutes at the register to design my own salad from their huge list of ingredients.  Zack chose from the list of "specialty salads and creative interpretations of familiar favorites" and ordered the Southwest Blackened Chicken Salad.  I finally chose my unique combo of greens, chick peas, chopped tomato, avocado, turkey, and maybe celery.  I also suggested to Zack that we order one of their whole wheat crepes (that are made fresh in the store to create crepe wrap sandwiches) to share.  After we ordered and payed, we were given a # to bring to the table - I do like the fast casual concept.  However, it was not until after we ordered that we were able to actually see all of the ingredients in front of us - I may have chose differently after seeing everything laid out in front of me...Regardless, it was only a matter of minutes before  our beautiful salads were delivered to us.  Presentation was beautiful, service was friendly, and best of all, our salads were delicious!  I'd taken the suggestion from Tori (the girl who took our order) to taste the Strawberry Balsamic Vinaigrette as my dressing and it was delicious - Thanks again, Tori!  We were both pleased with what we ordered; the crepes were a light, chewy, unique texture that we both really enjoyed as well.  Somehow a bite or two of cheese made it into my salad which isn't the end of the world, but I knew I hadn't ordered it- I'll let it go since they are still so new.There are a ton of other salads that I look forward to designing at tossed and I cannot wait to go back for more!  You may want to check it out online before you go as the menu can be a bit overwhelming.  Prices range from $6.95 - $10.95 but can get even more expensive if you like to add a ton of ingredients.  I'd plan on spending about $10 per person on average.  Not so bad... oh, and they also soup, smoothies, and sweet treats including freshly baked cookies, brownies, and fruit - there is something for everyone.As we were leaving, we met the Area Developer I spoke of above and he was really nice... he wanted to make sure we had a good experience and he told us of their plans to build locations of tossed all around the Valley.  I hope they will consider coming to Old Town because that's where I'll be soon!

Review Text :
So let me just say upfront that this place redefines kitch! I mean I would be shocked if you could find one square inch on a counter or wall that is not filled with some cutesy cup or sloppy slang. But I adore this place. It's small and there is almost always a bit of a wait, but the staff hustles and they are incredibly friendly. The menu is surprisingly large and creative for a family run, diner style breakfast and lunch place. They offer the obvious choices you would expect of this fare, but then they toss in a little something to juice it up. They have a standing Steak and Eggs special for $5.95 that I have never sampled but I've seen one hell of a lot of them move through that kitchen! They also have a fairly decent all you can eat Fish deal from 11:00 to close. My personal favorites would have to be either... wait for it... "The Julie Plate" (yes it is actually called that) or the Breakfast Burrito (which bulges with ham, sausage, bacon, cheese, chiles, and country potatoes). But try one of their daily specials, like German Pancakes, and you may be hard pressed to go back to the regular menu. One word of caution is that the servings here are HUGE. I can literally make three meals out of the BB and still have a bite or two to share with my dogs. Ronnie's opens at 6:00 or 6:30 a.m. (don't know which, because I'm not awake at that time of day) and closes at 2:00 p.m. It is not pretentious. It is the kind of place that is comfortable, clean, and serves a steady stream of loyal customers which are greeted by name along with hugs and smiles. Prices are reasonable if you consider the amount of food you receive, and the consistent quality / selection far exceeds that of the most popular chains. If you are looking for trend, go somewhere else... it will just make my table free up a little sooner. ; )Stopped in here Saturday  morning after some friends suggested it and, of course, I had Yelped it.  Julie wasn't sure when they opened (6AM) so I got there about 6:45 and the place was already about 1/3 full.  The waitress, who appeared to be old enough to be my mother, made sure I knew about the senior menu on the back cover.The service was pretty good.  They initially forgot me as I had been seated in the front corner but after that I was checked on on a regular basis.  I am pretty sure all 3 of the waitresses were seniors and they put a lot of younger servers to shame as they bustled around taking care of their and each others customers.  Definite teamwork in play.  Many of the customers appeared to be regulars as they chatted with the waitresses and folks at other tables.I may have ordered the wrong thing.  I had the Sh-- on a shingle with 2 eggs on the side and a large glass of orange juice.  It consisted of their standard white gravy with some shreds of corned beef on top.  The basic gravy had a pepper taste which I have had before in diners but I would have assumed the dish would be made with chipped beef.  Probably not ordered consistently enough to make it worth while.  Even after eating my eggs the gravy was scalding hot and I was surprised it had not separated or filmed over, which would have been my luck doing it at home.  Total bill w/tax $9.51, and I was full.Overall the place had a good vibe to it.  It opens early enough I want to stop in and try some of the breakfast specials that are only available on weekdays.Ronnies is a good place to have a nice breakfast or a decent lunch. The staff is good, they keep your drinks full and will help you in any way possible. We went for lunch. I had a pastrami sandwich and it was good but not great. There was nothing that made it stand out and say "Here I am, I am the best Pastrami you have ever had" While I am glad the food does not talk to me I was hoping for a little more. LOL If I were a huge breakfast fan, I would try this again. Otherwise, it will be in the distant rotation if I am ever stuck and can't find a new place to go.WARNING fellow Yelpers! The 4 star rating is very deceptive. If you have ever read any of my previous reviews you know I don't pull any punches. I tell it just the way it is. They served me a rotten smelly piece of yellowing NY strip steak with my breakfast. Had it removed and replaced with rotten smelly sausage links and patties. The gravy for the biscuits had the same stench as the rotten meat. I think they used the juice from the putrid meat to flavor the gravy. The odor was so bad it was triggering our gag reflexes continuously! Absolutely disgusting and ruined our appetite completely. Hoping to salvage some of the food, I scraped my remaining food onto the toast plate so it would not be contaminated by the smelly steak juice. It didn't help! My son could not finish his breakfast either! They did remove the steak from the bill but charged for the smelly sausage. Total for this garbage was over $20. We were both wondering why there were numerous full plates of food on various tables but no customers were seated there. I think after one whiff they just up and left. Good for them...saved a trip to the ER! The busser would quickly scoop them up as they left. After we gave the busser our unfinished plates of garbage you could still detect the smell of rotten meat. YUCK! No wonder they are dog friendly...They're probably cadaver dogs! Ha haWe prob won't be able to eat a traditional type breakfast for weeks if not months!

Review Text :
Y'know that feeling where you ate so much that you can only breathe through your  mouth?  Well, that happened to me last night as I gorged and gorged on an endless supply of meat at Texas de Brazil.  And boy, was I paying for it afterwards.  I was drunk...on food.  I was delirious from overeating, my eyes were glossy, and I could barely walk straight.  I had eaten myself to oblivion.After our waiter (Adam) gave us the whole introduction of how it worked here, we helped ourselves to the salad bar.  I was pleasantly surprised with their offerings and loaded up on marinated artichoke hearts, cooked mushrooms, quinoa, au gratin potatoes, marinated garlic gloves, shrimp, their soup of the day (lobster bisque), and all their other good stuff.The Big F was taking a bit too long to turn his little card over to green, so I started without him.  Meanwhile, the sides were soon to arrive.* Garlic Mashed Potatoes - I was too busy enjoying the creaminess of the au gratin potatoes to give much attention to the mashed version.* Sweet Fried Bananas - This is probably what put me over the edge.  It was so sweet and sugary good and I ate a lot of it, and I do mean a lot.  The cinnamon on these bananas just had me wanting more and more.  And I probably did take a bite of the banana in between every bite of meat, I just couldn't help it.  It was that good.  And the Big F was having more than his share too!* Brazilian Cheese Bread - It was good, but I had better.  Just as well since I didn't need that for an additional filler.  The Big F finished off the bread basket on his own!They usually offer around 8-15 kinds of meat in one day, among the meats that I tried: * Cordeiro - Young leg of lamb that is tender and full of flavor.  Definitely a good one!* Costela de Carneiro - My favorite out of the bunch, the lamb chop.  It was one of the first meats I tried and it was the last thing I ate.  It was so tender, juicy, and just good.* Signature Garlic Picanha - The crispiness outside edge of the rump cover was so good and tender.  One of our favorites!* Filet Mignon Wrapped in Bacon - It started off tender, but ended up okay in the end.  Stick to the picanha instead!They did have chicken and pork roaming around, but I chose to pass on them this time.  I was too preoccupied with the beef and lamb choices.  I did try a few other meats, but they were less memorable.  There's a couple of dipping sauces for the meats, including the mint one for lamb and something else humming of garlic.  (I got a bit of it on my sleeve and was smelling it the rest of the night!)Service was good and attentive.  They really make an attempt to please you and make sure you leave happy and satisfied.  I don't know how one manages to make it to dessert after you ate so much meat.  The carrot cake alone is a huge three-layer slice!It's definitely the kind of place for hardcore meat lovers ($45/pp) and even vegetarians would do all right if they stuck with the salad bar ($30/pp or so).  Children 6 and under eat free, but 7-12 are half price. RESERVATIONS highly recommended!  You can do that through OpenTable.com too!When you sign up for their eClub, you get a 25% discount (up to a party of 8) if you dine their within the next month!  That's a pretty good deal, especially when celebrating an event.  We'll be back once I recover!4.5 starsA GREAT place for meat lovers =) Meat Heaven! U get ALL you CAN Eat all different types of meats which they bring to you on a stick to eat... =) what more can u ask for?? =)We had some special friends from Seattle roll on through and they wanted some Brazillian BBQ. I had a great experience here on my birthday (see last review) so I felt good about taking them here.  Food was good with lamb still being my favorite. Service is friendly and good, but I think it's hard to top my last experience and still wish I got the guys name because it was inspiring, impeccable service. Sure, it's still pricey and I can't really get behind that often (good thing their eClub gives promotions out fairly often)  but I feel like overall I can count on a satisfying meal here so I'll keep the 5 stars. In the end it's about feeling good at the end of the night with a full belly. Our visitors seemed very happy with it so that to me is always worth a very positive rating. Nothing makes me happier than happy friends.The money to food ratio is very well balanced! I wouldn't normally pay $50 for a buffet, but trust the 5 star rating, it is definitely worth every single dollar! The ambience of the lighting is a bit dim for a buffet, but once the eyes adjust, it's no biggy!I came here on date night with my girlfriend and by the picture of me holding up a lamb chop, you can tell, we were VERY pleased!  The set-up is perfect and service is unique. If you haven't been to a Brazilian-style buffet (Samba inside Mirage), they have servers called "gauchos" that walk around serving the various meats from enormous swords. I recommend you ask your server (not the gauchos) how their little system works, but if you read on, you'll get it from me:Texas de Brazil token of service-- The token that is colored on both sides with either green or red will be your way of controlling the flow of meat to your table. Much like the traffic lights, green means go and red means stop.  So if you're craving for meat, flip that bad boy over to green. If you've had your fill, flip it back to red.  Although in my own experience, they'll still come up to you even if it is red. It may get annoying if you're trying to enjoy your food and you have to tell the gaucho, "No, thank you." with a mouthful.The soup bar is delicious! I enjoyed the Brazilian cheesy bread with the tomato basil soup VERY much! Take your cheesy bread for a dip in the tomato basil and you'll really have something going on! :)  The salad bar has a great selection of cheeses and salads.  The different salads and cold foods are exotic and may not be for most, but hey, if you love food, you'll try anything.  The red meats are VERY tasty and delicious (drooling as I'm imagining the steaks!), the pork is a little dry to me, and the chicken is a bit on the salty side. The only downfall to their almost perfect establishment is that you have to pay for dessert :( Someone should request that dessert be an added feature to the dinner prices!If you haven't yet, sign up on their website for your anniversary date and they give you a BOGO deal on your anniversary! Great + to their already great service and buffet selection!  I will definitely return for another adventure with the gauchos and steaks! YES!Meat heaven.  I wonder how many pounds of meat this place goes through a day?  I've been to this location over 10 times.  First of all there is no reason to EVER pay full price.  Sign up for their email list and they will send you a BOGO coupon for your bday, anniversary, fathers/mothers day (I actually had pictures of my niece stored on my phone in case they asked about our "kids" the first time we used them) and a couple of other days.  Need more coupons?  Use your other email account and set up other bdays!  The coupon doesn't work on Saturday though :(My wife and I were vegetarian for the entire month on January so this was the best place to end it.  Best things on the menu are the filet, lamb chops, any of the sirloins, the flank steak and ummm...more lamb.  Best strategy is to get 4 meats and then flip your thingy to red so at least you can enjoy those pieces while they're hot.  Otherwise you're just barraged by piles and piles of meat and you have no idea what is what. It's a good thing they haven't hired people with Chinese restaurant dim sum experience or this place could get crazy!!!!!!!!Sure it's not the best quality meat but its one of the best places in town to gorge yourself.  Easily one of the top 3 restaurants I would take a friend that has been in prison for 3+ years.How to get a lot of meat inside of youThe Survival Guide of eating at Texas de BrazilBy: Robert S.It's no secret that Brazilian BBQ is expensive, so I decided to put together a survival guide to help you prepare a game plan. Step 1: This place is all you can eat. If you ate a big lunch, take the browns to the Superbowl before you come. Preferably, skip lunch and breakfast before coming here. Step 2: Order water. Ain't no shame in that. Sure Sangria sounds delicious in this hot, dry desert weather, but it's extra and expensive. Step 3: Whoa fatty... go easy on the buffet. It's a good idea to start light and give your stomach a "warm-up". Try to avoid the heavy pastas. Eat some veggies, but make sure you portion control.Step 4: Try not to fill up on the cheesy bread. They're delicious, but filling.Step 5: Identify the filler meats. I did. Avoid the Pork Tenderloin and Beef Ribs. The Pork is a bit bland and the beef ribs are a bit mushy. Stick with the Filet Mignon, Sirloin Steak, Chicken, and Lamp Chops.Step 5a: They have a bacon wrapped Filet Mignon, but I would avoid it. It's greasy and a little salty. I found myself drinking a lot of water. It's still good though, but I prefer the plain filet Mignon.Step 6: Skip dessert. That's extra. Have more fried banana. It's sweet and comes with the meal.Step 7: Don't bring your escort here. Not only does she charge by the hour, but the 60+ dollar dinner is a reimbursable expense. A little about my credentials:I first got into cooking & food when I was in college. After being rejected by numerous girls and getting zero action, I decided it was time for a change. I needed a new makeover to boost my geeky, engineering image. I applied for a cooking position at a Mediterranean-Italian  Restaurant near my home and learned to cook all sorts of pastas and dishes. I never became a professional chef, but I continue to enjoy & love food. 9 years later and 55 lbs heavier, I have a new passion for traveling and trying different foods around the world.Wow! What an improvement!  Service, once the downfall of the restaurant, is now efficient and relaxed.  You are given the time to sit down, look over the drink menu and wine list.  You can enjoy your drink before hitting the excellent salad bar.  You can  have a conversation after you finish your salad without the servers arms reaching in to clear the table the second you put your fork down.  Most amazingly, you can  enjoy a SINGLE cut of meat and a sip of wine without playing the "haha, I flipped the stick to stop one second after the last carver left so back off!) game.Believe it or not, beef taste different from chicken when they are not all piled on top of each other (although the primary flavor is still bacon fat and hickory smoke).Thanks to the slower service, the proteins taste much better.  They do not bleed out on the plate and are much juicer. The only thing I still don't get is the roasted bananas with brown sugar that's offered as a side.  It still taste like a desert to me.The wine selection is excellent.  Prices are very low (near retail).What a difference service makes.  Now, highly recommended.Meat Galore, for real.They have a salad/soup bar in the main room and you basically serve yourself and then there are servers coming around with steaks & chicken of sorts. I am not a big fan of chicken, so I did not bother getting that.  But steaks were all good and amazing. My absolute favorite would be the filet mignon with no bacon. They also serve you fried bananas & mashed potatoes.I loved their fried bananas the best I ever tasted. Mashed potatoes, ehh not so great.Overall, I had a great experience with this place and Im thinking about going back there real soon.TIP: In the salad bar, they have bacon bits and if you love bacon; these are just amazing!The best, the ABSOLUTE BEST in Brazilian BBQ!Being from L.A., I've had my share of great BBBQ places. Fogo de Chao, M Grill, Libra Steakhouse and the non AYCE variety such as Pampas, Bossa Nova, Cafe Brasil, and of course we're known for our plethora of Korean BBQ places too. But the best all you can eat BBQ place I've set foot in is Texas de Brazil. Why you ask? Let's take a step by step journey shall we?First, the place itself is very classy, roomy, very romantically lit (as romantic as plates on plates of red juicy, bloody meat can be anyways), and not too loud. The walls are decorated with lots of artwork, I think it's very well decorated but then again I ain't exactly what youse city folk would consider as "artsy" nor fancy but i do know it's not tacky. Spotting your favorite UFC fighter or Vegas celeb here isn't too uncommon (what's up Wanderlei Silva!). The servers in their gaucho uniforms are very friendly and always super attentive.Secondly, the buffet bar. Wow what selections! Of course you're going to get the usual greens from the salad bar and as always, everything there is very fresh. Asparagus, snow peas, mozzarella, grilled Portobello, olives, baby corn, grilled peppers, etc. Just remember, don't get too excited, it's just frickin' veggies man! The other section offers garlic shrimp, pasta, cheeses, prosciutto, fried plantains (delicious!) and just a lot of other great and satisfying fillers but I sure hope you know better than to fill yourself up with those! One thing you do have to get though is the lobster bisque, man I sip on that the whole night. It's rich, creamy, and just so flavorful. Now for the main event, the MEAT! Picanha, top sirloin, Brazilian sausages, beef ribs, chicken wrapped in bacon, filet mignon, filet mignon wrapped in bacon, flank steak, garlic picanha, lamb chops, leg of lamb, Parmesan chicken, Parmesan pork loin, pork ribs, and pork loin.Oh man, each piece if perfectly seasoned with the right amount of salt and spices. You never feel like you're consuming too much sodium even though that's exactly what you're doing. But you don't get the meat sweats because it's just that perfectly cooked and not at all too oily. My favorite were the pincanha, top sirloin, filet mignon in bacon, and definitely the leg of lamb along with the chops as well. I don't know how many beasts I've consumed at Texas de Brazil but I can assure you, PETA would consider me one of their greatest enemies if they know just how much meat I eat here. The thing that also helps you continually enjoy seconds, thirds, fourths, and so on and so on are the sauces they have for you to dip the meats in. the chimichurri and mint sauces are bomb.com and goes well with pretty much any cut of meat.Lastly, their dessert carts they have rolling around are packed with choices as well. Cheesecake, flan, pies, cakes, and creme brulee galore! Confession though, I honestly didn't try any because I had filled myself up to the throat with meat and lobster bisque and the Brazilian version of Lay's potato chips, the pao de queijo (aka Brazilian cheese bread) because I bet you that you can't have just one. I on the other hand did have just one I think, one basket that is. I love those cheeseballs!Anyway, each person I believe came out to like 50 bucks which is honestly a steal for the quality of meat and everything else at the salad bar that they offer. If you sign up on their website you can get special offers from time to time so might wanna look into that if you're more on the thrifty side. All in all, when in Vegas, screw 90 percent of the buffets on the strip (with the exception of the Bellagio & Wynn ones) and just come on down to Texas de Brazil. Where Texas cattle get the Brazilian treatment (I honestly don't even know where their cattle comes from, I'd just figure I make that connection so it would help me make more sense of the name). Oh wait, just read on their website it's because they combined it with the generous spirit of Texas, close enough. Ok now I'm just talking to myself, but anyways, do yourself a favor and come here if you are a meat lover. If not, stay home you salad eating pansy.So darn glad we tried this place!!!!We ate here for lunch and it was $36.99 per person. They told us that after 3:00 pm the cost for dinner is a but more so I was glad since we were trying it for the first time we got the lunch price.They do offer lesser price for kids.We started with the Salad Bar and I was very impressed with what they had to offer. I never heard of "Grilled Provolone" before and it was too tasty. So many options you wouldn't find at the usual buffet and so so so fresh. They gave us all our own "flip card" that you have turned to Red when you are eating and Green when you are ready for more. They brought us Garlic Filet, Bacon Wrapped Filet, Flank Steak, Bacon Wrapped Chicken, Pork, Lamb, and Sausage.They just keep bringing it to you until you are done. I can't believe for the price you get to keep eating such quality meats.They brought during the meal some "Fried Bananas" to cleanse the palette in between trying the different meats. They also brought some "Garlic Mashed Potatoes" and some delicious little rolls.We all had soda and they came in cute aluminum bottles. I kept 1 for my collection of coke stuff.We didn't eat dessert because we were so stuffed from everything but I am sure it would have been tasty.The inside looks kinda fancy but you don't have to dress up to go here.The service was excellent and we are now hooked and will for sure be back again!I went to Texas de Brazil for my birthday. All the food was high quality especially the meat. There was no wait to be seated at all. They kept the drinks and food coming. Their water was excellent and the meat was well cooked. The only issue I have is that the price was a little high, but it was worth it.Okay...you see the rating.  Here's my review.  Came here to eat last night for one reason...MEAT!!!  With Lent just around the corner, I had only a couple of days before my T-Rex eating days were over for the next 6 weeks.  My date was also excited since there was a 1 1/2 hour wait.  Say What?? She felt that if the wait was that long, the food must be to die for. Well, she was almost right.  I wanted to die after I ate the food. First of all, I've been to just two other Brazilian Steakhouses.  One was in Niagra Falls (can't remember the name because of Mr. Captain Morgan) and the other was Rei De Gado in San Diego.  Both choices were excellent, worth bragging about, and worth the price.  This was my first visit to Texas de Brazil.  I was excited since it's been close to 4 years since my last AYCE meat event.  Not going to describe each item, but I basically got their 2 chicken choices (Parmesan chicken and bacon wrapped chicken breast) and all their red meat selections, including the filet.  I was disappointed because everything was overcooked and salty.  I thought that it may have been the first batch so I got seconds.  Remember, my favorite food is seconds.  Again, dry and salty.  Their Lobster Bisque didn't have pieces of lobster in it. Bisque must mean "Lobster in Spirit" I guess. The meats were so salty, that the salad bar started to look sexy.  And they know it. The Good:-Excellent service:  Pedro is the bestest.  Always asking us how we're doing.  We lied and told him everything was great.  Didn't want to hurt his feelings.  Besides, I was too full of sodium to complain. He still received a good tip because it's not his fault that the food was awful.-Every server was great.  Keep it on green and they are at your table every 3 minutes with food.  Put it on red to put a stop to the madness.  We had it on red most of the night. -The salmon, cheese, and crackers were the highlight.  -Carrot Cake:  Worth the additional $13-The glass of water (Yes, I said glass of water)If I had to rate them just on service alone, they'd get 5 stars easy.  But for $150 for two, salty dry steaks is not my thing.  Where are you Ruth Chris?  I'm coming for you when I'm back in San Diego.  Oops..after Lent that is.This review will probably get lost in the 100s that have preceded it, but I feel like my opinion should be known anyway. That's so Yelpy of me. : )Honestly, it's really not worth it to eat at this restaurant. Great service and pretty good food, but I have had a waaaaay better experience at a churrascaria for way less, I'm talking $26/person for buffet and that restaurant offered snake, alligator, etc. in addition to the normal variety. So, I was not impressed by Texas de Brazil.First of all, their meats weren't very exotic. They had chicken, beef, pork and one lamb variety. They had garlic and bacon-wrapped variations, but that was it. Furthermore, they were "just okay", nothing that made me want to drool.Rice, mashed potatoes, and the bananas were very good side dishes, but you are at this restaurant for the meat, right? My favorite thing was the pão de queijo AKA cheesy, soft, delicious, heavenly bread.We got free cake. It was our anniversary and my man's birthday just a few days before. That was a nice touch, so I did write a raving review about my waitress on the comment card. But, unless I have a coupon, I won't be coming back here.I would skip breakfast and lunch before coming here...and wear loose clothing.With green/red colored discs you have the power to command gauchos with swords of meat to circle your table as they tempt you with different meats...from sausage, to pork, to chicken, to filet oh my! You can also request meats to your specific temperature liking. You come to eat MEAT but the salad bar is irresistible with items such as lobster bisque, asparagus, prosciutto, and the big wheel of imported parmesan cheese that makes you feel like a mouse that's died and gone to cheese heaven...the salad bar is a cruel distraction to the main meat event but worth at least one trip. I make sure to have enough chimichurri for my meat so I don't make multiple trips. This is an insane meatfest but the warm Brazilian cheese bread served at your table is too wonderful to resist...light and chewy balls that I could easily pop all night. Let's face it, you leave your diet and calorie counter at the door when you eat here. The bananas are also a nice treat. Service is always fantastic and be sure to mention if celebrating a special occasion and they will bring out a dessert for the birthday person. Had a papaya something that was very good and different from anything I've had before. Turn your disc over to red once you've had your fill and the gauchos leave you alone.A wonderful dining experience.If I could give more than 5 stars I would.  Texas de Brazil serves heaven on a plate!  If you haven't been to a Brazilian Steakhouse, it's a never ending delivery of meat on swords.   We have been to other Brazilian Steakhouses such as Samba at the Mirage.  But they do not compare to this one at Town Square.Now I try to be a healthier eater with little bits of 'treats' mixed in.  They have a great salad bar that also comes with the meats.  On the salad bar, I found everything to be delicious and delectable.  There, of course, is green salads. What is a salad bar without actually having salads.  BUT WAIT!  You could possibly eat on the salad bar alone with the smoked salmon, spicy shrimp salad, variety of cheeses, cous cous, mushrooms, grilled peppers, LOBSTER BISQUE and more.  Now I put Lobster Bisque in all caps because it made so creamy and full of flavor! I couldn't get enough!My husband completely skipped the salad bar and had all meats.  (Midwest Boy!).  They brought Chicken sprinkled with parmesan,lamb,  filet, filet wrapped in bacon, pork ribs, beef ribs, flank steak, sirloin steak and much more than I just can't remember.  All I know is that it was so good!  The beef ribs especially were my favorite.  The meat was so tender and it melted like butter in your mouth.  If that wasn't enough food for you, they also bring rolls and a side of mashed potatoes for the table.  They also offer some really yummy looking desserts but who has room after all of that food?!  If this review doesn't make you hungry for it, then my review has failed. Just writing about it makes me want to go back again.  If you are in the mood for alot of great food, this should be the place on top of your list! Will I be back again?  You better believe it!So, they offer a free meal here for your birthday if you sign up for their enewsletter. Who am I to say no to free food, so I came here  to take full advantage of the fabulous deal.We came here to celebrate my birthday and dad a great evening. We were seated quickly and surprised by how busy the restaurant was on a Monday evening.Our waitress was very attentive and gave us the whole spiel about where everything f was and how the process works. We started with the salad bar. Pretty good. The soup was nothing special, so steer clear of that. On to the meat. Lots and lots of meat. The good thing about coming in with a coupon was that I didn't feel compelled to overdo it with food. My tummy thanked me for that afterward. The stars of the show are the picanha and lamb chops. The beef ribs and top sirloin were solid too. Service was amazing. Very friendly and attentive. Plantains were replenished regularly. These were probably my favorite part of the meal. All in all, a great meal was had by all and we will definitely be back for future birthdays with coupons in hand!Amazing experience! I've been here a few times, and each time it gets better and better. Start out with the salad bar, but I try to be careful not to fill up on cheese and salad. Standouts for me are the Manchego cheese wheel, smoked provolone, cherry peppers, and of course I love the Caesar salad with fresh grated Parmigiano cheese on top.Now on to the meats... so yummy. I have to admit I was so busy enjoying everything that I failed to make sure I knew exactly what meats I was eating. My absolute favorite selection is the beef ribs. It was by far the most tender meat... seriously so delicious. I couldn't get enough! I also really enjoyed the filet. It's so easy to gorge yourself on everything. My boyfriend really liked the Parmesan crusted chicken, but honestly, I learned something about myself... Once I've eaten a great piece of red meat, I don't see any reason to eat chicken. Next time I need to remember to try the chicken pieces first. There was another great cut of meat that I loved, but I'm not sure what kind. They serve it with three round cuts of meat on the skewer, and when they slice it off it comes out in a sort of circle. It is charred on the outer edge, with a layer of fat followed by the red meat inside. It was so flavorful. I'm usually a little wary of fatty pieces, but this was out of this world. My boyfriend ordered a bloody mary and I got the red sangria. Both of us were really happy with our choice. We also splurged and ordered two desserts because we couldn't agree. He ordered the key lime and I got the bananas fosters pie. I thought mine was absolutely delicious, but of course he thought his was better. Both were really good. Side note: the hostess was not very friendly. She didn't smile or seem to be very welcoming. I just expect to be greeted with a smiling, happy face when I walk into a restaurant. She was all business, not rude, but very serious.Meat lovers paradise!  Leave your diet and concerns about cholesterol at the door because it's gonna be a crazy flavorful ride!My friend's wedding reception was held at the beautiful and swanky Texas de Brazil!  I will admit that I was a bit apprehensive about how a wedding reception at an all-you-can-eat place would be but it was amazing!  After asking for the strongest knock-ya-on-ya-kissah Sangria, we headed out of the intimate and gorgeous banquet room they reserved for the wedding party and out into the salad bar area.They had gourmet cheeses, artisan breads, a wide array of salads, fancy olives, and all these delicious sides to offer and it was hard to pull yourself away but you got to remember that there's a parade of meats coming up and you definitely don't want to miss that!  So after loading up and consuming a fairly modest dish of cheeses and olives, the night became a symphony of skewers upon skewers of deliciously grilled meats.  Oh my.The waiters seemingly danced through the tables and offered succulent and juicy grilled meats onto our dishes and even politely suggested a few off the menu items they'll sneak in for us.  You would think that with a bridal party hogging up their banquet room for hours on end, they might get angry and try to kick us out but no.  Glasses were always filled, boxes of fancy teas were offered to the more modest ladies, and the food just wouldn't stop!  Please stop!  My waistline!  Texas de Brazil is an impressive and trendy restaurant with the most down-to-Earth people --- rare for a Las Vegas eatery!Hot damn! This place is great!I've been to rodizio spots where all you get is meats, unlimited salad... and fries or rice with your meal. Bleh. Here, you have access to a plethora of other foods. Cheeses, salads, soups, sides, sushi; pretty much an entire buffet on its own s'all there. The staff was quite accommodating (we ate A LOT) and even brought out a free dessert for a birthday at the table (the dessert is HUGE too). Obviously the main player here is the meats and they do a great job with them. Some are bacon wrapped, crusted, stuffed or just plain ol beef, but regardless of preparations, they're all tender and filled with flavor. Even the sausage and ribs had an excellent smokey bite. Seriously, come here if you need a food coma. They give you a card so your server knows whether to fill your plate with the latest offering and I think our entire table had it turned to green for a good 90 min straight. Good times. Can't wait for round 2... (in 2015 when I'm not so full anymore). Bonus: Saw Flavor Flav in the houuussseee.I have to give this restaurant 1 star because of a single employee's lack of interest in doing her job. A friend and I went into the restaurant a few days ago to see if they were open for lunch. We saw a young woman working at the podium and asked if they were open. She was on the phone, looked at us, and held up 5 fingers. Not being sure if that meant to wait just a minute, we stood there and waited. After maybe 3 minutes, she showed no intention of helping us or even getting off the phone. She wouldn't even look at us as I made it clear that we were looking for the website to see if they were open. She was on the phone still, now laughing at the conversation. It sounded like a personal call. I asked once again "so you guys aren't open?", and got completely ignored. So we left, not able to dine there since we weren't able to find out from them if or when they'd open. We could smell food cooking from outside, so we assumed they were open. After we left, we took our business to a nearby competing restaurant, and I had probably best steak I've ever had in my life there (Filetto Di Manzo Toscano at Brio Tuscan Grille). I recommend everyone try the steak there. The service is also far superior, as their employees aren't making personal phone calls and ignoring customers.  I would have liked to try Texas de Brazil, but honestly with such a bad first impression, it doesn't seem like it's worth it.This happened on Tuesday, September 9th, around 12:35pm.  I would encourage management to look into who was working the podium at that time and have a talk with her about priorities.I forgot how much I really LOVE this place!We use to go here alot, but it may have been almost two years since I've last been.I'm really glad I revisited!The meats, the saltiness, the variety of sides, the sangria! .. I really don't know what more to ask for! My favorite meat has got to be their house special - Piccanya (?).It's melt in your mouth, tender, fatty goodness! Also, their flank steak was delicious that night! They a variety of different beefs, porks, lambs and chickens always in a rotation. As long as you leave your little card green, they're going to keep coming!As far as their sides they have soup, salads, meats, cheeses, breads, sauces.. and this is really silly, but their Jasmine rice here is soooo AMAZING! Maybe it's just the Filipino in me that really enjoys eating rice and meat BUT I can't get enough of it.. That's really all I eat as far as the sides!Our sangria was mixed well and paired with our meal! I believe it was $25 for a whole pitcher (about 6 glasses) compared to the $10 per glass.Also can't complain about their service .. Attentive and friendly!I can't wait for my next visit!Meat lovers this is the place for you! I look forward to TDB every year for my birthday, even though they no longer give you a free meal on your birthday, because it's damn worth it! A lot of people complain about them not giving the free birthday meal anymore and I was pissed at first too but hey they still send email offers with discounts so it's all good. It's around $50 per person for dinner and a bit cheaper at lunch time. It's worth every penny! If I had my way I'd just start with the meat and skip the salad bar however my wife really looks forward to the salad bar here and I always end up finding some meats and cheeses to grub on. The salad bar has tons of things and everything is fresh. You can just pay around $20 for the salad bar if that's all you want but why the hell come to TDB for just the salad bar? MEAT! The meat is boss here. Service is excellent and the meat is never ending. This last visit I must have had 8 different types of meat! I'm not much of a chicken eater but the bacon wrapped chicken here is so flavorful. I can't get enough of the bacon wrapped filet either. One thing I could stand to not see while I'm enjoying a nice meal is some lady breastfeeding her kid. Let me say that I have no issue when it comes to a mother feeding her child but I'm not paying good money to see it, this kid looked 3 years old, and I saw this ladies bare tatas several times throughout my meal. I'm positive the bathroom would have been more appropriate! I'm also sure when the kid has teeth that can bite you back that you should give the kid a damn cup to drink from! Our server was great and checked on us often. They give you round cards that you flip to red if you don't want anymore meat and you flip to green when you do want more. They have men going around with several types of meats and are great about bringing you the types of meats you like and cooked the way you like. The bar has really good HH deals too. TDB is well worth the money and I'll definitely be back.

We had a minimal layover, a mere 25 mins, before we were scheduled to fly to Omaha, Nebraska. Since we were pressed for time, we opted to grab a quick bite at this bagel place (despite it being #nationaldonutday).The prices were typical for your usual airport eatery-- expensive for what you get. For about 7 dollars you got a normal sized bagel sandwich. My family and I got the Las Vegas Special, a breakfast sandwich w/ meat and cheese on top of a plain bagel. It was okay, nothing extremely spectacular. They do not season anything, so unless you prefer bland food-- don't forget to grab some pepper, hot sauce, or salt on the bar after paying. (Which ironically was labelled as being from Burger King!) Customer service was average; nothing horrible, but again, nothing amazing.The location is past the slots, next to the Wentzel Pretzel stand.. Close to where C2 boards.

I found a goodie...and it's my new 'go-to' thai place in the new hood... yay!Thanks to Alexander and Jennifer's reviews, I decided to check out La's Thai Cuisine on Saturday night.  I was with Cindy C for the first visit (I actually went back a few nights later to do take-out on my own).  The place is adorable - it's in a shady little shopping center so I was glad we called to confirm the location before attempting to find it.  Soo (that's how she told us she spells her name) was our server - she may also be the owner.  She is sweet as can be.  Beware - everything is on the spicy side... I like it that way; we ordered medium spice and it was a tad much for CIndy.  The fresh rolls are fantastic - the basil stands out and they really do taste fresh!  The special salad (which I ordered during both my visits) comes with ginger dressing and it's a huge serving - just how i like it!  We also had the pad see-ew and mixed veggies with tofu.    With tip out the door, our first dinner was $20 each.  My take out for a big salad and entree (mixed veggies with tofu and I requested they add eggplant) was $16.  Not bad!I can't wait to explore more of what La's Thai has to offer - just don't tell too many people about it; I love these quiet little thai places just how they are!I'm pleasantly surprised that La's is still in business... they are usually empty when I come in.  I've ordered mostly take out from La's over that last few months... and I've been extremely happy with quantity, quality, an cost!My latest order was the mixed veggies, add eggplant, light oil, and medium spice - yum!  I also had one order of the fresh summer rolls with shrimp.  Yum!I love both these dishes because they are tasty and light... I will continue to order from La's again and again... I hope that one day on a future visit, they will be packed.  They deserve it!  Craving thai cuisine?  Head over to La's!

A neighborhood joint that we pass by all the time.  Coupons for this place come all the time, so we figure we may as well give it a go.The restaurant is split up into two sections - dining in establishment on the left, bar area o the right.  They start you off with tortilla chips, salsa, and a bean dip while they get your drink orders in.The Husband ordered the Mexican Pizza (Large $10.45).  It's your choice of protein with all the standard fixings of Mexican food piled onto a crispy tortilla.  I went for the Combination Plate (3 Items for $9.95), and chose an enchilada, tamale, and soft taco.  For the most part, you can choose your own filling (a few cost extra) and sauce on them.  With it, you get rice and beans.  When the order came out, we thought they were both pretty generous.  Unfortunately for me, the requested low-fat green cilantro rice and low-fat boiled pinto beans were not replacing the red rice and refried beans I had asked for.  The waiter immediately took it back and they fixed the problem.  (Not sure if it was the waiter's fault or the kitchen's fault, but it was done quickly without too much drama.)My enchilada and tamale were both tasty, although the chicken soft taco was a bit dry.  That was probably my least favorite part of the dish.  It made for good leftovers the next day.They also have a Lite Menu, specials for those 60 years and older, gaming promos, and more.Service was fine. It wasn't too busy on a weekday for lunch, so no real problems there.Overall, it's a decent place for lunch when you want some Mexican food.  It helps when you find those BOGO coupons that come along though!

I have to admit.  I think I'm in love.  -Her name is JenniPho and she's from Vegas.  -She took good care of me when I was there. -She plays modern rock from the 80's.-She dresses nicely with neutral colors and rattan furnishings.   -She's clean.  She even has a large window so I can see how clean her kitchen is and what she does in it.  -Her broth is excellent in her Pho Dat Biet (combo).  Even her beef balls impressed me!  With wonderful flavor and texture, it's evident that she uses fresh and high quality ingredients.  Too bad she doesn't offer a bigger bowl!-Her eggroll wasn't bad, and her grilled honey chicken was nice and gingery.-Oh, and she only takes cash!I have to see her every time I visit the desert!Just A-Ok Pho in Las Vegas but very good place in the southwest area of Las Vegas (because they don't have anyone around this area)! What I think: DO NOT try Tomato soup pho! I was so disappoint because it smelled seafood not tomato at all and very oily.. this is a big NO NO NO to me (that's the reason why I throw up after ate here) !Also, I'm not very happy with their Spring Roll ( since I'm a big fan of it and after I tried it in many differnt Pho restaurant) !However, I'll come again.... let's see.... hope it will be much better....Hoping this place would be great, I have experienced better! Little did we know, the customer service was very poor, alongside the food! They sold a chicken noodle soup, but it was not in chicken broth! The chicken noodle soup was in BEEF broth! My cousin also ordered her pho, and it tasted like gingerbread was mixed into it. My order of pho was very watered-down! On to the next one for me!

Please forgive me Yelp, for I have Chained.  It has been several months since my last descent into this red and white striped den of flair and prefabricated food.  This brazen purveyor of pseudo-good times and siren-like enticements of forbidden Jack Daniels sauce and greasy potato skins.  Again it beckoned to me at a time of weakness, sending upon me of all things...coupons.  Coupons of an almost vibrant nature.  This will not do.I maintain that I am not a regular consumer of red meat, but a couple times a month (no, not those times) I just have a taste for a burger.  I was hungry, the coupon was there on the table with the Sunday paper, colorful and bold.  I yielded.  We went.  We threw ourselves upon the harsh and jagged rocks of corporate commercial enterprise, somehow expecting that this time, yes, certainly this time, a dry and welcoming dock of quality and wholesomeness would appear.  Alas, our hopes were dashed yet again upon the vicious and uncaring granite of the soulless entity even as my wallet was washed aside, cleaned of thirty-odd dollars.I suppose I must come clean with the bitter and thankless details lest the Yelp deign that I am not repentant for my shameless forays into chaining:I had the cheesy bacon cheeseburger because if you only have a big honkin' burger a couple times a month you should do it up.  I did not fully understand the menu (I'm sticking with that story) and was surprised to find that part of the cheesy monstrosity was...fried cheese.  Bacon, cheese, burger and fried cheese.  I take some small solace in the fact that I was unable to best the cheese cheesy beasty and left nearly a third on the table.  I expect that will sate the occasional cheeseburger madness for months to come.  Overall it was an average to less than average burger.My children, for I did not spare the young, had buffalo wings which were reported to be very good, and a kids cheeseburger, which was reported to be...OK.  Nay, even not did I spare my spouse the torment of chaining, for she too was bewitched, and nearly missed being struck down by a pillar of salt.  A very small pillar.  Actually, it was just a salt shaker and it only fell in her lap but that's irrelevant.No, for my wife, fair though she may be, and long possessing of patience, no she too was possessed by the demon burger madness and partook of the very same wicked concoction which nearly bested myself at the very same table.  And hers as well was reported to be...OK.But it was with the youngest that thy peculiarities began, for the milk it was off.  No, not quite spoiled, just...off.  And off with it went the server, to return with nearly the same beverage and yet it was different somehow.  It was chocolate milk, pretty much.  Server, server!  Verily he did beseech unto us; "Is there but more that I may do for you?  Thou hast but to request and it shall be done if it be within thy powers here in this realm of wall mounted chachka's!"  Even did he say to our consternation, "Let me know if there is anything out of the ordinary you need me to take care of."  Looks we did exchange, the kind and forgiving spouse and I, looks that contained so much and could be best summed up with the phrase: "Huh?"So yes, chain we did.

It's a bit disappointing when a restaurant (or a person, or a job, or a movie, for that matter) doesn't live up to its potential. This Firebirds has a lot going for them: decent sized menu, great location in SouthPark, pretty outdoor patio and nice, attentive service. But even with all of these seemingly nice features, the main component - the food - falls short. I enjoyed a lunch on the patio and while it's lovely, there isn't much of a view. Maybe I'm just too short, but all I saw were shrubs in my face. I ordered the fish tacos made with Mahi Mahi, served with roasted almond couscous. Sounded pretty damn tasty, and for $11 I went for it. While the couscous was generous in portion and toasted almond-y flavor, the fish tacos (the entire point of the meal) left a whole lot to be desired. For one, there were two tiny cubes of fish on each taco - I ate much more slaw than fish. But the main issue? The fish was incredibly salty...so salty I was downing my water and could hardly taste the flaky Mahi Mahi underneath. Sad fish. I ate the couscous instead. I think I'll head back to Firebirds for a cocktail at the bar...that seems to be more up my alley!Firebirds was our third choice for lunch after the first two places were closed for the holiday weekend. And I can see why those places were closed, as there was very little going on today. We were one of only three tables occupied the whole time we were eating our late lunch.We opted to skip an appetizer and enjoyed the tasty bread while we waited for lunch to arrive. It didn't take long. My wife had the French Dip which had a nice big bowl of jus for dipping. I had a standard cheeseburger (I think the waiter misheard me as I wanted the blue cheese burger, but it worked out okay). Both came with awesome fries that were perfect. I mean, really, really perfect fries.Nice comfortable restaurant. Enjoyable.

Review Text :
Mi casa es la casa de las enchiladas! YUMMALICIOUS!  After reading Julia S, Chad E and Faith D's thumbs up reviews, I knew I was on my way.  I went with one of my friends and we ordered a plate of four enchiladas and some flank steak thrown on for good measure!  I don't know which one was my favorite, all I know is that I could not cram it down my mouth fast enough, it was delicious. I guess if I had to choose, the mole and the verde were my favorite.   I might want to go back very soon.Any restaurant that I walk in and I am the only honky, hot salsa, fresh jalapenos and servers that barely speak English.  Dude, I'm there.  Oh, wait, also coke in the bottle. Yay!!Disclaimer, some servers speak English, just ours didn't.  Fun visit.Disclaimer Part Deux: The restaurant formally known as La Casa de la Enchilada is now Three Amigos. Same location and same great food!!!Holy guacamole!  I love this restaurant, I have already written a review and proclaimed my love, but I want to spread the good word on this new name page too.I went in last night after an afternoon at the Thirsty Beaver, it was better than normal.  I couldn't believe it, sometimes you love restaurants but it looses it's charm after a couple of visits, not this one.I had never ordered the queso, it had sauteed onions and chorizo. I might have to get that every visit.  It's tiny, the perfect amout for two people.Then BORING, I ordered what I always order, enchiladas verde.  I can't help myself. If you like hot stuff, call me.  no really, make sure you ask for their hot salsa, it taste like pureed hot peppers and avocado blended. It will light you up, just like the Thirsty Beaver.Don't forget to order imported Coke with real sugar.Te amo, Three Amigos. Te amo.I've been putting down a fair share of Mexican food as of late and I was just delighted to finally drop by Three Amigos. If you're looking for a fancy pants Mexican establishment, don't waste your time here. But if you're like me and on occasion you crave delicious, authentic and affordable Mexican fare with a low-key atmosphere, consider this as good as it gets in Charlotte.The daily drink specials are bangin' especially $5 jumbo margaritas on Fridays. But don't worry, every other day they are only $6 each. Prepare yourself that they are delicious. And.huge. And.full.of.alcohol. The service is kind, warm and friendly. There are a handful of servers who speak enough English to effectively jot down your order and if not, well, work on your Espanol, kid.And the food. Delicioso, compadre. I've sampled a few different things here but I really enjoy their guacamole - full of flavor and cilantro. Next time I may ask if they can make it spicy, too! Their tacos (soft corn) are tasty and, again, garnished with a smattering of spice and cilantro. The chicken was succulent and well prepared and I also tried a shredded beef enchilada. Taaaaasty. Portions as a whole are pretty generous and, inevitably, I always leave this place seeking a siesta. I definitely want to come back and try a few other items...perhaps mole next time?!Damn you Three Amigos...I knew it would happen if I saw you, but still I had to try. Replay 1 hour before dinner decision... Wife...let's have Mexican tonight. Me...Eh. Wife...What? Three Amigo's is good and cheap. Me...yeah, but I always overeat at Mexican restaurants Wife...So don't eat everything on your plate Me...I can't help myself, I've tried. Those damn combos kill me. Wife...laughs...you have a problem Me...at least I admit it 1 hour 28 minutes later, I'm full after chips & quac (good guac!) and my chimichanga "combo". So good...so much food...and only $8. Add in a large margarita and bottle of beer and I am full. Yep...did it again. I left some rice and beans for whoever took my plate though. Three Amigo's is a great spot in Plaza that has a few small tables and a wall of booths. Don't be afraid of the so-so strip mall exterior, this place has great cheap food. It's also open until 4am on Friday & Saturday's. Good lord, if I'm there that late I know I won't have any room left from the night's PBR's, but as I know, I'll still stuff my face with good Mexican food. Damn you Three Amigo's! :)Dropped in here on a big ole' Unofficial Yelper Field Trip to conduct a little reconnaissance on the current state of affairs of this little restaurant that could.  After sampling the wares, Three Amigos needs to change its name 'cause it just gained a new friend.Started things off with a trio of salsa/dips and some lightly seasoned tortilla chips.  While even the red salsa was nicely done, the real stars were the tomatillo sauce and especially the green sauce blend of jalapenos and avocados.  This alone sets Amigos apart from the rest of the Mexican fare pact in town.Also got to try the guacamole.  Nice and smooth, with a good blend of flavors, though I'd like it to have a little more kick with the spiciness.  Best part of all, a nice-sized boat of guac clocks in at just $3.75.  That's less than half the price of fancier places that mix it at your table- and as far as I'm concerned, I'll do without the show where the flavors are so good.Entrees all looked good, but I tried out their pure vegan fare, and many props to them for giving this a go.  I had a trio of tostadas with beans, zucchini, and still more veggies.  I now know it is totally possible to eat Mexican without the cheese and sour cream.  Veggie fajitas and enchiladas verdes are also available in both a vegan and a vegetarian variety, though not listed as such on the menu- just ask the staff.Loved the friendly atmosphere here from the waitresses right over to the manager, who checked in on us several times.  Also loved the fact the there is a mix of Latinos and gringos who stop in to dine here- a good sign you have come to the right place for serious eats.By the way, if you are jonesin' for some authentic street food late at night, Three Amigos recently launced a late-night menu from 10 PM till 4 AM on Fridays and Saturdays.  Empanadas, chimi-churris and quipe.  Sounds like it's time for another reconnaissance mission- late-night style!I lived down Central from Three Amigos for about 2 years. Let's just say that I could never have frequented this place enough. It's a perfect shining mexican flagship for the Plaza area. Nestled in a dive-y little strip (thus, parking can be a bit of a problem on busy nights) and quaint/understated. Three Amigos is definitely a go-to for authentic Mexican in Charlotte. The pros outweigh the cons tenfold for this place. The only negatives to report, which I'm pretty sure everyone has experienced, is the service. You might wait for a half hour for your app/entree or MUCH longer with no whisper of timeframe, and its iffy you'll be able to communicate a need for a swift dining experience. This can be a bit annoying for some diners. I'd recommend hitting up Three Amigos when you've got some time to kill. This place gets SLAMMED, too. Kick back and take advantage of the humongous margaritas. The food is to die for. I've never had better queso fundido. Definitely worth the $4 to pair with the fresh salsa and chips. We heartily enjoyed every last drop and even used what was left on our entrees. Bistec a la Mexicano was incredible. So many sautéed veggies and perfectly seasoned steak with rice and all of the standard Mexican accouterment. So much on my plate it was hard to consume all of the goodness in one sitting. My compliments to the chef on this dish. Incredible flavors. Un Chile Relleno will make you melt. The only thing I could say is that I wish it were "Dos" Chile Rellenos. Filled with amazing cheese and avocado. Prices are rather fair for the level of flavor and execution. Love this spot in Plaza. Whenever I crave Mexican, Three Amigos is what I think of first. ¡Ole!OMG, it's no wonder this place is packed during prime hours.  The food is literally the best Mexican I've tried thus far.  I used to think Azteca held the crown but the power has swung full swing into Three Amigos' hands!  Reading the reviews I too had to try the margaritas.....delicious!  I had the enchiladas (came with 3) for my main meal and it was equally divine.Important to know about this place is, yes it's campy inside, yes it's crowded but believe me it's worth it!We have crowned a winner for Nikki's favorite Mexican restaurant in Charlotte. Three Amigos, I hope you have a victory speech prepared.Let's start with the chips and salsa. Can't.stop.eating.these.chips. What are these things laced with? I haven't had the guac here yet. Why? Because I have a massive crush on the cheese dip. Get it with onions.I usually stuff myself full with all of the above, but somehow manage to force down some of my meal. I love the enchiladas. All of the enchiladas. Plates are huge. Huge and delicious.Typically, I just get a water when I'm here. Hello, I need to save room for all the chips. However, on Fridays the big margaritas are on special. Who can say no to a giant margarita?! Yes, it's in a little shopping center on Central. Yes, all the neighboring businesses have bars on the windows. Yes, the sign on the convenience store next door reads "Do Not Enter with Mask or Hoodie." Don't let any of this stop you from visiting Three Amigos. Trust me, you'll thank me.So i have a new friend in town from Texas.  We were in the mood for Mexican, however he said he wanted AUTHENTIC Mexican.  I had never been to Three Amigos but had seen the line out the door many times when I drive by.   After being super disappointed at a couple other competitors my last few visits, i suggested that we try this place.  we arrived at 6....and thankfully not a minute later because the  people started piling in....and there was LOTS OF THEM! .We each had 2 margaritas. ...which set us up right.  Delicious and refreshing and provided a nice buzz.Chips were pretty good and had Seasoning on them.  I like the fact that they serve their salsa in a deep bowl so you don't really run out quickly.  The salsa was not hot at all...however, the flavor was decent. We both got the Mixed Fajitas with Chicken, Steak and shrimp.  Perfectly seasoned, not greasy at all, and a mountain of food.   YUM!We also had a complementary Empanada from the Yelp app.  It was basically deep fried ground  beef and queso.  Had good flavor when it was hot.....but we had so much food at the table, i only ate a couple bites of it.  By the time we left....the restaurant was extremely packed with lots of people crowding the door which is by the bar...and everyone was getting their drink on.  But we never felt rushed to leave.I will definitely go back for dinner here in the future....as it was authentic...and very good!Been in CLT for 13 years .....hate ive not come sooner.GO! Just go.........and make sure that it's on a Friday. Why? Grande sized house Margaritas are $5 each. I always drink two, because they are Fergalicious!!!Be warned.....they are both delicious and potent, which are both good things in my book. After two 'Ritas yesterday, I had a little trouble walking for a second or two. Other random thoughts.....WIBBLY WOBBLYMy initial booth's table was so wobbly that it wasn't possible to eat at that table. I asked to move to an adjacent booth. My waitress complied with no comment, other than a smirk. If that table had been a horse, ala 1950's westerns, "they" would have shot it in the head to put it out of it's misery. MARGARITASecondly, you ARE going to want a second Margarita. Even though they are large, my first one was almost gone before my food arrived. How large you ask? I got in a pretty good arm curl workout drinking those 'Ritas. Curl. Sip. "Ahhhh." Curl. Sip. "Ahhhh." Repeat. Feel the burn!Three Amigos' Margaritas are made with freshly squeezed lime juice, good tequila, triple sec, lime and orange slices, and a ton of salt on the rim. My waitress, who was also serving as the bartender, showed me their placard as having been selected Charlotte's BEST Margarita. The two that I had were the best in recent memory, so I don't dispute their claim. (They are also made QUICKLY!) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/three-amigos-mexican-restaurant-and-cantina-charlotte?select=xVPIVNwRtkg83jlm2N_2aAGUAC ME, BABY!A MUST is ordering their chunky guacamole with pico de gallo, because it is amazing! I always get a small, appetizer size, portion to go along with the chips and salsa. I have never eaten better guac. The appetizer size is plenty for one, but for two or more people you'll need to order a larger sized portion. CHIPS, AND SALSA, AND GUAC.....OH, MY!Oh, speaking of the chips and salsa....the chips come out warm and covered in some type of red spice. They are good.The salsa "appears" to be homemade, and it is filled with bits of onions, tomato, and chiles. I have not had better gratis salsa anywhere else. I usually add a little hot sauce for good measure.TACOSEntree: I ordered the TACOs AL PASTOR today for a change. They were just "okay." Three Amigos scrimps on their taco filling as it is, but there were only one or two pieces of pineapple in both tacos. The flavor was also not as good as their charcoal grilled tasting carne asada tacos, which are very good. I still have not found an entree dish that has blown me away yet, but I'm still hopeful. The carne asada tacos are $7.95, and the tacos al pastor are $8.95. Both are too expensive for the meager portions received compared to other places. To offset that a bit.....the refried beans and yellow rice are wonderful. I cleaned my plate, which I rarely do in a Mexican restaurant. SERVICE? Usually good to excellent.ATMOSPHERE? Loud! The Hispanic music here reminds me of an 80's Latin disco dance party. This place rocks! There is Tele-MUN-DO comedies on the TV, which get funnier and funnier as the Margaritas go sippy sippy. CUANTO CUESTA? Expect to pay $20+ per person, IF you go full tilt boogie and order a little bit of everything, including a couple of drinks. I like to splurge once in awhile, without worrying about prices. I used to go to a good steak house, but more and more lately I find myself craving tacos, great guac, and grande Margarita(s). Maybe I'll see you there next Friday.

The sign caught my eye and I was interested in seeing what this new restaurant had to offer. I was surprised they opened this up in the same shopping center as Swish, another Shabu Shabu restaurant.  The décor was beautiful with nice dark brown tones and orange highlights.  The restaurant has an all you can eat BBQ menu for only $20 or you can order the Yakiniku service which includes a combination of meat and vegetables for the whole table.  They also serve their meet Shabu Shabu style.  So basically, you're cooking at your own table.  I've been to others, but the way they marinated their meat was so tasty.  I recommend the all you can eat menu at $20 as the best value.  They also have a Karaoke bar connected by a hallway that shares bathrooms.  The only problem is, it gets smoky in there.  I wasn't too happy with their ventilation system, hence the 4 stars.

Review Text :
In my search to the ends of the Valley for hidden gems for great food I've found a pocket of Asian ethnicity in Mesa.Mekong Plaza opened in October 2008 on the southwest corner of Dobson and Main. Formerly an empty Target store, it has been converted into an Asian mall with Mekong Market as the anchor. The plaza houses three Vietnamese restaurants, one Thai and the Taiwanese place, Taiwan Food Express.If you're unfamiliar with Taiwanese food, that would make two of us.While Taiwan Food Express does have a China-merican menu with typical offerings, I'd suggest ordering from the regular menu and the specials menu. This will give you food that seems authentic and interesting.This was probably one of the most exciting dinners I've had in quite some time. Taiwanese cooking has many influences including regional, ethnic and cultural influences. So in order to taste the diversity, we ordered as many dishes as the table could hold and then some.If you're not feeling too brave, feel free to ask for suggestions, the employees here know all the good stuff. Our server, Jessica, made some great suggestions as we pulled a feast together. And at these prices - nothing is more than $10 -- feast away!The Spicy Wontons ($2.50) are filled with tender seasoned ground pork then laid to rest in spicy chili oil. They were so tasty we ended up ordering a second plate.Not being able to resist any sort of food challenge, we tried the Simmered Pig Ear ($2.50). It was funny to watch the look on the faces of each of my dining companions as they raised the wiggly sliced ears to their mouths. These were more of a texture food than a taste food. The ear skin was super tender while the center cartilage was on the crunchy side. Challenge won.Less challenging was the scrumptious Beef Roll ($3.95). A tender pancake rolled around tender sliced beef with a slathering of sweetened soy sauce was slightly oily, but nothing a napkin couldn't fix.The Scallion Pancake ($2.25) had a decent crunch and made a great bread to go along with the upcoming entrees.A less adventurous diner might order the familiar Orange Chicken ($6.50). It's good choice here. The tender batter covered fried chicken was accented by a thick and pungent sauce. The portion size was huge and dwarfs any I've seen elsewhere.A favorite was the House Style Chicken with Fresh Basil ($6.50). This dish was made from pieces of bone-in chicken, then covered with fresh basil. It was plate licking good.Pork Belly with Sour Vegetable ($6.50) sounded good, but the sourness of the vegetables was off-putting. Perhaps it's an acquired taste?The boiled Hi-Nan Chicken Rice ($5.95) was tender, and when dipped into the garlic and ginger sauce it was out of this world.Another textural delight was Stir-Fried Rice Cake with Salted Vegetables ($5.95). Each bite of rice cake resembled a large piece of rice and, while subtle in flavor, had an addictive chewiness.There are so many dishes to try that it will take a few visits to get through the menu, but with prices this low and service this friendly, it's worth a few trips.I've been eating lunch in the Mekong Plaza for a long time now and just found a new kickass place for my hungry taste buds to enjoy.The menu here is very large and they have both Americanized versions as well as some more authentic Taiwanese and Chinese choices.Came here for the first time and ordered the House Style Chicken with Basil and a Beef Roll on the side. They both had some really nice flavors and the large portions were probably more than what was needed before going back to work. ZZZzz!There are several ways to get filled up here. Dim Sum, Soups, Appetizers, Sauteed Dishes and a huge selection of Noodles and Rice specialties.Service was friendly and very quick. There are some photos available to choose from or you can just point at a picture on your phone like yours truly.Can't wait to come back and try out some more of their tasty dishes. They even have some really inexpensive choices for those on a budget. CHOP CHOP!4 STARS

Review Text :
I really like Sygn, and I have enjoyed visiting for Friday night drinks and for a quiet Tuesday dinner and cocktail night with fellow Yelpers. It has a convenient location tucked away in the West End (although I find the street a bit dirty and dodgy, although perfectly safe). Based on its location, it has West End cocktail prices but I love the extensive menu of a huge variety of interesting cocktails - some were quite ordinary but others were really delicious, interesting, and beautifully presented. The mocktails were definitely overpriced, which is really a shame, though.As for food, they brough around delicious samples of their pizza the first time I was there. The next time I was back I opted for the steak and cheese burger, which was delicious on a brioche bun. I thought the skinny fries didn't blow me away and could have been much better, but I really did like the burger.I was split between giving Sygn three stars or four, but what made me choose to be generous was that I really like the decor inside. It is really interesting and fun, including their great window decorations with bottles and their ornate ceiling. It's a fun place to go, and I enjoyed being back tonight.

Review Text :
My first impression was, "Cute cafe like Italian restaurant subtly inserted in a wall of the Venetian!"You might just walk by this little restaurant if you don't pay attention. Among the many shops and little stores within the Venetian, Trattoria Reggiano may only catch a glimpse of your attention because of their "outdoor patio." It's more just some tables set up nicely outside. Not bad, but I think they do that just to seat more people. Inside the restaurant seats just a few parties because there are about 10 small booths more or less. Their kitchen is tiny! Their ambiance definitely catches the intended theme of an "Italian street side cafe."It's a cute little place if you're craving some Italian food. Great garlic rolls, almost drenched in the oil and seasonings, some might complain. But I personally really liked it. We ordered the margarita pizza, and a pasta dish that I cannot recall the name of. But neither of the dishes were memorable and I really can't see myself ordering anything other than the basic spaghetti or Alfredo the next time I go there. Mainly, I'd be back for their garlic rolls. The food was okay, the service was okay (slightly rude), the ambiance quaint.The lasting impression? "I'll be back for some good ol' spaghetti and garlic rolls. But that's about it."felt like carb-ing up after a fun-filled memorial day weekend!This little restaurant was tucked in behind the lobster me stand. There were about 6-8 small tables outside, and 2-3 booths inside. The ambiance was interesting, it was somewhat an authentic italian feel but was off put by the venetian traffic walking by. The staff was attentive but seemed hastened. Nevertheless they were very sweet. Our noms:Complimentary Bread: Garlic knots - should have been a bit warmer. I'm a seasoning nazi and I think if they added more seasoning to the dough and added lots of garlic it would be delicious. Outside was very buttery. I took these guys home and baked them and added some garlic seasoning which made them bomb!Starter: Fried calamari appetizer - Large portion, lightly breaded and fresh tasting. Not bad but not the best i've tried either. Marinara that came with it was warm but strange. I had to add some more s + p + crushed red. I'm starting to think I just have a salty tongue! Entrees: I can't help but get pasta at every italian restaurant I come across. The man got the spaghetti + filet mignon meatballs. He thought it was OK, but then again we are spoiled by Enoteca Adriano in San Diego's spaghetti and meatballs. (Best i've ever had) For filet mignon meatballs I thought they would be moist and tender, they came out a bit dry. Spaghetti was nothing special. My entree: linguini w/ shrimp in white sauce. This usually comes with clams but I had a bad experience with eating clams far from a coast. I loooved this. It was light and refreshing. Linguini was perfectly al dente. I finished the entire thing and even mopped up the sauce with some garlic knots. A squeeze of lemon and fresh parmesan made it even better! (refer to picture posted) All in all, I would come back for the linguini. 3.5! Ohh the struggle of rounding up or down for a 3.5 star place. I'm gonna have to round down because of the boyf's lackluster spaghetti and meatballs. Sorry guys!Honorable mentions: Olive oil + balsalmic were absolutely delicious. They were obviously imported. Yum. Note: Pasta dishes ranged from $18-28. $18 being the most basic pastas, so I would say it is almost towards $$$.Happy eating! xoVegas is like the Great Glass Elevator from Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.  Push a button, any button, and *whoosh* you're off to some exotic destination. Is it the great pyramid of the Mojave or will it be a poolside oasis in this devastating heat? Well, my mama and I wished to be whisked away to the canals of Venice. *Whoosh* and off we went to Palazzo via the Monorail. Although only 1 stop away from MGM Grand where we stayed, we wanted to avoid the 92º heat at 8PM. Sure we still did some walking, but it was nice and cool amongst the marble laden hallways. After viewing pictures on Yelp of the foods served here, we we're insatiably curious to taste them for ourselves. Our tummies were VERY happy with this choice and so were our wallets! Trattoria Reggiano is a hole in the wall, tucked away within the Grand Canal Shoppes. Although it has a limited number of booths inside, the seating spills out into the hallway, creating a street cafe effect that seems both authentic and quaint. We sere seated immediately and we dove right into the menu. And the garlic balls! We both started with wine, ahhhhve cooooourse. To share, we split the meatballs.Oh, the MEATBALLSSSSS. So tender. So simple. So hot. So meaty. Smothered in the house "gravy" or "marinara" sauce, these went perfectly with the garlic balls served complimentary. The best things in life, come in ball form. They almost always come as a pair too. For our entrees, Mama went for the chicken marsala and I, the carbonara. Mine was so rich, creamy, and the right amount of salty bacon. Although I was extremely full from the meatballs and bread rolls, I don't know how I scarfed this amazing bowl of pasta down, but it was DAMN DELICIOUS. When all parts of a restaurant (ambiance, service, food, timing) come together in serendipitous unity, it's pure bliss. It's also the button I wanna press all the time in the Great Glass Elevator.Before a show at the Palazzo, I came here for dinner.  First impressions were not that good as there was no one at the podium.  A waiter came up to me, didn't say anything, and then turned and left.  Another waiter came over and showed me to a table on their "patio" along the Grand Canal Shops at the Venetian.  The tables are very close together in this area and as has been stated in other reviews, this is a high traffic area.  I tend to like people watching so I didn't mind the traffic.  It would have been nice if I didn't have to pretend not to hear the conversation of the two women at the table an arm's length from me.I was brought a menu and asked about drinks.  Soon a server came with three cheese and garlic rolls and some balsamic and EVOO which he left on the table.  My iced tea was brought and I ordered.  Asking the server what was the smallest appetizer, he suggested the caprese.  I ordered the caprese and the pesto gnocchi.  The caprese was OK.  The tomatoes were hot house tomatoes and not very flavorful and a bit hard.  The burrata was quite good.  The pouch of cheese pulled apart and I could place it on the tomato slices.  My server had done some freshly grated pepper on the caprese and that helped.  The best appetizer would have been simply the cheese with some bread and EVOO and let the tomatoes die on the hothouse floor.The pesto gnocchi was pretty standard.  There wasn't a strong pesto flavor, but the gnocchi were soft and tasty.After dinner, the server brought me a tray of dessert replicas and I chose the tiramisu.  It's done in a manner you don't see very often.  Instead of a cake like dessert, this version is mostly cream with lots of chocolate powder and some pieces of cake and chocolate near the bottom of the cream.  This was the best part of the meal.  The cream was perfect.  My only complaint is the dessert was served in a fluted goblet, but in the manner of drizzling syrups and sauces over dishes for looks, the plate on which the goblet rested was lined with caramel sauce and confectioners' sugar.  Why decorate a plate on which there's no food?  In fact, I got part of my hand on the caramel and I needed to find a washroom after I left to wash it all off.Service was good except for the start.  The place is OK but it's not a place I need to return to for Italian food.  Too many choices in this complex alone.Outstanding Italian food in the Venetian Mall! If you're lucky enough to be in Vegas and at the Venetian, don't skip this very popular spot in the Mall. The atmosphere on the patio has the urban street scene feel with all the mall customers walking by; lot's of hustle and bustle but it's not distracting like having a slot machine ringing in your ear. It was loud, boisterous... but nice! Very cool joint that I can't wait to visit again.WHEN YOU GO- Ask for Sergio and wait if you have to. The guy's worth it! DO NOT skip the Filet Mignon Meatballs. They're as good as they sound. Lobster Ravioli, Chicken Parm and lobster ravioli are winners as well.Very nice spot that is from now on in my regular Las Vegas resto rotation!This restaurant openly discriminates against people with children. If that appeals to you, great, but wait - there's more!  It has terrible service too.We walked up with our three kids when we saw there were at least six tables open.  We were told "there was a reservation" and that we could put our name on the list.  We did and went for a walk, for about 45 minutes.  We walked by again and guess what?  The same tables were open.  I asked again and guess what we were immediately seated, though the hostess seemed unwilling to do so.  What about that list? It was never mentioned.They put us in the back corner.  I saw the same open table in the front patio that had been and still was open when we first asked to be seated.  And when I asked, you guessed it, a "reservation."  The hostess had an extremely unwelcoming attitude. She said that they didn't have a kids' menu and we would have to order off of the adults menu.  Once we sat we were ignored for about 10 minutes.  It was clear that we weren't welcome, so we got up and left. When I walked by an hour later after eating somewhere else, that table was still open.   Let's get one more thing straight - this is no gourmet restaurant - it's in the middle of a mall adjacent to a food court!  There are kids and families everywhere.Yet another business that has no need for paying customers! Don't bother going there!Just no. I don't understand how their ratings can be so high. Walking in for a late dinner we were sat immediately. The waiter took our drink order,food order and tossed them at the table like we were unwanted there or he was having a bad day. I ordered a shrimp scampi and when it arrived it did not looked the way I thought it would. They should change the name to stuff shrimps instead. It seriously taste like something from Olive Garden or Red Lobsters. Overpriced,horrible service and mediocre food. I just don't get it.

Walking in here, you expect the music to come to a stop and everyone turns around and stares at you.  You know, one of those dive bars that everybody knows your name, because you're a regular.  But for me, a stranger coming in, I thought it would be awkward.  I'm happy to report, it wasn't at all!It almost seems like paradise!  A cozy little corner bar that has cheap food and a comfortable atmosphere.  We stopped in on a whim and it was a good decision.  It was 50 cent boneless wings and then at 8pm the beers went half off (Thursday night, just so you know:).  The news just kept getting better!  The selection of beers on tap is awesome.  What's even better is that the bartender was super nice and kept getting us samples of beers she thought we'd like.  I'm a total wimp when it comes to ordering spicy food, so I opted for the non spicy side of the menu (it's cool they have the menu listing from mild to hot wings).  I chose the garlic parm and Golden BBQ (honey BBQ).  They were good, a bit small, but not surprising for boneless wings.  I really liked the BBQ sauce, it was sweet and tangy and mixed well with the ranch to dip.The absolute only  thing I didn't like was that they allow smoking in here still.  I had just washed my hair that night too, ugh!  That smoke just sticks to you....yuck!I have a feeling this could become my new "spot."  Who knows, maybe I'll even become a regular...and not look disdainfully at the stranger walking through the door, because I'll know it's worth it!

Review Text :
You will see the same group of old people here every day. I am not exaggerating, they come here EVERY SINGLE DAY. Due to this, the restaurant manager allows them to have an express ticket to the front of the line, and they get their own seating area next to the food so that they don't have to walk far. The elderly regulars I mentioned completely hate when outsiders come into "their" restaurant. I've been here 3 times, and every single time, multiple regulars complained to me that if I(an outsider) didn't come to eat here today, there would be a shorter line and shorter wait time for them.  Last time I was here the group of regulars who were standing behind me at the cashier were loudly complaining about how it was a travesty that they had to stand in a line to pay now that "outsiders" had shown up. Ever since Rampart changed management, they have been sending out free buffet coupons to players club members. Therefore, this buffet has become extremely crowded. Back before they started sending out comps, only the same 20-30 regulars would show up for dinner every night. Now, there are 100s of new people showing up and it makes the regulars really angry. So, expect one of those angry old people to yell at you. The best thing about this place is that they have this really cool coffee-computer thing that instantly makes any kind of coffee you want. You don't have to wait 20 minutes for the server to bring it to you, it's all self-serveThis is Summerlin/NW Vegas so there will be a lot of bitter people fighting and arguing about stupid things. The last time I came I saw this guy whining because the guy in front of him got a bigger slice of prime rib. He kept shouting: "His was bigger than mine! That's not fair!".... It's an AYCE buffet, just ask for another slice. WTF is wrong with these people?

Review Text :
Exploring a new restaurant is always of interest.  The menu at Cafe Deia caught our attention, along with a few other specials they were offering.Starting off with their White Sangria ($20 pitcher), I found it to be a bit strong and not sweet enough.  I had to ask for some simple syrup so I could enjoy it morel.  Like Amy S. mentioned, they could really use some real fruit in there.  I like my sangria loaded with fruit and it's mostly lemon slices in there.A pretty large menu to choose from, but we decided to go with tapas all the way.* Serrano Ham and Manchego Cheese "Thinly sliced imported Serrano ham served with Manchego and a French baguette" ($9) - Highly recommended by our waiter, Chris.  Warm baguette arrived with a few slices of cheese and salty ham. Yes, it's good and very rustic.  Reminds me of the kind of food you grab for a picnic when you're overseas.  They give you more bread if you need it too!* Tuna Tartar "Diced ahi tuna mixed in wasabi, soy sauce and Asian chili paste served with avocado and green onions" ($8) - The avocado and tomatoes are served in a crispy shell with the tuna mixture and hard-boiled egg bits on the side.  Good, but needs some assembling if you want to get all the tastes in your mouth at once.* Shrimp Ceviche "Tiger shrimp cooked in lime and lemon juice, mixed with avocado, cucumber, red onions and chili pepper" ($9) - Generous on the shrimp and tasty!  It was good on its own and presented in a nice manner too.* Bacon Wrapped Figs "Fresh figs wrapped in bacon and pan seared" ($7) - My absoluter favorite dish of the evening.  A total flavor explosion in your mouth!  The balsamic vinegar sauce adds a nice acidity and sweetness, and is just delicious!  * Stuffed Mushrooms "Stuffed Chorizo mushrooms, and baked to perfection." ($4) - Yummy little buggers as well, along with the balsamic vinegar sauce drizzled on the bottom.  Good stuff! * Black Mediterranean Mussels in Garlic White Wine Sauce "Sauteed in garlic and white wine" ($9) - Came with bread which is needed to sop up all that wine and garlic sauce laying beneath the mussels.  Yum.* Mallorcan Soup "the only soup you can eat with a fork! pork, vegetables and bread slowly cooked in olive oil and natural juices" ($5) - It's 'interesting' if anything.  More stew-like, and not one of my favorites although the Husband enjoyed it.Dessert menus are delivered in a letter.* Fruit Beignet $3 - Pretty disappointing.  Nothing to rave about.  The batter had hints of all the other savory foods that it was fried with.* Chocolate Banana Crepe ($5) - Highly recommended by our waiter, especially since I wasn't impressed with the beignet.  The crepes were okay, a bit too thick for my liking.  Reminded me of pancakes, which I'm more of a waffle kind of girl.  Simple crepes, folded over, then slices of banana, chocolate sauce, and powdered sugar go on top.  I think the Spanish Creme Brulee ($7) or Chocolate Lave Cake ($7) would have fared better.We did try ordering:* Sausage Platter "Assorted imported Spanish sausages served with a French baguette" ($8) - Our waiter wasn't too fond of this and pushed the Serrano Ham and Manchego Cheese dish on us instead.* Albondigas "Ground beef meatballs served in a spicy tomato sauce" ($5) - Again, we wanted to order this, but was discouraged to do so.  Just as well from reading all the other reviews about this dish.Overall, service was good.  Chris was attentive as well as the other staff that helped along.  The food came out a bit too fast for the two of us, so we had to make room quickly at our table.  The chef came by at one point to check on our meal, which I definitely appreciated that personal touch.  (The Husband also noticed the chef helping out with front room duties too.)  We also saw salads made table side, which is totally unnecessary but a nice presentational effect.They have a lot of promise.  An outdoor eating area with firepit and happy hour specials can definitely pull in the crowds.  We went during their Mardi Gras specials.  The tapas we ordered are perfect for two to three sharing, maybe even four.  They also serve up salads, paellas, burgers, and pizza if you want something more for just yourself too. (Pics posted!)

Restaurant name  Grimaldi's Coal Brick-Oven Pizza
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
We had a taste for some good New York style pizza and heard a Grimaldi's opened recently out east of us at the furthest reaches of the realm...San Tan Village in Gilbert.  I knew from Yelp reviews of other Grimaldi's that we needed to check them out for ourselves as they are reputed to be the real deal.We started with a small mediterranean salad ($7) and a Leinenkugel Sunset Wheat.  I was pleasantly surprised at the size of the small salad.  It was more than enough for the 3 of us to share.  It had fresh, crisp greens and a good amount of yummy feta, olives, red onion slices and ripe tomatoes.  The sunset wheat ale was tasty but wouldn't be my first choice.  For my taste it was too fruity with a hint of clover or something.And then the pizza arrived.  Magnifico!  A thin yet supportive and crunchy crust with a nice tomato sauce and delicious slices of mozzarella!  We each devoured 2 slices, saving room for dessert.  For dessert we shared a cannoli.  We asked before ordering the cannoli if it was made with custard or was it made the right way.  The proper response?  "The right way."  Yummy and rich enough that you have to share.The service from our server Kyle was outstanding and one of the managers, Darren also made sure we were receiving excellent treatment.  All in all, an excellent experience and we'll be back.They take reservations for parties of 5 or more if you call before 4.I like this location better than the one in Old Town, which is the only other location I've been to. It's a pretty small restaurant, but they also have a small private room in the back for gatherings. The ingredients all taste fresh and if you sit at a high top in the bar area you can watch them make the pizza. I love watching the prep! We  actually forgot our leftovers after our last visit and one of the waiters came out to give them to us. So nice!If you're lucky you may find parallel parking spot right out front, but there's also more parking in a big lot just to the west of the restaurant. And the best part is you can walk off your meal by strolling around the shops.If you have read my other reviews, you know that I love Grimaldis and think its the best pizza anywhere outside of Totonnos in Brooklyn.  This Grimaldis was on par with all the others.  FLAT OUT AWESOME!We got 2 pizzas.  A white with pepperoni on it and a regular one with meatballs and roasted red peppers.  Both pizzas were awesome.  I did notice the red sauce here was a little tiny bit more bland than other Grimaldis,  but it didn't hurt the pizza at all.  They slice meatballs really thin and pile them on.  The roasted red peppers are out of this world.  The white pizza has so much flavor with all the olive oil, garlic and cheese they put on.  Fantastic pizzas!Our waiter was friendly and I give mad props to one of the bus boys that works there.  I forgot my hat and he came running out of the restaurant to give it to me.  Awesome service and awesome pizza=an easy 5 stars!I had not been to a Grimaldi's in about five years prior to this visit. I knew that it was a rather pricey pizza restaurant but I was craving pizza and we were at San Tan Mall so I figured I would give it another try. I was with my sister and she did have her dog with her so we asked one of the manager's if we could sit outside on the patio with the dog. At first she said no but then she told us if we could find a seat near the edge of the railing and tie him up on the outside of the rail, we could eat on the patio. We did end up finding a perfect spot where we were able to tie him up and have him right next to us while sitting on the patio. It was really nice of her to let us do that and accommodate our needs with the dog. Good start.We were pretty hungry last night and we both really wanted a starter of some kind, garlic bread, bruschetta, something like that... To our surprise Grimaldi's carries no form of appetizers other than salads. Salads are great and all but we just couldn't believe that they had no other kind of appetizer. When we asked our waitress if they had any sort of bread she  seemed almost irritated that we even asked. We decided that we would just end up ordering a starter caesar salad because really this was one of our only choices. We also ordered a large   pepperoni, onion and jalapeno pizza. The salad was okay. The caesar dressing was a little to bitter for me, a little too much vinegar for my tastes.The pizza here for me is just okay. Some people really love Grimaldi's and to each their own, but it is just not the pizza of choice for me. The crust was a little over done which because of the coal brick oven gave it a slight burned taste. I did like the fresh mozzarella and that was probably the best part of the pizza but I found myself eating around other parts of the pizza just to get to the bits of cheese. I am just not a fan of Grimaldi's pizza and I won't find myself coming back here to pay $22 for a pizza I don't like. The service was pretty good. Our waitress was very attentive. I did get a slight sense of arrogance from her but overall she kept our drinks refilled and she did answer our questions even if she was a little snooty about it. I did give a three star because even though this is not the pizza for me, it is not bad pizza, just not my taste.

This is back to beloved diner status in my mind, based on a recent visit where I got to experience the full on Miss Jean Talon, not just the glimpse you get from delivery. Big booths, cheap glasses of beer, awesome friendly madame service, all day basic yummy breakfast so you can eat yer eggs in the afternoon while your friends eat a sub and a delicious personal sized pizza. I would totally go back here to eat diner food and drink all day, and if this sounds like joy to you too we should probably be friends.

Restaurant name  Quartier-Perse
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
Quartier Perse is a well established and deservedly popular restaurant that does amazing things to rice and kabobs.This will come as a shock to some, but Persian rice is the penultimate way of preparing rice. It's fluffy and chewy and delicious in a way that no other culture has managed to surpass. To start, we chose a few bowls of Zeytoon Parvardeh, an olive dish with pomegranate paste, walnuts, garlic and herbs. These were eye-crossingly yummy.As a meat aficionado, you should probably order the Soltani #2 combo - a beautiful plate upon which there is a mountain of buttered rice and two kabobs. One, the "Barg", is a beef filet marinated to perfection and cooked to your preference. The other, the "Koubideh" is a minced beef that also is mouth-wateringly delicious. You can shake a little of the powdered Sumac spice on your meat and rice for an added touch of authenticity.Being the Designated Driver I treated myself to a glass of Doogh - a drink that my Iranian friend assured me went well with the cuisine. He was right. Doogh is a savory yogurt based drink that was minty and salty and went perfectly with the meal. He said that Doogh is an acquired taste but really, it took me only two sips to appreciate the beverage and to welcome it into my inventory of "Exotic Things That I Tried That I Thought I Might Not Like But Liked Anyway". My table-mates had the wine that we brought with us. (Quartier Perse is also BYOB in addition to having a Wine and Beer license)What I couldn't eat was loaded into a Styrofoam container and the inevitable discussion with the Missus was had. "Shall we feed the leftovers to the kittens or not?" I voted for my stomach, not theirs and happily savoured my leftover Koubideh and rice the next day.

Review Text :
This review is for breakfast at Prado...Read on if you're interested in an impressive place for your morning meal!(I hear that lunch and dinner can be inconsistent, but I have a new favorite breakfast place in town thanks to the meal I shared with my HUSBAND on Monday morning at Prado.While I walked by Prado, the Montelucia's main restaurant, several times throughout our wedding weekend, I'd never been in for breakfast or lunch.  So, after a fabulous yoga class at Joya spa on Monday, my HUSBAND (yes, I love saying that) met me for breakfast at Prado.There is patio seating but we sat indoors.  Either way, it's beautiful with a fantastic Spanish decor and ambiance.I went with the egg white omelette, which comes with peppers, spinach, and mushrooms and a side of your choice of toast.  Multi-grain was my choice.  Jared ordered the burrito, which includes scrambled eggs, merguez sausage, onions, potatoes, and pico de gallo.  Each of these items are priced at $10.My omelette was delicious!  It came well done just as I requested and they did not skimp on the veggies.  It was served with a delicious salsa and it was so big I couldn't finish it.  I may just have to return with a friend and order one omelette to share.  I didn't want to stop eating although I was getting full, but Jared was sick of waiting on me.  So, he left me eating and went to go take care of some "business" if you know what I mean.Luckily, our server, Dominic, was super sweet.  He came and chatted with me and kept my water and coffee full.  And he didn't make me feel like an idiot when I asked for sweet 'n low and it was there just hiding in the sweetener box right in front of me.  He also dropped off a special quote of the day with my bill.  My quote reads "Time has a wonderful way of showing us what really matters." (Margaret Peters).  So maybe the quote isn't necessarily UFC as it relates to my review, but if you're up for sharing a well done, fluffy egg white omelette with me for breakfast some time, let me know... we can meet at Prado at the Montelucia!After checking into our lovely suite at the Montelucia my hubby said he was in the mood for some chips, guac and a margarita. I think he had mistaken Scottsdale for Mexico and unfortunately the restaurant at The Montelucia (Prado) had none of the above. Instead we enjoyed a glass of wine (Riesling for me), a bowl of gazpacho and shared the snapper ceviche.  Service was a bit on the slow side, but the tasty food made up for it...We ended up back at Prado the next morning for breakfast- we were quite starving after hiking Camelback (or part of Camelback).  I was a bit disappointed with their breakfast menu. They had very few things to choose from besides the $25 breakfast buffet. I wasn't in a buffet kind of mood, but it didn't seem like we had a choice. However, I seemed to get the most out of my $25 after stuffing my face with an omlette, mini breakfast burrito, fruit, yogurt parfait, etc.  Our waiter did a bit of a disappearing act, but fortunately we didn't need him much for the buffet.They do have some good food, but they could use some more options...and better service.

(with apologies to Brian S for the blatant theft of "Pi Stars":-)I don't know...this is a hot dog joint and there are rules...and Famous Uncle Al (not his real name, BTW) breaks nearly all of the rules!Lets take a look at the Rules of Hot Dog Joints, shall we:) - Crappy linoleum floors and counters, accompanied by a "kitchen" in severe need of a degreasing - Not available at FUA:)I swear, I have never seen a cleaner, brighter hot dog joint in my life...you could eat off the floor (or really, pretty much any horizontal surface) in here...the place is just kept in pristine condition:) - A cook who's seen better days and a little bit of attitude from the "help" - Also, sadly, unavailable at FUA:)The little family that owns and operates this franchise greeted me at the door, asked me to sit at one of their lovely clean tables, anywhere I wanted to sit and then waited on me at that table...what a novel concept...service with a smile:) - Crappy, wobbly little tables and a dingy, torn wallpaper motif (with the optional, but ever so popular, "No Pest Strip" dangling from the ceiling)? - Nothing remotely like that going on here:)FUA is open and bright, airy and nicely decorated...they have a nice big LCD TV set on ESPN, or the news or something like that...so I don't have to watch "Lost" reruns on my phone while lunching solo:) - Hot Dogs and buns from the "what we didn't sell last week" bin, served for your pleasure from a grease and water bath - Again, just not how they do things at FUA:)These dogs are alright...certainly on a par with any other decent hot dog joint and better than most:)They serve their variety of dogs in a variety of ways...if you don't see it on the menu as one of their standards, just ask:)...want a brat with mustard, celery salt, relish, red onion sauce and shredded (not melted) cheese?...they are only too happy to accommodate (and for not a lot of cash, either:) - The last rule they break is a doozy, though...hot dog joints are always little and underfunded...a hand to mouth existence for all but a fortunate few - not FUA...a public company traded under the symbol "FDOG.OB"...fdog?...really?...OK:)2 dogs, w/shredded cheese, and a large beverage set me back a cool $9.10 today...for a couple of very good dogs...hey, my physical was arduous...I needed the boost at lunch:)I didn't even have to stand in line for it:)

Dennis, my partner and I, call this "The Pig Restaurant" as they have so many little ceramic pigs that decorate the dining room. I love this tiny restaurant in the heart of the gay village!Open 24 hrs, this French Quebec cafe has everything from soups, sandwiches, poutine, great coffee, braised beef and carrots, hamburger steak, homemade desserts, yummy breakfasts, and so much more. I love it that I can have all choices at any time. Prices are cheap, cheap, cheap!

Review Text :
I had the wonderful opportunity to eat @ Grady's last Friday. The building is in a strip mall just south of Cactus on 19th Ave. Once you enter you see a clean, crisp, and inviting place. There are only enough seats for 10 or so but it is worth eating in the car if you have to. Carolyn and "Grady" are one of the nicest couples you have ever met. Please be sure to critique the food as they are still trying to figure out what we like in N. Phx. I had the pulled pork sandwich with homemade potato salad and a coke. The pork was cooked and smoked to perfection and not a pile of fat. The sauce is a homemade, hot, mild or super hot, all three were good. I used a mix of the mild (Tenn. style) and the hot (more of a Carolina style?) together to make a great mix. The salad was not as good as I hoped and they mentioned making it a little different next time. Did I mention the sauce is for sale? The Banana Pudding was EXCELLENT. Please stop by and talk with the owners, give them your honest opinion and lets keep a great BBQ in N. Phx.Grady and Carol were super friendly creating a downright homestyle, accomodating atmosphere.Just like the food.My brother and I split and shared the pulled pork and the bbq brisket sandwiches.  Both were delicious, but my personal taste preferred the smoky pork.  There are other choices written on the wall, with pictures that make it all look just as good as what I sampled.There are three choices of sauce - Mild, Hot, and Super Hot (which really is!)I thought Hot was near perfect, but did ask for a sample side of Super Hot, which was nice in small amounts, and great mixed with kethcup for the salty and very hot fries.There are cold sides like macaroni and potato salads, etc, and the peach cobbler looked good, but we didn't have it today.Yelpers should be very impressed that once he saw Daren, Grady got all excited about having him try his new variation on the potato salad, since he'd read Daren's Yelp saying that the sides may be a little lacking, and he knew just what was missing and had spiced the dish right up.  Daren confirmed that this batch was quite good and that the things he thought weren't right last time were good now.Grady was very pleased with himself, and Daren enjoyed the taste, but ironically it was the last of the batch and he had to have fries instead!The storefront is in a strip mall that, although a little run down, is nestled nearby a portion of Phoenix Mountain Preserve which beautifies the background.  2 tables and about 5 chairs fill the sit-down portion of the lobby, but with this weather coming right now it shoud be on your list of picnic and reunion weekend get togethers for pickup of catering style takeout.Plus I see a very cramped episode of Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives in their future.See you next time Grady and Carol!!PS: I can't think of any specific thing that makes this only 4 stars instead of 5 except that I just know that it will give me an opportunity (excuse) to try more things right away and bump it up to a 5 soon!Third visit, and she calls me by name upon walking in the door!I made it by for dinner Saturday after trying several times on a Sunday (they get a day off, too y'know)Delicious as usual.  I notice on the menu boards that they are now offering quite a selection.Besides BBQ brisket, pork, chicken, 1/4 or half chicken, wings, ribs, and all the fixin's, they now also offer a bunch of seafood options like fried catfish, etc.I got a tshirt: "I [heart] Grady's BBQ Sauce"Oh, and it's so clean in their kitchen, I'd be willing to eat off of the floor near the baseboard behind the prep table.No kidding, I've seen it.  Aside from that the kitchen was intoxicating me with a smorgas~copia of aromas.  Daren suggested setting up a Special Chef's Table in the narrow hallway, which I heartily agreed with.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4a9JpaxYER0I'll be sad that I can't stop in to my local neighborhood storefront for the best BBQ in phoenix, but I'll get over that since I can go down to the Downtown Farmer's Market every weekend for a fix.I'm downright inconsolable about not being able to see as much of my two friends, Grady and Carolyn.8,^ (Viva Grady's     http://www.yelp.com/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%.

hate having to do this but there has been a lot of changes at Murphy's in the last year, none of which I can report as being good. This place used to be consistently great with service and food but I'm sad to say it's not anymore. Began earlier this summer when the food started being hit or miss. Some days it was the stellar food we all came in to have at lunch and other days... not so good. To the point that the last three times were bad and the large group of us haven't gone back and probably won't. The food thing came down to if a certain chef was working - if he was there, good; if not, bad. Started asking the waitresses and figured out the trend. Fast forward to today and that chef has left and no longer works there. Which leads me to understand why the last 3 times in a row the food has been subpar. Like what makes a tomato hard? wasn't green or unripe but hard like... tough to cut hard. wtf? I don't know enough to know this is a reason the food has got worse but typically if you're looking to franchise you get different food vendors that can deliver the same type of food to your locations all across the country. So think frozen foods instead of more fresh stuff etc. I mean it makes sense.Also when you have a trained Chef quit whom made great food, and tailored to groups that wanted more expensive off the menu lunches and catered for local businesses & events... something's up. I can only assume it was the quality in food and the new direction... ... meaning... I also found out (chandler news and biz journal) that Murphy's is wanting to franchising and changing their name to Irish Republic and some of what's going on inside. Girls with slightly different garb... kilt's and knee-high's. etc. Not so much breastaraunt-ish but similar. Trademark Info: http://www.trademarkia.com/irish-republic-public-house-85274024.htmlService... much like the food the service has gone down in quality. There never seems to be enough girls during what used to be the lunch rushes and an hour lunch quickly turns into 1:30 lunches waiting on fill-ups and food and the check. It's not horrible service, girls are nice and friendly, just slow. In summary:We haven't returned in at least 4 weeks and it's just not an option when thinking of places to eat downtown Chandler anymore. From 5 to a 2 (meh i've experienced better).I miss what Murphy's was - we all do.

Review Text :
This is my favourite restaurant in Montreal: hands down, no contest, I want to marry it. I brought 3 restaurant-savvy New Yorkers with me for this food journey and they were blown away with how much Joe Beef rocks.It was pouring buckets outside and the restaurant was warm, cozy and totally hopping when we arrived for our 7pm reservation. After standing there and trying to pick from all of the choices on the chalkboard, I finally hung my head and begged the server for her help. She laughed and then started listing her favourites. We ordered them all, everything from the duck, to the terrine to 3 types of fish. Every bite was incredible, tasty and knee-weakening delicious. The wine my dinner partner picked was perfect with all of our dishes, so good, that we ordered a second bottle.The ambiance of this place is just plain awesome and I adore the buffalo in the washroom, he just makes me happy! This place is food porn at its best and I don't want help for my addiction.I'm not a frequent reviewer of things.  I am, however, a frequent reader of reviews and I hope that these few paragraphs will save you from making a grave financial and culinary mistake. My girlfriend and I first discovered Joe Beef five years ago.   We were looking in antique shops along Notre Dame when we stumbled upon this tightly packed, hole in the wall restaurant.  The menu was on a chalkboard, the waiters were kind and casual and the food was beyond divine.  We ordered about 24 fresh, sweet, New Brunswick Oysters, My girlfriend ordered the Lobster Spaghetti, I got the 49 dollar cut of steak with a slab of Roquefort Blue cheese.  It was delicious, expensive and worth it.  The next year, it was just as good, the following, a little less so, and the same decline the subsequent year.  We skipped last year, because the owners were busy opening their new restaurant Liverpool House.We both wanted to bring my parents to Joe Beef this year, especially because we missed out the year before.  What a mistake. From the moment we arrived, I knew that Joe Beef had radically declined in the last two years.   Joe Beef had died, and his corpse was sitting in a barely air-conditioned room with new tables and terrible food. It was empty at 6:30pm, our appointed reservation time; we were lead from a cool room into a hot back room.  My mother complained about the heat, she is a fit woman whose age I will not betray in this review, but suffice to say, she's earned the right to not sit in 85-degree heat while dropping 50 bucks on entrées.We asked to be moved to a cooler area, they kindly obliged.  That was the last positive event of the night.Here are the lowlights:The waiter walked away from us in the middle of explaining the menu, he returned and hurried us to order, even though we hadn't fully understood the dishes available. After being rushed to order, we waited a total of 1 hour and 10 minutes for appetizers, and another 1 hour and 30 minutes for entrees.My appetizer was supposed to be play on a Mac and cheese terrine with a duck egg on it.  It looked and tasted like the Chef took spam and mixed Kraft Mac & Cheese into it, fried it and put a chicken egg on top.  I know duck egg flavor and it wasn't a duck egg.My mom's cold soup was luke warm.  The waiter fixed this, not by making a new soup, but by trying to put ice cubes in it and re-serving it.  This is a 20 dollar appetizer!My steak with Gorgonzola was dry, grey and rubbery.This was all happening as the waiter kept pretending that nothing was wrong, furiously refilling our waters like we were at a hot dog eating contest, and it's now 85 degrees in the once cool main room.Finally, everything was SALTY, SALTY SALTY.The waiter dropped the bill, NEARLY $400.00 with no discounts for the wait or bad service, plus an extraneous alcoholic beverage that nobody ordered. He apologized at the very end, once he was paid.  We left, united in our dismay at what had happened and knowing that we would never go again. My girlfriend and I knew that we just attended the wake of Joe Beef.  We had pits in our stomachs.Or maybe that was just their heinous Eel Nuggets eating at our stomach linings.Review #500!!Joe Beef was the best restaurant I went to in Montreal, and that's saying quite a bit. I was able to walk-in on one of the more popular restaurants in the city (called for reservations and weren't taking any for a week!). Joe Beef is a small place split off into two different dining areas, with one being the main and the other being a lounge of sorts with the bar. The menu is a chalkboard that hangs high against the wall and consists entirely of French. Within the walls of this tiny little establishment, lay a place that had the intimate feel you look for when you're with your significant other, with food that would put you into a coma. We started the night with eel nuggets....yeah...eel nuggets. There were a lot of starters that looked very good including the foie gras double down, but eel nuggets had to be ordered because I had no idea what that would even taste like. As soon as she saw it on the menu, the gf knew she was getting the Lobster Spaghetti. Likewise, as soon as I saw Duck on the menu, I was getting that.The Eel nuggets are exactly what they sound like. The nuggets were real crunchy as I think they were breaded with cornflakes. The eel filling itself was a mix of eel and potato, so it had a pasty kind of texture. The eel and potato mixture was overly salty while the breading added no real flavor. There was a good hint of smokiness to go along with the app, but I didn't really enjoy it. In fact, it just tasted odd in a bad sort of way. Luckily, the entrees were tremendous. My entree was the Duck with Montreal Smoked Meat. The name itself was enough to ensure that I ordered it. The Duck breast was parted into thick cuts of meat that made it so satisfying and savory. The dish came garnished with small bits of smoked meat and oddly enough, pickles. Surprisingly, the pickles with the duck worked for me. The sauce was savory as well, and the smoked meat did not serve to overpower the duck but add to the dish as a whole. Lobster Spaghetti is simply that. Giant chunks of lobster (shell-on) were tossed with spaghetti in a buttery cream sauce. The lobster meat was very tender and the spaghetti soaked in all that lobster-y brininess. The butter and cream sauce lends itself to being quite heavy, but the gf claims it was one of her favorite dishes ever.If the food wasn't good enough, the service was excellent. Our server Andrew was always around and making sure we were well taken care of despite how busy the place was slowly getting. He was friendly, funny, and seemed like one of the guys who just happened to bring you food. The place, despite it's fame and reputation, doesn't exude a feeling of pretention at all. I fully enjoyed the entire experience and thus truly earned my 5 star rating. Best restaurant in Montreal. Period.No words will do justice to the food here.I've been meaning to come to Joe Beef for a while now, I mean I'm a native Montrealer and just never got the chance while droves of tourists, Anthony Bourdain followers and every chef on earth has been coming here for years.So with last minutes changes, somehow  I finally came last week for a 6pm seating.My dinner companion friend and I were not disappointed. I've seen the photos, I know the call, I knew even before I sat down what I was going to have. For lovers of seafood, the East Coast oysters here are a "must". Briny, juicy and plump and shelled right upon ordering, a quirt of lemon juice is all you need to happily slurp these beauties down.Which then brings me to the Bloody Ceasar. Served in a Mason jar, a stalk of celery, a pickle and an olive dunked within along with a giant shrimp and a single oyster in the half-shell sitting across the mouth of the jar, with spiced chilli salt rimmed around the glass, *THIS* should be the new normal of how all Bloody Caesars should be served the world over, in my humble opinion.I knew I wanted dessert so I knew I couldn't go overboard on everything so to pace myself, I deliberately got a light starter, in this case the watercress soup. If you like things which taste green-ey then you'll love this soup. If on the other hand, green smoothies are not your thing, don't get this. The garlic bread slices which it came with were perfect. I got the spaghetti lobster, a whole flippin lobster, claws, tails and legs, cooked, cracked open, sauteed in some God-knows-what-rich-fatty buttery with parsley concoction along with spaghetti. I was brought up to clean my plate off  and while I was inching closer and closer to the explosion mark, I figured to be good, at least I could polish off the lobster meat, which I did. It turns out I should not have felt so bad. They do doggie bags here, so that rich spaghetti I left on my plate, I was able to take home with me to nosh on the next day.My friend had I think a Cornish game hen, deep breaded with panko, sitting in another ungodly rich sauce. He finished of his bird and had to take the sauce home. I tried a bite and it was also delicious. We also spied over at the table next to us. The couple had ordered probably the most amazing cuts of steak I've seen in a long while, large enough to probably feed a village in Bangladesh . They too were relieved to learn they could take it home as well.For dessert I had the infamous Gateau Marjolaine. Good thing it was a thin slice because this was one of the richest cakes I've had in a while. Because it was my birthday, I got a sparkly candle too! Service was outstanding. Our waitress explained all the dishes to  us and the wine lists as well. After every course, our tables were wiped down, and I even saw Fred and Dave lurking in the back .This is a bucket list restaurant. If you live in Montreal, you have to come here at some point. No excuses.It's just so so. Not worth the money. Seafood platter was fresh. Everything else was either too bland or too salty. Had cod as main dish, no flavour at all. So bland.

Review Text :
Hands down, my favorite pizza ever!  I can no longer imagine anything better than Lorenzo's White pizza.  This super simple pie of ricotta, garlic, and mozzarella won me over at first bite, actually at first sight once I saw the size of it.  I owe a HUGE thank you to my husband that could not us.  Had he showed up, he would have insisted on your standard red sauce pepperoni pizza, although I have a sneaking suspicion Lorenzo can conjure up a pretty good pepperoni pie, too.  Even mister red sauce had to admit the leftovers were pretty darn tasty.  And the garlic knots?  Pure doughy deliciousness.  And Shannon M, you displayed the ultimate act of friendship prior to abandoning Arizona, by hooking me up with Lorenzo.  I might need to buy your house just so I can live closer to him!

Review Text :
I'm a foodie, and have been for the last 30 years or so, when I first became an adult, and able to pay for my own dinner.Europea is probably among the top 3 places I've ever eaten. I judge a restaurant by food (includes taste, freshness, creativity with ingredients and presentation), service and ambience. I came here during lunch with my wife, and knew it had good ratings on trip advisor, but wanted to see for myself. This restaurant is booked up about 10 days in advance, so I was able to get a lunch reservation because of a cancellation. My wife and I got there 20 minutes early, they checked my reservation and escorted us to a table right away. The service was phenomenal. We had the Maitre'D and 2 servers waiting on us. They came out with Maple cured beef jerky and goat cheese lollipops, with truffle popcorn as a welcome appetizer. It was great! We ordered a combination of things... the Calamari was sliced to resemble noodles and was so tender and tasty. I got the mushroom and chestnut soup... amazing! We both got the scallops with root vegetables as the entree; the bitterness of the root vegetables perfectly balanced out the sweetness of the scallops. At the end for dessert, I got the chocolate and pistachio truffle and my wife got the Creme Brûlée... both were done wonderfully.The combination of the culinary surprises, and the wonderful flavors in those dishes, married with the service gives this place 5 stars in my book. A must visit. We probably indulged too much, and had several cocktails, which set the bill high, but if we had one glass of wine a piece, the price would have been about $100... which is about what we spend in NYC for a meal that's not equal at all.An absolute gem of a find, and if you have the opportunity to go there, you will not be let down!

Restaurant name  Malhi Sweets Indian Cuisine

Review Text :
Malhi Sweets is a few blocks from the north west corner of Jarry Park, seats approx 20 on super clean simple wooden tables and chairs by wide windows. It's not fancy: some Indian art and TV's broadcasting hot Bollywood music videos at a pretty mellow decibel, lots of framed clippings of great reviews and celebrity guests. There's an attentive staff and diverse clientele and everyone is smiling. Today we started with the Aloo Tikki and Malhi Special rolls, both crispy but light and we loaded them with lots of yummy, spicy sauces. I had Aloo ghobi (crazy delicious cauliflower and potatoes) Shahi Paneer (amazing soft homemade cheese in a creamy, tomatoey, Indian spicy sauce) the man had the Goat Curry and declared it his new favourite food. We shared nan - thin, soft, hot, lightly buttery - perfect. We drank frothy sweet lassi's and an Indian beer called Taj Mahal on tap - light refreshing lager that goes great with curry, and they have some other local and Indian mircobrews I'd go back to try. When we could eat no longer we loaded up the to-go tray's, paid our 46$ bill (nice!) and walked off into the sunset.Cet endroit n'a pas du tout été ce à quoi je m'attendais. Avec tous les avis 5 étoiles, je m'attendais à quelque chose de beaucoup plus chic. Le décor ressemble plutôt a celui d'un resto de quartier qui sert des hamburgers donc c'est plutôt pour la bouffe que cet endroit se mérite tant d'étoiles. Et je ne peux m'empêcher que de leur donner une note parfaite tellement les plats sont savoureux. Étant avec une amie végétarienne je n'ai pas goûté à ce que je considère comme étant les classiques avec lesquels je compare les autres restos indiens. Par contre les plats qu'on a partagé étaient tellement délicieux qu'on a léché nos plats jusqu'à ce qu'il ne reste plus une seule goûte de cari à l'aide de nos pain naans géants qui fondent dans nos bouches tellement ils sont frais. On a partagé des samosas,  une autre entrée dont j'ignore le nom, trois currys différents er du riz. On était tellement pleines et en plus il en restait pour un lunch pour deux personnes. Et tout ça pour aussi peu que 35$ taxes et tip inclus.Je suis super contente d'avoir découvert un des meilleurs restos indien de la ville mais je suis triste en même temps parce qu'il est pas mal loin de chez nous. Ça me donnera une excuse de plus pour aller visiter mes amis qui se retrouvent dans ce coin de la ville.

Restaurant name  District American Kitchen and Wine Bar

Review Text :
So it may be a hotel restaurant, in a convention hotel, downtown... but this place is for real. The atmosphere is decidedly W, or painfully Scottsdale. It's got the color scheme of Sushi Roku, the vibe of a big city restaurant, and food for gods. It is connected through the lobby of the hotel, but also has it's own entrance, something the other hotel restaurants in the area cannot say. District is also privately owned, so you won't fall victim to any Sheraton miscues in the restaurant here, just thier own which I have to say there aren't many so far. The restaurant is dark and mysterious in the lounge area, and completely open in the dining room, which makes for a great social atmosphere all around. They also feature local artists with the wall art changing monthly, and it's for sale too! I'm glad someone had the foresight to do that, rather than buy some mass produced crap from Malaisa. There is a private boardroom style dining room in the back, with two large semi private dining rooms, and another large dining table overlooking the restaurant, so large parties would be great in this space. I'm thinking the large table in the dining room is the best as you are almost on a king's throne above everyone.The food follows the same cues as the atmosphere. It's familiar, but fun and exciting... they call it "American Comfort" and thats exactly what it is. The menu features Shrimp Po' Boy Sliders, Mussels which come in a ginormous bowl with an incredible sauce, Short Rib w/chipotle grits, salmon, steak, and other familiar dishes with a little local taste. Our table enjoyed everything including the Organic Berkshire Pork with Memphis BBQ sauce, Mac & Cheese, and Applesauce. Also on the table were the Mussels, and the Caesar Salad which might have been the only dissapointment. I ordered the Short Rib, and we all agreed it was one of the best we had ever tasted. They even made Grits delicous. It's obvious that quality has been taken into account as all of the vegetables and meats are locally produced and purchased from small farms. Queen Creek, The Farm at South Mountain, and Schreiner's are just some names that come to mind. The chef was kind enough to come out and introduce himself about mid-meal and I asked him where he came from, the answer pretty much explained the entire evening to me. He is the former Executive Chef of the late Mary Elaine's, Mr. Belosic, and he explained he was just having fun doing something people would be familiar with. There was a dish on the menu that literally everyone would be familiar with, from Fried Chicken or Cod, to a Ribeye. The drink list is pretty standard on the wine side, but the beer list is much more unique, featuring almost solely microbrews from New Belgium, Oak Creek, and Widmer. There is even an organic beer on the list. Though I wasn't drinking last night, I thought $3.75 was enticing enough for a microbrew that I'd go back another day to enjoy.Perhaps the highlight of the night for me was when the bill came, not because I wanted to pay, but because like other restaurants they bring a little something with the tab. Most places do the apropos mints, chocolates, etc. Not District, nope, this place brings you a big cotton candy on a stick, a la the state fair from when I was a kid. How cool is that? The bill came out to about $60 w/o drinks for 3 people, which honestly we felt was very fair, almost as though it were an underpriced Mary Elaine's meal. My only, and I mean ONLY gripe with the restaurant is more with the narrow visioned architects who designed the space. The patio has about a 3.5' cement wall, which is just high enough to make the diner feel disconnected from the street. It would have been really nice to do something glass, or steel, to engage the street and encourage people watching... plus it would feel much less confined, but oh well. I'll go back again, and probably again after that, especially now that I've learned they feature live music Thursday through Saturday. Keep on Keepin' on District, and heres to hoping you open the floodgates of trendy, chic, urban hotspots in Downtown Phoenix.District, it's the restaurant & bar in the newly opened Sheraton in downtown.  What can you say about being at a place on opening really.  It's shiny, the leather is fresh, the decor is new, and so are the staff.  Being the first official day open, there was staff everywhere, but that was taken advantage of quickly.  They all were eager to talk, only thing is most of them have not sampled the full line-up of wares.  I looked for suggestions before ordering, but could not receive any.  By no means did this stop me from trying items though.  The main theme of food and beverages is local, or least from the United States (or territories).  The first thing noticed was the beer on tap, all microbrews, and half of them from Arizona breweries.  The wine list was decent, but 95% of them hailing from California.  Liquor selections were the same, all U.S. made, meaning no tequila.  They were still waiting for half of their bottles to arrive, as the shelves did not match the menu yet.  I suppose items like Tito's Vodka from Texas is not the easiest item to have on hand upon opening.  Although I was promised it would arrive soon.  The menu was not extensive and nothing screamed try me, but a few descriptors did engage my eyes, such as 'angry onions'.  Still, nothing outrageous or unheard of.  Being with a baseball-minded friend, we did sit at the bar (the restaurant being empty) just to have something to watch and decided to sample from several apps.  Local Jerky, as listed, was locally produced jerky ranging from Elk to Buffalo to Turkey.  It came out served on a wooden plank in a small canning jar.  Accompanying it were stone ground mustard, sea salt, and pickled garlic, all in small white angled bowls.  Next item was chips and dips, house-made potato chips in a large bowl on a wooden plank as well.  They came tandem with some very chunky onion dip and boat dip.  The jerky was tasty, with several different styles to gnaw on, it made for a unique gnoshing experience.  The chips were tasty, but about the same as if you made them yourself at home.  Later in the evening we still needed more sampling and ordered up some sweet potato 'tots'.  They were served with ranch on the side and arrived again on the wooden plank.  The tots appeared to have been steamed in Indian tradition.  They were mushy, but in the good sense, and full of flavor.  Overall the food was decent.  The building itself is gorgeous.  The staff needs time to become knowledgeable.  Next time, I may sit and have a full meal.What can I say, except I LOVE District! The street-side dining is great, especially right now when the weather is amazing. The theme American Kitchen & Wine bar runs deep and you will find wonderful, delicious comfort food, carefully crafted by Chef Nathan. My personal favorites are the golden calamari, AZ Sweet Shrimp Po' Boy sliders & the scallops, seared to perfection. Wash it all down with a $3.75 (seriously) microbrew & don't forget to save room for dessert. The pumpkin whoopie pies served with a mini bourbon malt shake will make you greedy & not want to share, but you will because you get 3. They also have some of the most attentive & friendly servers I've ever encountered.Don't worry about parking, District validates for up to 3 hours in the garage. Stop by the Sheraton & give the newest addition to downtown dining a try, you won't regret it!I don't Love District. It's something that I meditated on all day before sitting down to write this review. I have finally come to terms with the fact that I don't love the newest Downtown Phoenix gem, I simply Like. I had my first visit to District last night after I made a last minute decision to go celebrate my birthday a little early with Mr. Hottie. I was a little worried about getting a reservation at such short notice, but to my surprise, I was able to secure an 8:30pm reservation over the phone. We arrived dressed to kill and feeling excited to try the new restaurant. We opted to use the valet which is free for the first 3 hours of your visit when you get your ticket validated. We were greeted very warmly by the valet attendants and directed to the restaurant. When the doors to the hotel opened, the first words out of my mouth were "Oooh Pretty!" The open floor plan of the entire place was just breathtaking. As we walked toward District, I even noticed the "New Hotel Smell" which was nice!When we got to District we were met by the hostess who found our reservation and walked us to our table. We were seated close to a big picture window with a nice view of the street. Our waitress, Anastasia introduced herself and subsequently butchered Mr. Hottie's last name (under the assumption it was also my last name) and said "Heard it was your birthday! Happy Birthday!" Ugh...maybe I was just hungry and cranky. She asked us if we had been there before and went on to describe the style of food, and when I asked who her chefs were, she asked if I was with Starwood. Um...no. I didn't let her know that a review would soon be written about this new spot. After she finished stumbling through who the chefs were, we were given a basket of black bean & corn rolls with a jar of chow chow & a flavored butter drizzled with honey. I wished the rolls were warm. I think they would have been so much better and possibly release the full flavor of the butter. I tried the chow chow. Wow. I was immediately transported to Louisiana at my Grandpa's kitchen table. Talk about fresh, crispy and tangy good! We ordered a drink before dinner. I had a glass of Mumm Brut Sparkling Wine; Mr. Hottie ordered the Ocean martini after our waitress stumbled through the ingredients of each martini. She couldn't remember the names of the alcohols that were used in the drinks. After a bit, it was like we were playing a round of an alcohol themed guessing game. Slightly annoying, but again, I thought maybe I was being over critical. It was time to order the food. To start, I chose the chicken tortilla soup. Mr. Hottie chose the local field greens and herbs. The soup was served in a large bowl that came with diced chicken, diced queso blanco, diced avocado, a large dollop of sour cream and thin strips of tortilla chips. The soup is then poured over the ingredients. Talk about delicious. The soup was creamy and savory. The only thing I wished it had was just a little spicy kick, but the soup was so good on it's own. Mr. Hottie said the salad was just ok. The dressing seemed to be a little light in flavor that the goat cheese over powered the salad's flavor. Just prior to having our main entrees served we had ordered a glass of wine to go with our meal. We were well into our meal once the glasses arrived. Points off. Oh well, on to the main event.For my entree, I had the Grilled Ribeye rare. The steak came with skillet potatoes, Toy Box tomatoes and was topped with chimchurri. The steak was perfectly cooked and the meat was extremely tender. I was delighted by the quality of the meat. The only bad thing about it was that it was a very fatty steak even for a Ribeye. It should have been a bit more trimmed up. The tomatoes were fresh and provided a nice bit of acid to the rich plate of meat and potatoes. Mr. Hottie had the Brown Ale Short Ribs. The entree came cheddar jalapeno grits and the meat was topped with roasted carrots. What can I say about the dish? The grits were an absolute tragedy. They were runny and came with a skin over the top of them. The grits were just soupy and disappointing. The short rib was very good. It wasn't fatty rather it was a rich slice of meat that was well seasoned. I didn't try the small bits of carrots that came on top of the short rib but they looked very good! For dessert I was offered a complimentary hot fudge sundae. I was full, but accepted it for the sake of trying it. The sundae came with a cold brownie. The "hot fudge" was lukewarm chocolate sauce.  So yes, you guessed it, points off. Our waitress comes fumbling back to our table to deliver the check and states that she gave us the wrong (and subsequently cheaper) wine. Ah. Points off.  A neat ending to the meal was the free cotton candy. I don't know if I'll return to District. Maybe to try some of their other small plates, and have a few drinks. It just isn't the great dining experience I was expecting, and I'm ok with that.This was really 3.5 stars and I'm rounding down to 3 for a few reasons...on which I will now elaborate.District could be in any Sheraton, anywhere.  In fact, it is strikingly similar to Rum Fire, the trendy restaurant in the Sheraton Waikiki where I stayed for a few days this summer before my family arrived and we stayed moved to the family place.  The flooring, the red circular lounge area, the live music on Thursday nights...it was all the same.  Heck, even the menu was the same.  The difference was that in Waikiki there was a "Hawaiian" slant to everything and the live music was much, much better.  (And of course the beach front setting).  I get the impression that they are trying to market themselves as a "downtown restaurant" more than the "place in the Sheraton"...but to be honest, it is your quintessential trendy hotel restaurant.The bartenders were really friendly.  The wine list for a "wine bar" is incredibly lacking.  Nothing interesting, nothing fun.  The pricing is on par with what I would expect from a hotel.  The space is modern and trendy, something that there isn't that much of in downtown.  I love the charm of a historic home, but I also love sleek and modern lines.We selected a few small plates, or appetizers, depending on which of their menus you are looking at.  The crab cakes were good, if nothing short of predictable, and the chips and dip were surprisingly unique.  A dill dip and a French onion dip provided a nice departure from the regular spinach artichoke.  I'm not sure this is a place that I would come to for dinner, and it is definitely not a place I would come to for brunch.  (The brunch menu is a typical hotel menu, with typical hotel pricing).  I think that for me District will just remain a place for drinks and small bites.  I'm not going to lose my mind over this place.  It's not that great, I'd say it's fairly generic.  But the staff was friendly and it's within walking distance of my place.  I'm sure I will be back for drinks.Umm, made from scratch Sloppy Joes and fancy Mac and Cheese?? Pshh, you had me at Sloppy baby...The fact that there are any sub-par reviews of this place shocks the hell out of me. I had my third meal at District last night, and just like my previous two, it was spectacular.In the business of full disclosure, my friend and I were going to try Moira for the first time, but alas it was closed, and obviously a sign because we stumbled a few blocks further south to District and had quite the satisfying meal.We walked in about 6:45, and I'm sad to report the place was empty.  We took a seat at a cocktail table in the bar area so I could watch the hockey game (seriously, I am a dream date) and perused the bar menu. A nicely mannered waitress approached us almost immediately and remained attentive and helpful throughout our entire meal.The coolest thing about the bar menu was their new take on the pairing menu.  No longer do you have to be a wine conosseur to enjoy the Chef's special menu.  District offers three separate 3 course tasting menus, one featuring a wine pairing, one featuring a cocktail pairing, and one featuring a beer pairing all for between $12 and $14!  I mean, how cool is that?  I challenge you to find a better bargain for such high-quality fare complete with booze...give it up, you can't, I've looked.  If you don't know already, District offers about 10 or 12 different Microbrews on tap an obvious plus for a beer drinker like myself.Being the difficult diner that I am, I asked for the Sloppy Joe Sliders off the beer pairing menu so I could get a couple other small things and try a bunch.  Yes, I am an adult, and no, I can't not order a Sloppy Joe when it is featured on a menu, I'm sorry, I just can't.And thank goodness I lack that sense of propriety because the Sloppy Joe Sliders were freaking fantastic!! 3 perfectly sized mini toasted buns filled with possibly the best, spiciest Sloppy Joes I have ever eaten. Seriously, I sucked down my Apricot Ale seemingly in seconds thanks to the District's take on this classic!  Just don't tell my Mom, she still convinced I'm quite fond of her Mamwich Joes...I also had to get a side of their Andouille infused Macaroni and Cheese, another embarrassing thing that I just can't not order if it's offered on a menu, and it did not disappoint.  Cheezy, creamy, gooey perfection. My only complaint is that I was so full from my Joes I barely made a dent in my Mac n Cheese...alas, there's always next time.My dining companion ordered what must have been the biggest freaking burger I have ever seen, but to be honest I did not really look or care because I was far too enamored with my meal to be distracted by anything else.All in all, I had a spectacular meal at the District, from beginning to end.  If you haven't checked out this gem at the new Downtown Sheraton, do yourself a favor, you'll be in for a treat.OMG I'm stuffed.  I think I need a wheelchair to get around the office now...O gawd!So my coworker took me out to lunch today, and this is where she took me.  Its right outside of my office, so all we really have to do is cross the street to get to it.  I've been in here before, and always love it.Place is obviously well decorated.  Service is quick and friendly.  I liked thier menu selections.  ordered a cheeseburger, which came with fries!  I loved the presentation of it!  Fries came in a brown baggie!  My friends Mayo came in a tiny little one serving bottle.  Very pleasing to the eyes!   Food here is tasty, and delicious!  On the fancier side for having a burger, but Im not to much of a fancy eater these days. The burger itself was really delicious.  I got it with Cheese.  The only thing is that the fries were horribly oversalted!! UGH.  I couldn't even finish them!  My one coworker who eats here all the time said that the fries are always WAY to salty and is unsure of who to talk to about it.  Being that I dont eat here often, Im not sure either..plus, since Im not a regular, I dont want to go in there and be like "hey your fries are ALL ENTIRELY salt" and then leave....blah. Anyways...Place was great, will return in a heartbeat!Decided to take a road trip from south Scottsdale and have dinner downtown.  Within walking distance of our next stop, District fit the bill.  I was really impressed with the design of the restaurant.  Great windows, lots of trees, inside and out, nice patio complete with a hungry kitty I spotted.  I was surprised by the lack of customers on Saturday night, but it was Halloween.I decided to try something new and not have a meal before the meal, so we skipped appetizers.  They do serve bread before the meal, but it's just a standard dinner roll that really should be served warm, but isn't.  For my entree, I had the cedar roasted salmon with risotto.  The salmon was served on the plank with crispy shallots.  The preparation was simple, no special sauce or anything, but the fish was cooked perfectly.  The risotto was filled with shrimp, asparagus, and parmesan cheese.  Although maybe just a little on the salty side, it was delicious.  My husband had the lobster pot pie.  When it's presented, you will think it's ginormous, but it's really just the puffed pastry.  Once you pop it, it's a manageable portion.We opted to share a dessert and went with pecan pie spring rolls.  These, too, were served on a plank with a caramel dipping sauce and bourbon chantilly.  Quite good, although I thought the plank made it awkward to share this dessert.  And speaking of sharing, you may want to ask about portion size before opting to share.  Our dessert was three small rolls that was perfect to share if you just want a little something sweet.  But if you expect to completely indulge, might want to order your own.  Unless, you're going to stick with the complimentary cotton candy at the end of the meal.  If they had a carousel out front, you could save a lot and skip the fair!As far as service, it is a little slow.  But it's slow as in "relax and enjoy your evening" slow, not "where the hell is my stinkin' food" slow.  And the server did ask if we had a theater performance to catch, so it appears they make the effort to ensure you're out on time.Definitely worth coming to again sometime!2.5 starts for really crappy service!!!For such a nice place, you'd think they'd have better service.  Holy frijoles, it sucked!  I went for the game night that Glenn and Bri planned.  I finally saw a guy walk by in a suit and said (in my not-so-quiet voice) "I'll never come back here again."  He came right to our table with more Yelpers and said "Are you guys the Yelpers?"  I had to actually raise my hand, like in 3rd grade, the rest of the night to get refills on my drink.The food was good.  Only good.  The crab cakes were AWESOME.  Huge hunks of crab, and only crab, coated with a light crumb and served on a sauce with REAL horseradish.  The fries?  Not so good.  Their only saving grace was that they were coated in Old Bay seasoning.  They were just normal shoestring fries, though.I really doubt I would go back just to eat.  The ambience is really nice, though.  I just think that for a hotel restaurant, which in itself is in the HOSPITALITY industry, they'd have better service.  At one time, our server even changed color!  He said he was from Cuba.  I called him Fidel.  He laughed.I know I enjoy food when I think about how good it was later..like days and days later. It has been about a week and I am still craving the Mac n' Cheese I inhaled during my Happy Hour visit. The Macaroni was cooked to perfection, the cheese was the perfect consistency and texture, and the addition of spicy sausage really set the dish apart. While the service was impossibly slow, every waiter I came in contact with was extremely nice. But nice or not, I was sucking on melted ice for half the night while I waited to get my drinks refilled. No bueno. The atmosphere was relaxing and casual, and the bathrooms were fabulous!! Well lit, great aroma, and my choice between cloth hand towels or paper. The bathroom had well placed mirrors which made the space feel big and clean.I will definitely come back, but next time I might sneak in my own drink.I've been to District a few times - both for lunch and for dinner... It's a great place to meet if you are heading to the Herberger for a show or if you find yourself in the heart of downtwon PHX either hungry or thirsty.  They make a great burger and have some really awesome happy hour deals on both food and drinks.  I will mention however, that the service isn't so spot on.  Most recently, I sat at the bar with my dad.  We had just over an hour to order and eat before heading to see ATC's production of Lombardi at the Herberger, so we weren't super rushed, but I also knew it wouldn't be the most leisurely meal.  The bartenders didn't address us when we sat down.  After more than five or ten minutes, I finally got their attention and was told they'd be with us in just a moment... I went to the hostess stand to grab menus, and several minutes later, they finally addressed us and took our drink order.  We both went with burgers and I also ordered a Caesar Salad.  My salad never arrived, but I didn't mention it... I was just happy that our burgers came out with enough time for us to scarf them down before the show.  I will say - the burger was cooked just right and worth the wait!Bottom line: From my experience, District is A-OK for their location and happy hour, but I probably wouldn't suggest it as a destination for the evening on its own!I love this place and so do my clients and colleagues who are downtown.  They never hesitate when I book a lunch meeting here.  There are so many interesting items on the menu, but my favorite is the Chef's Trio.  The last visit, this is what was on the Trio:Chef Trio (Beef Soup, Potato Salad w/Bacon, Veggie Calzone), $10http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/district-american-kitchen-and-wine-bar-phoenix-2?select=g6iPj5WpOU-IUMDzdGwXTw#g6iPj5WpOU-IUMDzdGwXTwhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/district-american-kitchen-and-wine-bar-phoenix-2?select=q-jiqBVGITDHYrfW2nwkhQ#q-jiqBVGITDHYrfW2nwkhQhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/district-american-kitchen-and-wine-bar-phoenix-2?select=BJBGLXK8LcaZtear6hwTOQ#BJBGLXK8LcaZtear6hwTOQhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/district-american-kitchen-and-wine-bar-phoenix-2?select=4E90w9JyCNDGIJ2szOhhtg#4E90w9JyCNDGIJ2szOhhtgI started with the Beef Soup, which was simply AMAZING!  The Beef was of high quality and full of flavor.  Just the right portion size too.  Next I had the Veggie Calzone....I have to admit, I was a little skeptical of that part of the dish, but they delivered....it was awesome.  The best part of the dish though was the Potato Salad w/Bacon.....that's right folks, it has BACON in it!!!  It tastes as good as it sounds.  The Bacon does not overwhelm the flavor of the Potato Salad, it compliments it.  It also has very sharp flavors and rounds out the trio dish well.  Well done chef, well done!I can't wait until our next lunch downtown!Return Factor - 95%

I have to go on the record as saying that this place is great! The Mr and I were out in QC picking up porky bits at the Pork Shop and wanted to try something new out there. Seeing that this place has been on my radar for ages it was about to to give it a try. I am kind of surprised that no one has been out here and Yelped it yet. This place is amazing!! Chef driven, artisan, seasonal menu and specials with great pricing it doesn't get much better than this. After browsing their farmers market (Saturdays only) and being greeted by an really super nice guy (I'm presuming one of the owners) we had a really good vibe on the place. The inside is both comfortable and relaxed with Led Zepplin and the Beatles playing in the background. We started with the Warm Prosciutto Wrapped House Made Mozzarella ($4.50).. all I have to say is that I wish I had a nice glass of red to go with this tasty treat! The prosciutto was awesome but the house pulled mozzarella, to die for! In fact it was so good we asked to buy a pound to go! On the plate was also a nice slathering of pesto to compliment each bite.. this stuff should be jarred and sold! If I wouldn't come off as rude and desperate I would have easily licked the plate.Next up we shared a side of their house made dill pickles ($1.50).. a nice bowl filled with tender well spiced pickles.. man, I sure love a nice pickle! Juicy with slightly crunchy tenderness these were so good I just about scarfed the bowl myself. Next up we ordered Marinated Mushroom ($3.50) which came with toasted slices of Simply Bread cibatta. Each tender bite was a flavor explosion of earthy sweet balsamic tastiness, here comes that wine craving again. The deal here is that I'm low carbin' so it took some restraint not to tear into the bread with the mushrooms. Fortunately the Mr isnt low carbin' so I was able to live vicariously through him, he shook his head in pleasure.  Up next were our lunch entrees, the Mr had the 1/2 Cuban Sandwich and a bowl of soup ($9). The soup was sausage white bean that I could smell from across the table. He went ahead and got me a nice spoon full of seasoned broth and a large thick slice of sausage. Okay there is soup and there is soup, this was excellent. Hot, creamy and deeply satisfying this was one of the quality your Italian grandmother would have made for you as a kid! The Cuban sandwich was huge tender slices of Roast Pork, Ham melted Provolone, House Sweet Pickles, Dijon Aioli on Ciabatta Bread. Uh, come on now, seriously? This is just about everything you could ask for in a sandwhich. Chewy fresh baked bread, hot slices of slightly salty meats and melted cheese, major love was dripping from this sandwich.My lunch was the Chopped Chef Salad w/ Romaine Hearts, Turkey, Bacon, Tomatoes, Cucumbers, Egg, Red Onion, Avocado & Blue Cheese Dressing ($12). Low cabin' doesn't get much better than this! Each bite was absolutely different with combination of so many fresh and tasty ingredients. Pay close attention to the turkey, they roast it in house along with the roast pork in the Cuban. They take simple ingredients and combine them to create such delicious hearty flavors all working in unison. While The Deli is out of the way it is so worth the drive to Queen Creek for lunch or dinner. Please take the drive, I seriously don't think you're going to be disappointed one bit!

Review Text :
For the Coronado district, Tuck is the most exciting thing we've seen in quite some time to arrive in the neighborhood.  Walking and driving past it, we've been watching the restaurant being built with lots of anticipation and excitement of what was going to arrive.  So I was really excited to walk by this past Thursday to see it open for business.  I went in just to grab a menu, and instead met the bartender and manager, and enjoyed a great Four Peaks Coronado Ale and got to find out what the place is all about.  The decor of the restaurant is beautiful: There is great art work covering the walls from a Tucson artist that is all for sale, and the mismatched chairs with the quaint reading room off to the side, combined with the wood detail throughout the bar was beautiful.  The bathrooms were even amazingly decorated with the greatest sinks!  Anyways, I went back tonight to finally have a full meal to find a completely packed house.  For only being open a week, I couldn't get over the fact that it seemed like everyone from the neighborhood was there and then some, it was so great to see. But, back to the food- I finally got to try my prosciutto and mac and cheese, and it was amazing!  Followed up with a dirty martini, it was definitely a great meal and experience. My only fear is that it is going to turn into a constant happy hour spot for when I walk past it on the way home from work...Don't go here- it's terrible!!.........OK, in all honesty, I've been putting off writing a review on Tuck Shop because I love it so much and fear that I may never be able to get a table once the word gets out. That said, I have been here 4 times already and it's been outstanding every time. John the manager is awesome, as are all the servers. The place is cozy and inviting- it kind of feels like a swanky ski lodge with mod furniture where all your friends hang out. The menu is split up into starters, small plates and larger entree-sized items which are suitable for sharing, but you certainly don't have to. Some of my favs are the fish and chips, the chorizo stuffed dates, the fried chicken and cheese waffles, and the anchovy-stuffed potatoes. They also sometimes have a Bananas Foster dessert that is to die for. Very unique and fresh menu.For the atmosphere, quality and variety of food, the prices are reasonable, and they have an eclectic and reasonably priced drink menu as well. Combine all this with the fact that I can walk here from my house pretty much ensures a long standing love affair.After reading a few reviews I was really tricked into thinking the portions would be minuscule. Like french-modern-cuisine tiny, but luckily I was wrong. I erred on the side of thinking the portions would be small so I ordered us two starters but we could have just done with one. However, they were both drool-worthy. One was the baguette with creamy garlic, it consisted of  6 slices of bread with a whole garlic cooked until it's spreadable covered in olive oil and spices. Basically you scoop a clove out and spread it on the bread. This was good, like drool-on-you-keyboard-good (DOYKG). We also ordered the Nosh plate,a typical melon, meat, cheese and nuts plate. Everything on that was tasty and both would have been great alone, but I'm glad we tried both.For main courses my gf ordered the mac and cheese with prosciutto and breadcrumbs and liked it. I had Vovo's special which is a rotating special. Last night it was the tamale and tortilla soup. We both liked our dishes and were stuffed. I was a little envious after seeing another couple's dish. They ordered the chicken and waffles. It wasn't your typical soul food style but it looked tasty regardless. We both had wine. Gf had the Rose which she thought was a little dry and I wasn't too fond of either. I had the Tempranillo which I liked but wasn't amazing. That's probably the only gripe, I wish their wine list was deeper.All in all the place was awesome and a great date destination. Romantic lighting and original decor and architecture, good for conversation starters.The crowd was older that I expected, not a negative just an observation, although it was a Thursday and that might change on weekends. The service was nice and the free after dinner snack. Chocolate covered cookie dough was like pastry crack and also (DOYKG).Side note: The prices aren't cheap but they won't break you. Especially if you go to other establishments in the same area. My tab for this meal was $60 which is good I think. Two sides, two glasses of wine, one main course and one small course. Not bad as far as I'm concerned.I really enjoy this place. It's beautifully designed. It's hidden in a historic neighborhood, (zoning issues so no patio), and they make they own tonic! ---What else does one need? But now the food. Rich, full flavored, comfort food. I don't think there is a cuisine style here as far as I could tell, just some of the best food around. Had the fontina crusted with pinko and walnuts, awesome. A potato side dish, damn good I tell you. For the main course the skirt steak, which was some of the best red meat I'm had in a very, very long time. This is my vote for best new restaurant in Phoenix. Seriously.A late night cocktail was the occasion for my first visit to Tuck Shop, where I sat on a couch with friends, surrounded by water games popular in the late '70s early '80s (and other novelties) and enjoyed a Pimm's and housemade ginger ale. It was a classic, comfortable environment and I couldn't wait to come back! In spite of our group's VERY late arrival, the staff was so gracious and accommodating. (Plus, I loved, loved, loved my drink!!) When I returned for dinner, I was not disappointed! We started with panko walnut-crusted fontina which was offered with two dipping options: a roasted red pepper one,  which I expected to prefer, and pear and onion, which, surprised me and made the best partner! A lovely upscale twist on the traditional "fried cheese" appetizer.That's how this whole place is, though. It takes something you're used to and kicks it up a few! Take for example the yukon jacket potatoes - not your typical roasted potatoes; these are cored and threaded with bacon, anchovy and sage. The presentation was very cool. And, the cores that also appear on the plate are delicious topped with lemon zest and olive oil! Sticking with a "meat and potatoes" theme, we had the spiced skirt steak which was tender and well seasoned -- served on the rare side. It filled a large plate and resulted in left overs even though two of us were sharing! The mushrooms were so good, I would order them as a side on another visit if that were an option!! For me, the most overwhelming flavor in the parmesan lentil mashed potatoes was BUTTER! But, when it comes to mashed potatoes that is NOTHING to complain about: It was creamy heaven!  I couldn't possibly find anything to complain about with Tuck Shop. Generally, I despise sitting at community tables but we didn't think quickly enough to decline (although, we were asked if it was OK) when getting seated. Although, in the future I would prefer my own table, the people we were seated with were so nice and friendly. We wound up sharing our food!Finally, in case you missed it in the other reviews: Move over Andes! There's a a ball of raw cookie dough - that's right. You heard me: cookie dough! Rolled in chocolate that comes with your bill. I whole heartedly recommend checking this place out for a nice classy, cozy meal!When they say neighborhood, they aren't kidding, literally in the Coronado residential neighborhood at 12th street and Oak, the restaurant lives in an old building that once housed the Arizona Showmen's Association. The rehab has been lovingly restored by its owner DJ Fernandes who is also not by coincidence an architect. When pulling up you can see such attention to detail and design from the concrete stamped handicapped spot, to the interesting lights and exterior brushed stainless door pulls. When entering the building be sure to check out the signage made up of letter building blocks, clever and grounding. Rehabilitation like this helps make the Phoenix area so interesting and original.The inventive menu was designed by DJ, his girlfriend Jessica Ruiz and chef/consultant Mitch Hoverman, who interestingly also opened Palette. The idea is to share plates amongst a group of friends, though you can easily put together a traditional 3 course meal if that is what suits you best. We opted to share our plates so we could try as many as possible. To best describe the menu it would be eclectic, with Creole, French and Spanish twists. There are 3 sections to chose from, Start, Smaller Plates and For Sharing, the menu is accessible and interesting.Starting things out, while the grilled baguette ($5) might sound ordinary, its crispy and light goodness comes from Simply Bread. Accompanied is a whole head of roasted garlic and finished with Bariani olive oil. The Bariani is essentially liquid gold with its grassy mild and pure unfiltered flavor. If there is any left in the bowl when you're done don't let the waiter take it away, it's to precious to be wasted and will taste great on just about anything. Together with the nosh plate ($7) it's all about simple clean flavors. Salted melon, Molinari &amp; Sons salami, manchego cheese and toasted pistachio's were so delicious it was hard to share though there was plenty for all. Panko walnut-crusted fontina ($6) was perfectly crunchy and with each bite the melted strands of the fontina cheese were delightful and satisfying. Patatas bravas ($5) are classic tapas however the Tuck version turns potato cubes into long thick planks served along side of 2 dipping sauces. The planks were lightly crispy and well seasoned, though dipped into the aioli and the spicy tomato sauce together was good, love came from dipping into the remaining Bariani olive oil.Working into the Smaller Plates menu, the panini bites with prosciutto ($9) were so good we were squabbling over the last piece. A nice slab of ciabtta bread stuffed with grilled pear, taleggio cheese, arugala and honey was a sweet and savory combo that has to be tasted and savored. Order 2, one for the table and another wrapped up to go for lunch the next day. Another contrasting sweet and savory small plate would be the medjool dates stuffed with chorizo and topped with melted gruyere ($9). I've had many of stuffed dates, but never like this, spicy and sweet, chewy and meaty, very nice! The mac and cheese with crispy prosciutto, topped with breadcrumbs and lobster ($12) was sublimely creamy and tender, like a really good hug where you just melt into his arms, bury your face into his chest while you're enveloped in comfort and security. Who knew mac and cheese could make you feel so good?!Turning our attentions to the citrus-brined fried chicken ($17) was a sight to behold. 3 large, generously battered pieces of deep fried passion caused instant salivation. I have to say that this was the juiciest tenderest fried chicken I've ever had the pleasure of sinking into. The crunchy coating, the moist flavorful chicken and the slight citrus after taste were absolute perfection. Along side was a large white cheddar waffle, slathered in maple butter and a bowl of pork laden collard greens. The waffle had a light, fluffy and almost mashed potato consistency that was fork tender and soaked up the chicken juices easily. The collards were nice and porky with that slight bitterness only tempered by salt and sugar.  This plate was simply amazing!For the beef eaters there is a spiced skirt steak ($18) served with parmesan lentil mashed yukons and mushrooms, that was so hearty and delicious, I can't imagine having this anywhere else.There is usually only one way to finish a good meal like this and that's with my favorite self proclaimed food group, chocolate. We all tore into the chocolate brownie and almond cream ($7) with a vengeance. You could tell with each bite that this was no box mix, crackly shininess on top, moist and crumbly, this was a great brownie. If this is too much you will also a receive a 1 bite postre with your check. On this night it was raw chocolate chip cookie dough with a slathering of melted dark chocolate, happy ending!The stars are aligned for the Tuck Shop. With all of their elements in near perfect cohesion, this will soon be one of the coolest and freshest places to eat, drink, and of course share.Don't get me wrong ... this is an AWESOME place, just not for me.We originally planned to go to Lo-Lo's but it was closed, so we headed here (as I knew they had Chicken and Waffles) instead. The chicken was over done (just like my Mommy used to make) and the waffle, well it was "fancy" (not your normal waffle which is what I had kinda wanted). Don't get me wrong it was okay, just different and came with no syrup, 'cause it was cheese based and that wouldn't work so well.Our real server was kinda pushed out by another server (thank GOD, as our "real" server looked like he had a few years of substance abuse behind him) and our new one was GREAT. We collectively assumed that that this our original servers last night at the place.That said my girl absolutely loved the food so take my review with a grain of salt. Also it should be duly noted that the place is incredibly hip and beautiful, and drink prices reasonable (two great Four Peaks beers on-tap).So here's the deal ... go here and ignore this review (sorry I wasted your time). :)Oh shit! I almost forgot ... the free desert (chocolate cookie dough is the freakin' greatest treat any restaurant has ever given me ... EVER!)I like Tuck Shop. I like when you first walk up to the building, you feel like you're walking into a small day care center (note the building blocks out front). When you walk into the building, you're in a cozy space that reminds one of a hip and modern cabin feel. I've been to Tuck about 3 times now and each time I leave happy. It starts with the host. There's nothing like being greeted like a regular when you've only been in once or twice. I love how friendly the Host, John, is. On my last visit, we had a group of 7 and we didn't have a reservation on a Saturday evening. John was more than accommodating. He invited us to sit at the bar while he made arrangements to get our rowdy (post beer festival) group in to eat. The way I would describe the food at Tuck is "home cooked meals made fancy". There is a variety of things to try! If you are a vegetarian, some dishes can be made meatless, but not all. If you want something spicy and with a lot of kick, try the red beans and rice. I think that's my favorite dish so far. My least favorite is the chicken and waffle. The chicken was good, and flavorful, but the waffle wasn't interesting to me. I was wishing for some syrup or a cool sauce to go along with the dish. Tuck also offers small plates that are tapas-like. Go for the patatas bravas for a simple appetizer. Tuck Shop is, in my opinion, a neighborhood jewel. It offers comforting dishes and great drinks, not to mention good service. I have made Tuck Shop one of my regular noshing spots!I love this place. The concept of sharing really does it for me (thanks mom). You get to try so many dishes instead of just one, it's like taking your taste buds on an adventure. I've been here twice now and already have some faves: Nosh plate - melons, salami, manchego, pistachios Dates - stuffed with chorizo and gruyereMac and Cheese - with prosciutto and breadcrumbsI can't wait to go back and try the waffle fries. Oh yea and they have Tito's vodka. Big Score!Everything about this place is out of the norm in a very good and inviting way. Major points on the curb appeal from rock wall to innovative use of nostalgic wooden letter blocks as signage. The attention to detail is refreshing and appreciated.  The interior is welcoming and the creative use of space is impressive. How does one fit a lounge, bar and dinning area in such a tight space and mitigate claustrophobia? This is worthy of an HGTV episode.  Tuck has done it & done it well! The menu is just as creative and unique in its own right. I've enjoyed the roasted grape crostini, chorizo stiffed dates, mac & cheese w/lobstah, special meatloaf with potatoes & chorizo and the chocolate cheese cake. All hit high marks for flavor, portion and presentation. The service is consistently impeccable from courteous host to attentive but non-intrusive servers. I always feel welcomed and appreciated!  Tuck Shop is in my top five places I love and enjoy introducing to friends, co-workers, and out of town guests. It holds a very warm place in my heart with many fun and special memories.I feel like it's been forever since Tuck Shop opened and it's taken me all the way until now to actually go!  That has more to do with the fact that I have the eating habits of a geriatric and like to eat at 4, and places like this don't open until 5.  My first impressions were that this was a very cute little restaurant with homey touches here and there but not without it's own modern flair.  The tables and chairs are all mismatched, but thankfully at appropriate heights.  I liked the faux ceiling that gave the impression that it was lower in the middle, but I can see other people really hating that.  The staff was all friendly and knowledgeable and the guy who I am guessing is the owner had some really amusing shorts on.The food was wonderful.  There was lots that looked good on the menu to us, and it was too difficult to narrow it down to one sharing plate, on top of the appetizer and small plate we ordered, so we went ahead and got two.  We started with the walnut crusted fontina, and that was delicious.  It was served with a sweet and earthy pear sauce as well as a roasted red pepper sauce.  They were delicious when swirled together.  Next we had the mac and cheese with the lobstah added.  I really liked the mac and cheese.  It was tender with a real down home sauce with just the right amount of cheesy flavor and warmth.  The lobster was quite unique.  It had a great woody flavor that I didn't expect but I found to be really appropriate for the dish.  Finally, I had the citrus brined fried chicken and white cheddar waffle.  It was ambrosial.  The chicken was the best fried chicken I have ever had.  It was intensely crispy and the citrus brine gave it a whole new flavor profile that I was not ready for.  The white cheddar waffle was yummy, but a little too eggy for my liking.  It did however, go extremely well with the chicken,I really enjoyed my visit here, and I hope to come back sometime soon.I still love this place! The menu has some seasonal changes. Right now, you won't find the  panko walnut-crusted fontina or the yukon jacket potatoes but you WILL find "crispy shrimp and okra" which are fried treats that have both shrimp and okra in each puff! Delicious! And, oyster po'boy popovers (4 per order) which made some in our party think of Big Macs - only with oysters. Fortunately, the pine spiced skirt steak is still available -- with those "to-die-for" mashed potatoes. BUT, it's a tough decision now with the juicy pork t-bone, perfectly crisp green beans and tasty squash gnocchi.Bottom line is: this place rules! You can't make a bad order. And, it's all about sharing any way. Isn't that what our world needs more of? Places that promote sharing!!Oh WOW!!!! I've only heard about this place through the reviews on Yelp, and from those alone I KNEW I had to go here! So the hubs and I set out on Saturday night at about 630ish. We arrived and it was already pretty busy. All the tables were seated and there were people in the lounge area. However the bar was open, and we could be seated immediately, so we snagged a couple stools. We were hungry and wanted to try a couple things. For starters we got the cheese curds and the fries and gravy. The curds were ok, I would have liked a crunchier batter on them, but they were seasoned very well. the Fries and gravy were the show stopper of the appetizers! herbed parsnips and potato's, Gruyere cheese and THE MOST heavenly mushroom gravy. Seriously soooooo good! Next up were the shrimp po'boys. They are served on freaken popovers!!!! These little gems were mouth watering! And I really don't eat a whole lot of shrimp, but damn! Last was the main event. Citrus brined fried chicken and white cheddar cheese waffles! GOOD LORD!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I cant stop thinking about that meal! We had a couple glasses of wine and some of that house made ginger ale, phenominal!The bartender/our waitress was soooo friendly, loved her! The atmosphere was pretty chill. The location is kinda ghetto...not the building, its beautiful, but its in a neighborhood that's a touch iffy, but whatev, I'll go anywhere for great food! Oh yeah, and I forgot to mention, they bring a little ball of cookie dough out as a bite of dessert, FOR FREE! Just the right amount after the feast we had! We will for sure be going back, hopefully the bar will be open, because they were quoting people 45 minute waits all night long and I am sooo not down for that kind of wait.This place has the MOST comfortable comfort food I have ever tried.... My night ended in a food coma. So there.We walked in and were seated right away. I love the feel of this place. Warm, welcome, quirky, and just the kind of place I really enjoy. I notice a few large windows near a sofa. Sparce soft lighting. Different wooden tables. A strip of wood panels on the ceiling. Plenty of bar seating.  Art on the walls. What more can a girl like me ask for?Food, that's what. Oh and a beverage!David approached our table to tell us about the drink specials and then gave us a few minutes to decide. We decided on a couple dark and stormies.... Best I've ever had. Really.We placed our order for food and just to have it come out as it was ready. First came the cheese curds. My favorite bar food. Lightly beer battered, seasoned to perfection and delicious!  Next came the mac and cheese. Saucy, creamy, rich and well seasoned. Covered in proscutto, bread crumbs, and lobstah! I have a weakness for really good mac and cheese. This one is way, way up there. Then our chicken and waffles came out! Three crispy pieces of fried chicken perfectly scortched and well seasoned greenbeans and a huge sweet, flaky waffle smothered in butter. Finally it was desert time. David told us that the deserts change every few weeks and named what was available. We chose the Brazilian banana bread pudding. This desert was perfect. My friend and I shared these plates. Don't try to conquer all of them on your own. You will really end up in a real food coma. So. Much. Good. Food. I might still be in said food coma...Xx,ReesieMeh...  I've had better.  The decor was pleasant and trendy, and the waitresses seemed very friendly (well except for the guy who sat us, he looked like he really didn't give a crap if we were there or not), but the food was just meh...  I had the lemonade and it was a perplexing mixture of not enough lemon or sweetener.  It tasted so watered down that I wasn't even sure it was lemonade, and the sweetness was just barely there.  I even asked the waitress what it was to confirm that I actually received the lemonade.  (Everyone is raving about it here though, so I must've had a VERY bad batch... ?)We shared some cheese curds and they were very tasty.  Horribly greasy, but quite tasty.I got the lobster mac and cheese.  My macaroni noodles were mushy, the cheese was too greasy (puddle at the bottom of the bowl) and salty, the lobster was overcooked and chewy and the whole bowl was boiling hot; a tell tale sign it had either been under a heat lamp or microwaved.  Not exactly the wonderfulness on a fork that I envisioned.My husband got the meatloaf that was on special that night.  The red sauce that it was swimming in was very spicy in an acidic way (which is not a good thing) and the acidic nature of the red sauce clashed badly with the more muted, cheesy scalloped potatoes that accompanied the meatloaf.Overall this as a pretty weak (and expensive) experience at a restaurant that I had MUCH higher hopes for.   I'll try it one more time to be fair and then I'll decide for good if I just hit it on a bad night, or if it's just a case of 'average food in a trendy setting, being over hyped by soulless hipsters who (in a bitter twist of irony) have almost NO taste of their own'...  Probably the case.So we came here for dinner and I started off with their Pinot Noir of course which was quite tasty... For our meal we ordered the Mac and cheese with lobster as well as the rib eye. The Mac and cheese was very creamy and delicious. It had a bit of a kick to it. The ribs were superrrrrr tender. Minus one star for the fact that its hard to locate. There's no huge sign or anything so its easy to miss. Its a really cute place for dinner or a date.So glad I finally got to try Tuck Shop and with two of my favorite Yelpers too boot!  Once I finally figured out where it was, I loved the warm and cozy feel.  Equally appropriate for date night or girls night.  Don't tell my husband, but girls night is usually more fun--they like WINE!!  And sharing means sharing, not I get one bite before it's gone.We had a few small plates, and none disappointed.  I was surprised to find myself loving the arancini, but it's amazing what these folks can do to rice.  And the stuffed dates with chorizo and gruyere?  That's sweet, spicy, creamy, and salty all rolled into one exceptional bite.  Also on the menu, mac 'n cheese for Shannon M (as if I didn't partake in this mini masterpiece) and a juicy steak with mushrooms and creamy mashed potatoes.   Deciding to  watch our calories, we shared only two desserts..pear upside down cake and a brownie.  I would say both were "edible."  And no need to even wash the plates. So, yep, I'm a fan.  A big one!I'm sure the food is great, I'm sure the service is great. Why the one-star review? They didn't have a highchair. I'm sorry if this comes across as entitled, but I didn't see a big sign on the door saying children not welcome, but by choosing not to purchase a $50 highchair, that's exactly what you're saying.We planned to have dinner with our well behaved, non-vomiting, non-screaming one-year-old, but by sending that very clear message that we are not welcome, guess what, we left and went somewhere else.

Review Text :
Being a (closet) fan of Jaimee Rose's  Azcentral blog, I had heard about Noca a few weeks ago. I always enjoy trying out new restaurants and admit to still being very unfamiliar with many of the well known establishments here in the Valley.Trusting her taste and the pictures and descriptions of the items, I was keen on going and what better a time than my birthday. We were a party of 5 and had the following:Parents: Kampachi and a suggestion from the waiter not on the menu but very tasty (linguini with shrimp).Girlfriend: PappardelleSister: DuckMyself: Spinach mezzalunaI have to commend our waiter. Very friendly but not overbearing. She was very familiar with the menu and was able to recommend some wines, which is usually something I don't do but felt comfortable doing with her. She was able to answer all our questions regarding some of the dishes we were unfamiliar with as well.Positives: Very class cozy ambiance. Restaurant was smaller and not exactly what I thought it would be with the "bigger is better" mentality I'm used to in the US but that takes nothing away from it on the contrary.Service is excellent for the most part. Never had to ask for water and the bussers and waiters always seem to have the right timing to refill your water or assist you. The quality of the food was exceptional, though the 1 star penalty goes towards the portions or "bang for your buck". I'd have wished for a few more mezzaluna's and other than my girlfriend's reasonable portion they did seem to be a bit too "european" even for my taste.The desserts really were the cherry on the cake. Perfect portions, very creative and tasty. You actually receive cotton candy at the end of your meal (regardless of a dessert or not I'm can't be sure). I really enjoyed the milk and cookies (excellent chocolate chip cookies provided with a cup of delicious vanilla milkshake). We also enjoyed the cheesecake dessert which consisted of rolled balls of cheesecake with a strawberry coulis and the small doughnuts with jelly were delicious as well. The best part was not footing the bill!Negatives (few but could use some improving):The delay between our order and receiving our food was probably 10-15 minutes. I'm used to having some bread in restaurants that I would consider "classy" or expensive and that was lacking here. They did provide an "amuse bouche" that was original but for some could be considered a bit odd. It consisted of a spoon of mint,melon and pop rocks, quite the party in your mouth and refreshing but not very filling for the wait.I definitely look forward to returning and trying out some of their other dishes. The desserts were exceptional and I'm quite certain a few clients came in just for those, similar to what I do with out of town visitors at Oregano's. All in all a pleasant and welcome surprise to the dining scene here in the valley.Wow.  It's really intimidating to try to write a review of Noca.  Honestly, it was a culinary experience that I find hard, even now (after some scribbling of notes) to sum up effectively in words.  It was wonderful, unquestionably 5 stars.  I'd recommend it to even my most picky friends, were they in the Phoenix area. But how do I explain just *how* enjoyable my food was here? I think that the best I can do is be extremely descriptive:Now, a disclaimer: I came here with other dining companions, so not everything I sampled did I eat all by myself.  I am neither that gluttonous, nor that flush in the pocketbook!  But, I truly did enjoy every bite. Started off with a nice, dry Anselmi Pinot Grigio, and a tempting little morsel that combined mushrooms with a light, flaky pastry. I sampled the spinach mezzaluna. It's silky ricotta melted on the tongue. For my main course, I selected Alaskan halibut. This was some of the best fish I've had.  The flavor of the fish came through, but I think the beurre rouge wasreally what accounted for that flavor -- while a cinnamon froth added just a slight kiss of sweetness.  The halibut was served with baby fennel and onions in a salsify tart.  The tart crust was wonderfully soft and flaky.For dessert, we indulged: The first thing that came seems to be a fun sort of Noca signature -- a large cloud of ultra-fresh cotton candy. We each grasped a nibble or two, but couldn't resist some of the other items on the dessert menu.The apple risotto is not risotto *with apples*. Instead, diced apples are cooked in a way that resembles the cooking of risotto.  A dollop of salt and butter ice cream (!) on top balances out the sweetness just right.  We also shared an order of doughnut holes -- cinnamon and sugar with a slightly crispy outside.  Three accompanying dipping sauces added a little extra to our sugar buzz -- my favorite was the dulce de leche. All throughout dinner, the restaurant was extremely busy (particularly for a weeknight), but our server didn't skip a beat.  Owner Elliot was making the rounds, telling us more about the restaurant and making recommendations. It's obvious that his heart is in this restaurant completely, and it show (and tastes) accordingly!Let me preface this by saying 5 stars do not give this foodie haven justice... this is probably the most delicious meal I've had... EVER!It was a Wednesday night and we had 8:00 reservations.  We walked in right on time and were greeted immediately by none other than Eliot Wexler, himself. He couldn't have been friendlier, seating us immediately (just the way it should be when you have a reservation)! I noticed that the restaurant was packed and everyone around us seemed to be enjoying themselves - that was a good sign!  Plus the fact that I bumped into Jenn H, and I know she's got good taste, so when she recommended a few of her favorite menu items, I listened!There were 3 of us dining, and I know we all enjoyed every moment, every sip, and every bite!  We each had a glass of wine to start - I went with the Kim Crawford Sauv Blanc.  Looking over the menu, it was difficult to decide on what to order - everything sounded unique and appealing.  After asking our waiter, Robert, for his opinion, I flagged Eliot down to ask what he thought between the Skate Wing and the Scallops.  He sold me on the Skate Wing... and I would order it again and again!  But before I get there, I have to mention that the table sampled the Gougere with mushroom duxelle and port wine syrup... (a special treat that was not on the menu).  We also tasted the Spinach Mezzaluna - a handmade ravioli stuffed with ricotta, mascarpone, and pecorino.  It was incredible!  I truly savored each bite! Oh, and how can I forget the fresh bread and olive oil brought to our table?  Truly, the freshest tasting olive oil... I'm not kidding!On to the entrees... (pictured above).  My companions fancied their scallops and halibut immensely.  We traded a bite for a bite so we could each try all three entrees too, and they were all pretty amazing.  I will say, however, that Eliot (and Jenn H) steered me right in suggesting the Skate Wing.  I pretty much licked my plate clean!We were all full after the entrees but decided that dessert would be a good ending to this phenomenal meal... so, what did we do?  On top of the cotton candy, we shared the donuts and the apple risotto.  We may as well do it right, right?  Wow!  We sure did do it right... the donut holes were served with 3 dipping sauces, and while I'm not a donut person, these were pretty amazing.  I hadn't treated myself to Cotton Candy since I was a little girl, so that was a fun addition of sugar shot right into my system... you have to have some, it's their signature dessert!  Finally, we went for one more indulgence... the apple risotto - oh, the apple risotto.  Fantastic!  Tiny pieces of apple sauteed with butter, sugar, honey, and more... topped with a salty butter flavored ice cream.  I know there were some additional ingredients that I'm missing here, but OMG... need I say more?In some of the press I've read about this place, it's referred to as "fine dining in a casual atmosphere at an accessible price." I would agree with that - although I do think the 'accessible price' part is relative.  I would consider this more of a 'special occasion' type of place because of the $$ you'll spend here - $50 pp more or less.  It's worth dumping out your piggy bank if you have to though... it's a culinary experience you won't forget!I'm already dreaming about my next visit!I've been putting off writing this review for a few weeks. I'm very torn on NOCA because I wanted it to be a 5 star experience, but it just wasn't. While it was very good in some aspects there were places where it fell short. I just can't sit here and say that this was the best dining experience of my life, in all honestly I'm not sure it cracks top 10. I found the dishes that I sampled to be hit or miss. I chose to not order an appetizer because my duck allergy prevented me from ordering 4/6 that are offered and I don't like beets. Which is not the fault of NOCA, but really left me with the green salad so I decided to forgo the appetizer entirely. We were presented with two chef's tastings. The first, Gougere with mushroom duxelle and port wine syrup, did not impress me, the pastry was entirely too hard and the plating was awkward. The second, Spinach Mezzaluna , which is essentially a ravioli, was absolutely divine. They ran out of several menu items before we could even order. Once our entrees arrived I found my scallops to be very good, but not perfect. Some were gritty and they still had a chewiness factor to them, not a melting factor. I do think they may have been the best I've had in Arizona, but not the best I've had in my life and not nearly as good as the ones I had enjoyed at SW in Vegas the previous week. The butternut squash gnocchi that they were served with didn't taste like gnocchi at all, but rather tasted like butternut squash balls. I sampled my companion's dishes and thought the skate was very good but I found the halibut to be dry. In addition to the cotton candy they give everyone we tried two desserts which were good. (We were also given a cookie to take home). My dining partners enjoyed the apple risotto dish we shared, however, I think the poached apple at Sol y Sombra is much better. I did think the doughnuts were well done, I've been running into a lot of bad doughnuts in restaurants lately so I was pleasantly surprised by them. The service was fantastic, although I found it amusing when our server explained to us what day boat scallops are....not just because I know what they are but, um, where are those day boats docking here in Phoenix? Elliot, the owner, was incredibly nice and kept coming over to talk to us. It is clear he is passionate about the restaurant. But for me it was lacking in that extra something. Its not a romantic place. Its loud. I think it would be great for friends. It kind of reminded me of one of my favorite places in Boston, Union, except the finishing touches weren't there. The mirrors on the walls didn't have frames, the leather booths did not look like the kind that should be in a restaurant of this caliber, the bar is in an awkward spot, the patio seating is directly on the sidewalk of the strip mall. Which may seem trite but for $3O an entree these little details should be considered. Unfortunately I am falling into that "in Phoenix this is good, but in Boston or NY it wouldn't be as good" situation, which is one that I absolutely hate to be in. I think NOCA could be great and there is a definite lack of a restaurant like this in Phoenix but for me it wasn't quite there. I've definitely had better food and enjoyed better atmospheres. I do plan on returning for one of their Simple Suppers to try them out again.I am in love! Oohhh, sorry not with you...but with NOCA! I cannot believe I have not been here sooner. I guess you find love when you least expect it. Since dinner here, I have not stopped thinking and fantasizing about this place. I knew it was going to be a great time when the charming guy at the door greeted us. We were seated promptly at a great table in the back.The chardonnay I ordered was one I have never tried, now its my new fav. I tried to make a point to remember the name of it but now I forget..I loved the little spoonful of Gorgonzola cheese mousse with the organic date. It was a tasty tease of what was to come. I had the lobster roll, which was the most divine thing that has crossed these lips in awhile. It was so full of flavor....limey, creamy, lobstery..yum! I could of done with out the fries, but they were as good as a fry can be covered in aioli dip. Usually I don't do dessert, especially on the first visit but one look at the menu and I had to have something! I chose the milk and cookies, which sounded fun. And fun and delish it was! The cookies were almost like cake and I enjoyed dipping them into every last drop of the milkshake. Its the desert that I am definitely still thinking about. The cotton candy that they brought out at the end was a really cute touch I thought. I thought that was the end after 2 rounds of dessert but no...they had to really top it of with the chocolate chip shortbread to bring home! What restaurant does that?! Who doesn't like a tasty treat to bring home? So that basically put me over the edge and I had to proclaim my love. Too bad I'm moving out of state....but maybe it's a good thing because I am sure this love affair would cause my waist line to expand.I stumbled on to a gem! I was walking out of Safeway realizing we were not going to make it to the movies on time if we took our chances at Giuseppe's when I glanced over and saw Noca. Strip Mall location and all we decided to give it a try.  The place was packed so we took a seat at the bar and our server/bartender was very and attentive and amusing.This place is amazing! It is small, but has a great layout and an open kitchen full of activity. The food was basic and delicious, I had a pasta dish with sausage and herb butter. Simple but prepared well with exceptional quality ingredients that you could taste at first bite.The owner Eliot Wexler sat us and came by to check on us, another example of excellent service.The meal ended with cotton candy, quite a sweet surprise for our first visit. And it rounded out the meal nicely. I was a bit disappointed with the desert menu.. donuts and cookies? I think they could get a bit more creative.  Either way this was truly a 5 star delicious dining experience.Two things really struck me about this place:  the tasting menu portions are HUGE and the restaurant has an extraordinarily convivial, let's-mingle-amongst-foodie-friends atmosphere.  Since we only spent two nights in Phoenix, I did my research and made sure that one day was devoted to the awesomeness that is Chris Bianco and the second night would be at a delicious, more upscale restaurant that takes reservations.  After searching Chowhound and Yelp, we decided on NOCA.  I knew ahead of time that NOCA doesn't normally offer a tasting menu (which is how I like to roll when I am trying out a new place) but on the day we were visiting, there was a special Four Peaks Brewery beer pairing tasting menu.  I'm not a huge fan of beer (plus I'm one of those unfortunate Asians missing that essential enzyme that breaks down alcohol), so I wasn't psyched about the pairing, but I'm super glad I got the tasting menu because there was a whole lot of yummy-ness served up that night.Here's what we had for $85/person:* Amuse of shredded duck salad with tangy Asian vinaigrette* Fluke sashimi with pickled radish, rice crunchies, ponzu gelee (with Sunbru Kolsch Style Ale)* "Bacon and Eggs" pork belly with onion jam, crispy poached organic egg, Blis maple syrup (with Hefeweizen)* Wagyu Pastrami and pickled cabbage and red onion on pumpernickel toast with Dijon foam (with Hop Knot IPA).* Alaskan King salmon with melted baby leeks, asparagus, morels, and Bearnaise sauce (with The Raj India Pale Ale)* Berkshire Pork Loin with mustard spaetzle, carmelized napa cabbage, baby carrots, and smoked shallot jus (with Kiltlifter Scottish-Style Ale)* Big bowl of blue raspberry cotton candy* Oatmeal Stout Float with malted vanilla ice cream, warm doughnuts, and dulce de leche dipping sauce (with Oatmeal stout).Everything was really delicious but super filling.  I swear I reached maximum capacity by the time I ate the Wagyu pastrami (our 3rd course!).  We even had our waiter start giving us just one glass of beer to share because we were just wasting it.  Per our waiter, the portions weren't much smaller than the regular (non-tasting-menu) sizes even though we were eating five meat-heavy courses plus dessert.  I know the Asian in me should have relished the bang-for-the-buck, but I really wish the portions were smaller so I could have savored it more (my genetic make-up renders me unable to leave food on the plate without major guilt).  My faves were the "Bacon and Eggs" - melt in your mouth savory pork belly goodness paired with the subtle sweetness of maple syrup and Wagyu Pastrami.Service was a little harried when we first sat down because the kitchen was slammed by the large number of people unexpectedly ordering the tasting menu but overall, we had a great time.  We spent the evening comparing notes with our neighbors at adjoining tables about which dishes we liked the best and commiserating about how full our bellies were getting.  I left looking like I was pregnant again, no joke.Noca, Noca, Noca...I've been wanting to try you for a while..but with child in tow..I was sceptical about trying you out....do I heart you to death right now? yes! K...so, let's rock the nitty gritty...I ate there a few hours ago and HAD to share... When I walked in, they totally didn't even bat an eye that my daughter(8) was with me...patrons however gave me "the look"...little did they know she was totally in the kitchen later with the chef makin their little cloud of heaven... Ok..so the most phenom wait / bus staff ever! EVER!!!! I applaud you!! If I could have raised a glass to all of you and thought the some what persnickety crowd would follow I would have. But , you know the "Arcadia crowd"... God forbid..they acknowledge where they came from and may be again ...anyway..hat's off to the training and ridiculous management skills you have developed! Like I always tell anyone I have ever dated...it's the small things that count ( d--- exclude) and attention to detail ...NOCA covers it all.... the teeny mad hatter tea cups with soup and the perfect olive oil dipping trays.. I don't heart much these days....serious..check this sh-- out..fo real! If I could put up with the dbag letch next to me for this....you know ..;or please know,..NOCA deserves a visit. The kitchen was a tad slow, but they were slammed all at once..and it's actually nice to have a slow meal, and give each coarse the attention it deserves...they made up for the wait, by bringing Little Tea Cup's of Pea Soup, and Corn Soup, which I snagged from my daughter...then a bowl of tomato gazpacho..(which I couldn't eat, as I am allergic to tomatoes), the waitress did not bat an eye..she whisked it away...and replaced it with an asparagus toasted pine nut salad..yummy! (All of this was complimentary).. I had an Ultimate Vodka Martini..fabu! Nice, Cozy  little 6 seat bar..if the dining room looks crowded, look a little further back to your left and see if you can squeeze in there..good seats and a bird eye view of the crowd.k...so..the lobster ( pronounced) LOBSTAAAAA roll only on Wed. ..I was all trying to be healthy and not eat as a sandwich, at 1st...and it was ok...then I picked it up and had the whole enchilada ....f--- me all the way to heaven and back...you have no idea...I thought about not telling you for like 2 point 4 seconds flat..then decided if you want to have the big "O"..get off your ass and go....just stuff the big ass delight in your face..boss, date, Mom, lookin at you...doesn't matter ..you will thank me later. I have had to cut a lot of food out of my life lately...but NOCA was like ...whatever..bring it on bitch...Thank you for rockin my pallet tonight! The chef...so inventive on every level....the food speaks volumes... but what rocked me was the manager asking my daughter to meet the chef and go in the kitchen to help make the little puffs of heaven .... wait for it....wait for it....home made right then and there-COTTON CANDY! My all time favorite childhood treat. I renamed them Rockin Heaven Puff's last night. They bring them out after your meal....and they'll bring you 2..not that I would know... or anyone else they were gone so fast..I think I licked the bowl...oh geez, do over.NOCA....you are the date I dream about! If yelp had an "O" rating ...you would have it tonight!I've now been twice. Once as a business dinner, once as an intimate dinner. Both times had their good things and their so-so things. The first time I went, they already had 4 things 86'd off the menu at 7pm. And since they had a slimmer, summer menu in place, it made it even narrower of a selection. I did have fresh softshell crab for app that go around with scallops for entree. The scallops were over cooked and the accompanying risotto was under cooked. The most recent dining experience there I had pork belly as app and lamb loin for entree. The pork was delicious and the lamb was good, but the spinach and baby carrot coins that came with were oversalted. Desserts were pretty good both times I went. Of course everyone marvels at the cotton candy as well as the take-home cookie. All and all, if this place didn't price gouge the shit out of you, I'd might come back. But after spending $200 on a mediocre dinner, I am not likely to return on my own accord.So a Redneck walks into a fancy restaurant...We were immediately greeted when we walked into the restaurant and asked if we had reservations...On a Wednesday night...in Phoenix...during the summer...and the restaurant is only half full.  Are you kidding me?  We were promptly seated and briefly waited for a waitress to bring us our menus.  The whole reason we came to Noca was for the lobster roll, so the menus weren't really necessary.  We usually make an annual trip to Maine every summer to visit family but this year, things didn't work out.  So we thought we'd bring a little bit of Maine to us.  Looking at the menu, it was pretty light, but it's summer and I knew what I wanted, so no biggie.Just for grins I started reading through the few things on the menu and about choked on my water when I saw the lobster roll.  $30 for a lobster roll?  This better be one helluva lobster roll for $30.  The best lobster roll in Maine will set you back $6 in a little town called Wells, and the average price back there is $8-12 in any restaurant.  So I read on..."Organic Chicken Egg"...on a biscuit...with a slice of bacon...and a slice of tomato... $15.  At this point, I'm literally laughing out loud.  The waitress returned for our drink order and I was good with the water but my wife ordered a glass of wine.  The waitress later returned and apologized for the fact that they were out of the wine my wife had selected.  So my wife ordered a Riesling and we placed our order.  A few minutes later, another waitress brought us "Tonight's salad...a chopped cucumber and red bell pepper medley".  Okay...You know when you go to a Chinese food restaurant and order a cup of wonton soup and they bring it in that little bowl with the funny lookin' spoon?  Well, the salad was served on one of those funny lookin' spoons.   I kid you not, the "salad" was about a teaspoon full of chopped cucumbers and red bell peppers.  Was it good?  I can't be sure.  I guess I need more than one bite to tell.  While we were enjoying our "salad" a party of four was seated next to us.  This restaurant is another one of those "let's see how many tables we can pack in this place and encroach on everyone's personal space" types.  I swear I've seen cattle in a feed lot with more room to masticate.  The party of four talked it over and ended up ordering a medley of things to share.  One person ordered the lobster roll and the guy sitting next to me ordered...you guessed it...The Chicken Egg!Now I don't know about any of you that might be reading this, but I grew up with livestock.  We raised chickens and every morning I had to gather the eggs.  Now anyone that's ever tried to gather eggs out from under a nesting hen knows it isn't fun.  In fact, it ranks right up there with having to clean out the livestock pens at the county fair as part of your community service.  Thinking back, it probably wasn't a good idea to write "Will you go to the prom with me?" on Jenny Martin's front yard with gasoline when I was in high school.   How was I supposed to know her uncle was the county judge?  Okay, I may or may not have made that part up.  But still, that was the late 80's and I used to sell my eggs for $2 a dozen to different folks around town.  Talk about inflation!So our lobster rolls arrive and we dig in. Now let me just tell you, these lobster rolls were about half the size of an average lobster roll in Maine.  The portion sizes here were really starting to annoy me.   I have to say that I'm not a fan of pommes fries fried in duck fat either.  I guess I'm a purist.  The foursome sitting next to us started to literally, "Oooo and Ahhhh" over our dinner.  So much so, that I almost offered the guy a bite.  But then his chicken egg showed up and I didn't have to...Sucker!After our dinner the waitress brought us the dessert menu.  We looked it over but were pretty full so we decided to pass.  So when she returned with the bill she brought us a bowl with freshly made cotton candy.  Now we're talkin'!  We paid our bill; $80 for 2 lobster rolls, a glass of wine, and a bottle of water and then left.  Who's the sucker again?  Half way out of the parking lot the salad waitress came running out the door and yelled, "Thank you!  Please come again!"  I'm giving Noca 3 out of 5 stars, but it will probably go on my "Been there, done that" list, just because it wasn't my kind of place.   I have to say the food was good, but ridiculously overpriced.  The service was spot on and not overly intrusive.  The only thing that would have made it better for me, and perhaps earned them one more star would have been if they would have given us a bag so we could take our cotton candy home...But then again I don't really need any more reminders of the County Fair.I hope this review came across as more comical and not snarky.  I didn't want it to appear snarky.  Please give the place a try for yourself.  It is very nice.  And by the way, my wife LOVED it!Completely. Totally. Utterly - UN-impressed. I am not going to bother to nit-pick my lame experience through 5 'courses' (yes, 1 of them on a tiny spoon - maybe we took Thumbelina's table).  Salad: "OK"Steak: CHEWY (spat out several pieces - gross, i know)(with hash browns for DINNER?!?!)sourdough bread served with olive Oil (!?!) combined taste = acidicsmurf blue cotton candy  (WTH?!?!)1 star for a yummy dessert - but by then i was pissed off, so it only counts to actually write and insert this reveiw!ended up a pissy nite with us blaming each other who's stupid idea it was to choice to waste our nite (and MOOLA !!) here.What a lovely dinner at NOCA , not only is the food really tasty and fresh but the service is wonderful .  I am overall impressed with the smoothness and finesse of the staff. We noticed that without being intrusive or cloying the staff seemed to notice and respond to our needs. I was amazed how each staff member was responsible for different elements of the serving. One person brought the amuse bouche , a different person refilled water, a different person brought cotton candy ( yes cotton candy, it works) waiter took order and oversaw our dinner, host responded to request , ended meal and smoothly transitioned our exit,  well done . The food was really good , the amuse bouche was.. should we say ...amusing.  so much so that we had to ask again to find our what is was...watermelon and radish "something"..and it worked. We ordered the Tartar which was my favorite for the evening ,  a lovely nibble of handsomely seasoned raw tuna , capers added to the taste with toast rubbed with truffle oil I believe.. super. Salad was the low point, if you can say that , heirloom tomatoes with a light oil and seasoning,  salad with ummm something unremarkable. My entree was a skirt steak very tasty and a potato cake reminiscent of a hash brown but much better.  I had to dodge the spinach ..but husband said it was great. Plus 1 had the Halibut with a yummy sauce that was good yet I could quite place the reddish seasonings..I love a challenge.. he also had rosti potatoes , one of our favorites. Raspberry cotton candy swirled into a light cylinder shape came to our table like a blue  cloud of "ta-da" to finish the meal.  We didn't eat  it but it sure looked pretty. I was fascinated by dessert, a mango thin pudding , with coconut sorbet topped with a thin cracker of hardened meringue ..it looks childish at first, my first thought , I am so going to get Gelato after... but then you eat them spooned together and it's this lovely taste sensation , very delicate and symbiotic.. who would have thought it? I really was impressed if you can't tell. I definitely will be back . Can't wait to try a Sunday Supper!I had been wanting to try NOCA since it opened, and we finally made it to a Simple Sunday Supper recently. We certainly don't mind spending $100+ on a good dinner, but this was not it. Hubby got the vegetarian option- beet manicotti. It was better than he expected it to be, but by comparison to the size of my meal, his portion was quite small. I got the fried chicken and wondered who the hell had named it the best in the valley when I was sitting there wishing I had a plate of Lo-Los'. I thought the breading was way too thick and doughy and didn't care for the marinade. The corn on the cob as well cooked, but nothing special. The potato salad was average at best, and the biscuit was fine. The stand-out was the supplement of pork and beans. The flavor was outstanding, but the beans were a tad al-dente. Hubby didn't particularly care for his wine.Now, I love sweets, but dessert was overkill. The best thing was the cotton candy. Our sundaes were completely soupy, and then we got handed an average chocolate chip shortbread to take home.I found the service to be overkill as well. I mean, I can pour my own beer, for heaven's sake. The wait staff was always hovering. What we didn't get, however, was a visit from the owner, who seemed to stop by every other table in the restaurant. Maybe he could tell we were disappointed, and just didn't want to hear it.I have been wanting to try Noca for quite a while now, so when they had a Groupon a few weeks ago I bought one & decided this would be our Valentine's day date destination. I made reservations for Saturday the 12th at 8:30pm. We were about 15 minuets late, but the hostess was very gracious & seated us immediately. We were sat at a high top table with a chair on 1 side & a booth on the other. There wasn't much going on with the design of the restaurant, but I did like the mirrors across from us & the lighting fixtures. I also liked the faucets in the bathrooms. For starters we ordered the mussels, our server said it was more of a one person dish so we each got our own. They were delicious & he was right, we both finished ours. I ordered the nocarita to sip on & my husband surprisingly opted for a sprite. My cocktail was strong but tasty. Our 1st Amuse Bouche of the night, a bite of what tasted like cucumbers & radish. It was light & refreshing. The server who brought it out did describe it, but it was so loud in there we honestly didn't hear him. Our 2nd was a cute lil teacup of parsnip soup. It was creamy & smooth, I loved it! My hubby wouldn't even try it though, so I gladly had both of ours. I almost forgot to mention the bread & olive oil that came before our app, very basic but very good.About an hour had passed from when we had received our app. I didn't notice the length of time, but my husband made a comment to me about how long we'd been waiting for our entrees. A few minutes later our server came up to us apologizing for the wait. He informed us that dinner was on the house tonight & gave us back our Groupon to use another time. I told him I could see that they were very busy & they didn't have to comp our dinner for us, but he insisted. He then brought out a fresh crab cake of sorts with strawberries & a cilantro drizzle, to nibble on while we waited for our entrees. About 15 minutes later our entrees arrived. My hubby ordered the prime hangar steak & I ordered the striped bass. Both were superb but I think I had the winner. We were already pretty full from all the previously mentioned food we ate, so we took a majority of our entrees to go. I was going to skip dessert since I was already stuffed & I knew we'd be getting some cotton candy, but our server convinced me & I got the doughnuts to go. They were pretty good & I loved the dipping sauces. The cotton candy was a blue-raspberry flavor & my husband loved it, such a fun, sweet end to our meal. Oh & they also handed out tiny shortbread cookies, which were buttery & slightly crunchy, yum! If our meal hadn't been taken care of, the total would have been about $111. Service throughout our meal was outstanding, I don't think our water glasses were ever less than half full. We left our server a tip that was probably more than most would have left, but he was great & it wasn't his fault our meal tickets were misplaced. I can't wait to return with my Groupon for another amazing meal, well done Noca!I had heard very good things about Noca, and was sadly let down.  The food was ok, but very overpriced.  The mussels were tasty, everything else was sub par.  The kicker for the night is we had a question for the manager about our bill and apparently it was a bad day for him and we were practically escorted out of the restaurant.  I dine out several times a week and have never been treated so badly.  Needless to say I will not be heading back to Noca nor recommending to any friends of mine.  What a shame.  I love trying new food in Phoenix and loved the atmosphere, but a bad attitude from management and overpriced food will keep me from coming back.I made my reservation so I could use my groupon before moving out of town... not realizing it was the middle of restaurant week.  This was a minor issue, and will just force a return visit to this fabulous spot (oh darn).  I was a little concerned that restaurant week might not be as stellar as expected, but I honestly can't imagine this meal getting any better.We started with parsnip soup and polenta.  The parsnip soup had a delicious onion undertone, and was quickly slurped up.  The polenta was eaten VERY slowly... so we wouldn't miss a tiny second of savoring the amazingness.  It was THAT good.  The simple topping of crispy capicola and olives, drizzed with olive oil was pure genius.  If it had been an option, I would have forgone the rest of my meal in trade for a large vat of this polenta.   We had the vegetable risotto and salmon with farro next.  The salmon was perfectly done and I really enjoyed the bacon and braised kale that graced the farro.  Our server brought us the standard bowl of cotton candy, which I feel is unnecessarily large.  I mean, I like cotton candy as much as the next person... but about 1/3 of the portion would probably suffice and make the same fun, whimsical statement.  The desserts were next, and were superb.  The brightness of the passion fruit was an amazing ending to an incredible meal.  Our service was impeccable, and I loved the touch of being sent off with a little piece of chocolate-chip shortbread.  Though, sadly, I put the bag in my purse and forgot about it for 2 weeks... I'm not sure if it was any good or not, but the thought was appreciated! This is definitely on my must-recommend list, and I hope I am able to visit again soon.

I am backed up on reviewing, frankly.  So this one is a couple months overdue.  I met fellow Yelper Brian S here for lunch.  I ordered the Gyro plate as I wanted some Greek salad with the meal.  Well the plate deals here are huge.  Two people could probably manage just fine sharing one of the plate meals.  Lots of meat, sauce, fries, salad, dressing.I didn't finish and still I had no room for baklava after.  Sad.The decor is pretty basic.  I would class them as a good lunch spot or cheap dinner joint, not in the "Out for a nice meal" class.

Restaurant name  Curry Leaf Indian Grill
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
It's interesting seeing some of the reviews on here. You would think Curry Leaf was trying to present itself as an upscale Indian food restaurant in a hugely desirable area. Curry Leaf shares a strip mall with a dry cleaners, taco bell, AZ Hair Co and Chuck E Cheese. It's a small place with tables to eat in, but I imagine most of their business is takeout or the newly available delivery. Jeff P mentions "It just sees as if some random Auntie and Uncle decided to lease a space and start cooking fast food versions of Indian food" ... first of all, I disagree with this, and second, isn't America founded on the entrepreneurial spirit that promotes local owned businesses?!? Curry Leaf is owned by a husband/wife duo and I was super stoked at how nice the husband was. He answered my questions without prejudice which is rare for me in other Indian establishments. While I waited for my food, we chatted about their business, my business and other random chit chat. As I was leaving, another gentleman came in and the husband sang out "Hey Bob, how are you doing today?!?" It's nice to see that customer service and appreciation are still alive these days. I ordered the Channa Masala bowl with Basmati Rice and a side of Cumin Potatoes and I was really impressed. The flavor in both dishes was great and had just a little tinge of spicyness. The portions were great and for the price of $4.99 I think an excellent value (Lunch price is $4.99; regularly $6.99). There are also a couple of really neat things that make this place stand out: They offer deliver and TEXT IN service... so you can actually text them your order for pickup! I think that is such a cool idea. You are texting directly to the husbands phone, and then he saves your number so that in the future he knows that its you. I'm pretty sure he remembers every customer. The bowls that they use for takeout are very durable and can be used again as Tupperware. I think this is a super cool idea and adds a little value. In a world where we are cattle prodded through life eating out of Styrofoam containers in our cars, I believe Curry Leaf has made an attempt to add value to their product and I for one am both impressed and inspired and look forward to a new weekly lunch spot!

Review Text :
J Alexanders has come to town....and its like Santa coming! JA coming with all its goodies! I'm a JA regular in Michigan and I've been at the  doors every week like a bad Mervyns commercial!!! Open! Open! Open! (kidding). They finally opened today I'm told more busy than expected.  J Alexanders serves American-style food with a contemporary twist. They fit somewhere between casual and fine dining and the atmosphere is enhanced by dark woods, indoor/outdoor bar and interesting textures.  For Houstons fans, JA has a strikingly similar atmosphere and menu. Legend has it that the original owners of Houstons split and started JA. I personally like the JA menu better. From the colossal onion rings on the appetizer menu to their always classic and perfectly juicy prime rib.  You may see some similarities to Houstons, but don't expect the "famous" Houston's spinach dip. JA's is a queso dip (w/ a little spinach).  As I understand it, they try to tweak their menu to regional markets. If that's so, they have to add more flavor to the queso dip. It was terribly lacking in flavor. Folks in this region expect their Southwest style dishes be full of flavor! Kick it up a notch! One friend had the blue cheese topped filet Mignon and another the pork loin...both very good. The wine list is reliable and pleasing. Many well known labels integrated with some interesting less known. If you're a lemonade lover (Arnold Palmer for DA kid) try their fresh squeezed. Ah! I tell you....they bust their butts for this simple childhood favorite. If you're a carrot cake fan...you've gotta have it! My friends and I sat at the bar to watch some Monday night football and our servers Chris and Brittany were friendly and attentive. Tell them I said "hello"! Bon Appetite!Sorry Natalie - Although I did enjoy the top secret pimiento cheese spread, and of course the company, I thought that my overall experience was only mediocre for the price... I'd been to J. Alexander's before - I think to one of their Michigan locations.  It didn't make a huge impression then, and it didn't this time either.  I think Houston's food, service, and atmosphere actually blow this place away.  Our server was Justin and he did an ok job.  I went with the cobb salad and ordered a side of their butternut squash for the table to share.  Salad was decent and squash was tasty.  Maybe the way to go is to sit at the bar (or so Natalie says).  I don't see returning anytime soon, but I would if someone twisted my arm.  Although the food was decent, I'd rather spend my time and money elsewhere!  Just meh, mediocre, average, etc...Hit up J Alexander's for lunch today... El Toritio next door is closed by the way (not sure if temporarily for construction in the plaza, or for good).Their menu is impressive for lunch! They offered items like a new york strip, club sandwich, chicken fried chicken, sea bass and diver scallops.The place was fairly empty at noon, and reminded me of a well lit Houston's (but here they let you wear your cap).  I imagine it is beautiful at night.Overall good service, food, atmosphere, and price. I'll go back.In the land overloaded with restaurants, sometimes it takes some time to finally make it to one that's been right under your noise the whole time. For me, this is J Alexanders. I probably visit the Borgata area several times a week; whether it's to grocery shop, get a manicure or have a meal. Yet, I never made it to J Alexanders. I always wanted to try it out, just never got the chance -- until tonight that is. It's the midst of spring training season which means every restaurant, including the less than par ones, are packed to the brim with an hour wait. Luckily for us, tonight we got there just before the tourist crowd and got seated right away in a prime table on the patio. Upon first glance at the menu, I saw that it stocked full of cuisine options -- everything from steak to sandwiches to plenty of seafood choices. We started with the Spanish spinach dip and some local brew from Four Peaks. For my entree, I decided to go with the chicken sandwich and couscous on the side. The chicken sandwich tasted exactly like the Biltmore chicken sandwich from Houston's. That's not necessarily a bad thing since I like the sandwich, but it was interesting to taste such a strong resemblance. The couscous was really delicious and they did an excellent job of blending the spices and dressing up what could have been a boring side. All in all, this is a decent recent and a solid choice for a restaurant meal at a decent meal price.Met a colleague for lunch here the other day.  Decided to order the Club Sandwich w/Fries, $11.  He warned me that they don't mess around with their portion size....he was right.  This Sandwich was huge!  In addition to that, it comes with a large pile of skinny Fries.  The Club Sandwich was very good.....and the Fries were outstanding.  I could eat a large plate of those Fries.The service was great as well.  Overall, a pleasant "working" lunch experience.Return Factor - 90%

Review Text :
23 years ago this Memorial Day Weekend I rolled into Las Vegas from residing downtown Chicago. I got tired of the city...all the glass, concrete, steel, sirens, horns, people, people, people, waiting in lines, 20 below zero brutal winters, 100% humid summers, Lake Michigan dumping snow/sleet/hail, etc., etc. But one thing I never got sick of was the restaurants, specifically the pizza category.  Chicago Style Pizza is a unique deep dish pie designed to be eaten with a fork and knife after it bakes a good 30+ minutes.  Worth the wait tonight at Rosati's on N. Durango and Grand Teton.Delicious pizza and Greek salad, friendly service, non-smoking atmosphere, plenty of TVs to watch the games, and large booths...I look forward to dining here again when i'm up in this area of the valley!

Restaurant name  Saffron Indian Cuisine
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
Let me preface this by saying that as an Indian-American, from New Jersey of all places, I have relatively high standards for Indian cuisine. With that said, I would give Saffron's food a 3.5 rating. However, their dreadful service (note other reviews) brings that down to about a 2-star. It is amazing how lousy the service could be even while the restaurant is half-full. I would stick to buffet here, considering even asking for onions/jalapenos (a common complimentary add-on from Indian restaurants) would run you an extra $2-3 dollars. Furthermore, the portions are not quite right from the entrees, so buffet is best:Monday - Friday: $8.95 lunch buffetSaturday: $9.95 lunch buffetSunday: $12.95 lunch buffet (includes beverage)Ultimately, this place works if you are really craving Indian, but I have yet to find a consistently fantastic Indian spot in Charlotte. The search continues!!One time we stopped by here after the movies to grab dinner, but they were having a private party and was only placing take out orders to go.Came for dinner here. The food is just right for me. Not crazy about hot and spicy foods. My stomach is not able to handle that much heat.We order an appetizer- the Potali Samosa. The crust is like a fried Cannoli. Really good with the dipping sauce- Mild which was sweet, Med- Green sauce and Hot-Red which I steer far away from.Entrees consisted of Lamb Saag- Creamy spinach with lamb. Also, Lamb Vindaloo- Little tangy spice. They entrees were prepared mild and was just right.Wash it all down with a glass of Pinot Grigio. What a nice way to end the evening. Great place to take a date on, celebrate anniversary or even a girls night out.Will be back again.

Let's look at the plus column first:Great location near Seventh Street MarketReally cool retro décor with a boldness and "filling station" feel to itDecent pizza that can be ordered by the sliceNow the minus:Took a while for someone to notice me standing at the register$7.50 for two slices was a bit steepThe pizza looked pretty dried out before it was put in the ovenQuite honestly, if Pure Pizza had been open, I would have gone there instead.

mmmmmm Kabob.I enjoyed this place and will go back, perhaps today.  They serve Lebanese style meats with rice and pita.  They've got a great lunch special which comes with 4 different types of meat, rice, salad and pita for like $6.50!  Everything was very tasty and seemed fresh.  My only complaint was some of the meats were a little bland, but not too bad, I just like a LOT of flavor.

First visit was great.  One of the better Italian subs I have had.  Went two more times and portions were scaled back to anorexic levels.First visit the guys behind the counter were super friendly.  Next two times bordering on rude.  Our business had planned to use them exclusively to feed our trainees...not gonna happen.Good location,. good quality ingredients.  Poor value and service.  Put a smile on everyone's face and you can afford to build a better sandwich...more people will come in.  Having a bunch of angry people behind the counter is a killer.Too bad, I really liked this place the first time.

@LBSBURGER at Red Rock Casino #Vegas #nom good!!!With the Saloon style atmosphere and casual dress its a VERY cool Vibe just missing the peanut shells on the floor and the Live band!!My waiter looked like Seth Rogen!! The Service was outstanding-fast & friendly with flair:) The food was Great too. I ordered a Burger and some Potato Twists as you can see from the Photos  it was OUTSTANDING!! One of the BEST tasting burgers I have had and well worth the drive + price tag plus if your up for a challenge they have ONE of the BIGGEST and BADDEST in Town. I had the  STEAKHOUSE BURGER $13.00PEPPERCORN CRUSTED BEEF + GRILLED WILD MUSHROOMSWISS CHEESE + OVEN ROASTED TOMATO + MIX GREENSRED ONION MARMALADE + HORSERADISH-STEAK SAUCE#nom #soGoodWhere do I start?First of all I've waited over a week for LBS Burger to get back to me on this issue to fairly give them to resolve this issue but I have heard nothing.  They have no email on their website and the phone number that they have to reach them is always busy.  I contacted then on facebook and got an acknowledgement that it would be forwarded on, but never heard back.   We wanted to make sure that the issue, a person, was gone so we could maybe come back sometime as regular patrons.  Now I am leaving my honest review of actual events that occurred during our last visit.   I am leaving names out of this review.First of all, our family used to absolutely love this place.  Usually LBS Burger is a place where my family went and we always had good service and food.  However, last time we visited was far from what we expected.We arrived at LBS Burger at 8:35pm to celebrate a special occasion.  We were promptly seated at approximately 8:40pm in the back of the restaurant.  It was a party of 5, with two adults and three children.  Our first encounter with our server - bald young adult with black earlobe rings (who was later identified by the General Manager) was less than pleasant off the bat.  He greeted us with a non-energetic and non-professional and "What's up?" for our drink orders.  We brushed it off.We ordered a water, a diet coke and three root beers for our children.  A few minutes later, our food order was taken.  We proceeded to receive our drinks and eat our appetizers: potato twisters and fried cheese curds.  We had requested extra sauce for the potato twisters but did not receive it.We quickly ran out of drinks and sauce and we tried to get the attention of our server for over 20 minutes.  We pleaded for help from a red haired server who seemed less than interested and then we finally went caught the person from the front desk that seats people when he was seating a new table.Our server continued to ignore us and the desk person which was standing by our table trying to flag him down.  It was blatantly obvious that it was done on purpose.  When we finally got our server back, we again ask for drinks and refills.His response "Alriiight, alriiight, alriiiight" - like we were old friends, but we are not.  He takes the two cups from my children and my wife hands helpfully hands him the third cup. He proceeds to rudely snatch it from her and walk away. Which completely caught  us off guard.  At this point it had been over 30 minutes since we initially needed drinks.I had had enough from this point.  I found the manager to complain and ask for a new server.  While this was happening our server found his way from the back of the restaurant (where the kitchen and our table was) to the front where I was and stared me down and shoved into my shoulder with his shoulder as he walked pass.  Right in front of the manager!The manager sent the server to the back and apologized to me as the server went to the back of the restaurant while I was still at the front.    While the server was walking to the back again he said to my wife and children "F**k you!"My wife decided it was time for us to leave and we did promptly.  Again, the manager was apologetic and gave me his card and told me he was going to take care of the server with HR as soon as he could.  The time on my watch now was 9:30pm - it kind of wasted our night out.The worst part was running back to our vehicle from the restaurant - not knowing where the server was.  We were actually fearing for our lives at this point until we could leave the Casino property.It was very inappropriate with the bad service that we received from the server and the fact that he aggressively snatched a cup from my wife, then proceeded to AGGRESSIVELY TOUCH A CUSTOMER - shove into me with his shoulder while staring me down and then curse at my family at the table.  I tried to contact LBS Burger to follow up and make sure that this employee was dealt with appropriately, but they have been silent.Never again. Ever.Had dinner in Red Rock Resort / Casino / Spa's LBS last night with a couple of my kids. Nice little burger joint in the massive Red Rock compound. They make a pretty darn good burger.After a march around the casino to find a place that'd suit all our (ages) tastes. we settled on LBS Burger. We were seated right away, and asked our drink choices. Lemon mango tea, milk & a Guinness extra stout for me.  Nice variety.I went with Irish nachos to get us going (*mistake) and they had them out to us in a pretty quick fashion.FOOD:Irish Nachos......they were very BIG and tasty and loaded with criss cut fries, sour cream, chives, BACON, melty cheese, jalapeno slices, pico de gallo. 4***StarKids Meal Grilled Cheese (6 yo daughter)... Looked like it was just warmed in the oven...not grilled. Came with a butt load of tasty seasoned shoestring fries. 3**Stars (-1 for not grilled) She ate it all and loved it!Classic Burger (14 yo son)...1/3 lb burger (?)  American cheese, grilled onions, pickles, lettuce, tomato and special sauce. Also came with a boat load of seasoned shoestring fries. He removed pickles and tomatoes but said it was super good. And said the fries with the dipping sauce was great! 4****starshttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/B7XwqO9Lbzq-VtOiRobfCg?select=triIsci1z4mtAzjfYVDHkg#vVCtXnJnqQAW9vQO5KD2kASteakhouse Burger....My burger was effn great. 1/3 lb burger (size was huge?)  cooked to a perfect Med -Rare. With Swiss cheese, Peppered beef patty (could have used more pepper & cheese), super sweet onion marmalade, fou-fou lettuce, roasted tomatoes, mushrooms and a tasty horse radish sauce 4.5**** Stars.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/B7XwqO9Lbzq-VtOiRobfCg?select=triIsci1z4mtAzjfYVDHkg#triIsci1z4mtAzjfYVDHkg*Tip!All the burgers come with a mountain of fries ..... appetizer not necessary.Service:Nice service, checked on us 4-5 times. Clean restaurant!http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/B7XwqO9Lbzq-VtOiRobfCg?select=dfNAd2tlLXoiSara4gdNMQ#Eptk1WZrYWfjWde465kv_wGet a table with chairs because the booths have quicksand seats that are a PITA to get in and out of. And put your food at mid chest level. Neat route 66 kind of decore for the 2012's If in the area I'd go back again.

Review Text :
in honor of the impending superbowl XLV, i wanted to write my majerles review. this year though, instead of hitting up a sports bar for the biggest day in football, i'll be going to a party. a real rager. if i wasn't though, i would definitely be pressed up against majerles front door bright and early superbowl morning. it's a great sports bar.the weirdest thing about majerles is their name. someone finally told me it wasn't pronounced "mah jer lees" like i had thought.... it's pronounced "mar lees". so let me get that out first.i'm a big sports nut.... well, let me rephrase that. i'm a big sports nut when it involves REAL sports. i won't make fun of anyone, but if it's not football, baseball, basketball or hockey i don't wanna hear about it. unless of course we're talking about extreme sports like surfing, skateboarding, etc. being a fan of sports makes me a fan of sports bars. there are only 3 main things i need in order for a sports bar to be great in my opinion. let me lay them out for you:a good selection of beers, happy hour specials and bar snacks--- yes, majerles has this in spades. large selection of beers and any sports bar that has perrier jouet, vueve clicquot and dom champagnes must be praised.(mostly because i think this is absolutely hilarious. WHO orders pricey champers at a sports bar? haha!) also, put me down as a fan of their reuben reuben and tenderloin sliders. yum.the service--- there's nothing worse than sidling up to a bar, excited to watch your team kick some ass and ordering a drink from a bartender that seems bored and unhappy. every bartender i've come in contact with at majerles truly loved being at work (or they at least acted like it). bartenders attitudes really carry a lot more weight then they realize. happy bartender =  happy bar patronsthe strategic placement of large TV sets for comfortable viewing pleasure--- yep. they designed this with real sports fans in mind. no matter where i sit, i can see a multitude of TV's with little blocking my view. so they have it all, and i likey. go here if you're looking for a good bar to watch the superbowl... or any sporting event for that matter. oh, and GO PACK GO!!!

Review Text :
When I rave about my time in Montreal, this is another one of the places that comes to mind. As a former beer judge, naturally I am a fan of Unibroue beer. It was tantalizing to be so close to the brewery in Chambly, but alas we did not have transportation. Luckily for us, Fourquet Fourchette, which celebrates the marriage of gastronomy and beer, has a restaurant in the city, which was fairly easy to find at the Palais des Congrès. The real treat at this restaurant turned out to be the menu itself, and having all of Unibroue's beers on tap was just icing on the cake. I've already mentioned that I am a fan of game meat. Well, the menu itself was full of game, which all sounded delicious (caribou pot pie, for example), I was having a hard enough time deciding what to get. Then our server came around and told us the daily specials, and that just made the decision even harder! The daily quiche was a quiche of game meats; the daily pasta was filled with duck meat and topped with bison jus; the daily seafood was some kind of local fish I can't remember; and the daily meat special was flank steak of horse. That's right, HORSE! I love Canada so much. Anyway, Vince got the horse and I got the duck pasta topped with bison. The horse was super flavorful, I was really glad I was able to try it. I loved my pasta because it was just crammed full of meat and topped with meat juice and more meat; no space wasted on silly things like cheese and sauce. For lunch, it was actually a super good deal, because everything came with a soup and salad bar, dessert and coffee. Of course we also each got a beer sampler, which came with Blanche de Chambly, Raftman, Chambly Noire, Maudite, La Fin du Monde, and Trois Pistoles. It was nice to be able to try the Raftman and Chambly Noire, since I haven't seen these in the US and they were lower in alcohol than the other Unibroue beers. Due to its location, it seems to attract mostly a business lunch crowd from the local office buildings, rather than tourists, though the servers are in traditional costume, evoking "the lost era of New France and its native culture." Our server Serge was amazingly nice and friendly, and was very helpful in suggesting places in Montreal for us to visit. We really appreciated his excellent service as well as all of the delicious food and beer. I highly recommend this place. During the week they are mostly just open for lunch; their hours are Monday to Wednesday: 11:30 to 4:00 p.m., Thursday and Friday: 11:30 to 10 p.m., Saturday: 5:30 to 10 p.m., and closed Sunday. They also have a location in Chambly.

***CUTE WAITER ALERT***I was in Montreal for work this past week and had only free night. My colleague and I decided we were going to head down to Old Montreal. We asked concierge for a restaurant recommendation and she suggested a place off Rue Saint-Paul. I can't remember the name of the place but when we arrived at the location, we learned they were closed for a few days. Darn! But there were a good number of restaurants on that street and after walking a few doors down, we came across and settled on L'Autre Version. The restaurant was fairly quiet on a Wednesday night. Besides the 2 of us, there were only 4 other parties throughout our entire 3 hour meal. Our waiter's name was Jean Claude I believe. I'd describe him as nerdy cute. He was tall, slender, good looking, with nicely-styled hair, black framed glasses and the cutest smile. I could picture him walking a high fashion runway vs. waiting tables. This young 25 year old was somewhat bashful which made him even more adorable. He was definitely nice eye candy for us older, married women. Along with his French accent...super dreamy! Ok, I'm starting to sound like a pervert so I'll move onto the food.The hostess that seated us told us that on Tuesdays and Wednesdays, they offered half-priced bottles on some of their wines. Sweet! We decided on a red wine from France - Julienas Domiane de la Conseillere. It was on the peppery side and very delicious.They were offering a tasting menu which we decided to share. This included a mise en bouche, 4 entrees, and a pastry surprise. You could add the foie gras dish for an additional charge which we did. We also ordered the Charcuterie Platter and Fall Salad. Prior to bringing out the food, they brought us some bread. Besides the usual olive oil & balsamic vinegar mixture and butter, there was salt and apple cider vinegar. You simply dip your bread in the ACV followed by salt. I suppose it's similar to how one eats fish & chips. I wasn't the biggest fan but my colleague loved it.-----*Fall Salad - served w/pears, pecans and shaved parmesan topped with a maple syrup vinaigrette. The salad was light and refreshing.*Charcuterie Platter - there were 4 slices each of Genoa, coppa, speck, and a 4th type which unfortunately I wasn't sure how to pronounce let alone spell. This was accompanied with a side of apple chutney which provided a nice sweet/savory balance.-----"The Good Version Tasting Menu":*The mise en bouche was Lobster Arancini - served with a saffron sauce. I loved the cheesy risotto center and crunchy outer coating.*Salmon Mi-Cuit - half cooked salmon w/horseradish sauce and topped with coriander panko. This was served with a side of greens, pickled onions and a lemony dressing. The texture of the salmon was smooth and buttery...practically melts in your mouth. And I liked the slight crunch from the panko.*Scallops - served with cauliflower purée and king eryngii mushroom. The scallops were cooked to perfection and topped with a caper sauce. The purée was silky and the mushrooms offered a nice bite.*Foie Gras Torchon - served with homemade brioche and a side of greens and golden beets. The piece of foie gras was lightly coated with pistachios. The foie gras was nice and creamy.*Beef Carpaccio - served with arugula pesto, grainy dijonnaise, some type of sprouts, parmesan and capers. The capers seemed to be deep fried adding a unique texture.*Braised Beef Short Rib - braised for 11 hours and served over crispy polenta. The meat was so tender and had just the right amount of fat to give it added flavor. There's nothing worse than dry polenta but that wasn't the case here because the polenta was crispy on the outside and moist on the inside. This was served with a napa cabbage salad and almonds. I loved the added crunch from the almonds and the acidic dressing on the salad helped neutralize any saltiness. We were so full by the time they brought this out and so bummed we weren't able to finish it all.*The pastry surprise was a chocolate mousse. It was decadent but not too sweet. I don't typically care for chocolate desserts but really enjoyed this one.-----Each and every dish was beautifully plated with the chef using food to create his masterpieces. We didn't catch his name but the server that brought out the food did a great job explaining each dish. At the end of our meal, JC asked us which dish was our favorite and we both couldn't say because everything tasted so good. Each dish was complex in flavor and texture. It was obvious that the chef put a lot of thought into making sure each ingredient used complemented one another. This was clearly a meal to remember and there was not one item that fell short of our expectations.**Tip - The restaurant offers free wifi. Just ask for the code. It was tough for us U.S. visitors to be  out-and-about without data so this was very much appreciated.

Red's Bar & Grill=***Red's is a surprisingly good breakfast and lunch spot for a resort hotel***Red's Bar & Grill is the casual restaurant and bar next to the golf course at the Wigwam--a hotel, golf, tennis, and spa resort near Phoenix.  I tend to avoid resort restaurants, but I was at this resort without a car so I gave this resort's casual restaurant a try for breakfast and lunch.I tried them first for lunch.  They recently revamped their menu and it offers a mix of casual and not too expensive gastropub lunchtime fare--hearty starters and a collection of sandwiches including a few burgers.  I started with the bacon and beer cheese dip with pretzel bites.  The warm cheese dip was good as it had a good salty note as well as a smoky flavor from the bacon.  The cheese dip was creamy and had a thickness without being overly heavy or rich.  The dip was topped with green onions, which provided sharpness.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/reds-bar-and-grill-litchfield-park-2?select=UUZHGUneB7XP1Y9v0CWd4A#9w-QtLsLe_BVUhOMchrv1AThe pretzel bites were warm, buttery and not too salty.  They varied in quality though.  Some were too small and kind of hard while others had a nice light and soft quality to them.For my entree, I had the Southern Bird, which was a satisfying turkey burger.  What made the turkey burger shine the most were the garnishes.  The lettuce and tomato were both fresh.  I also enjoyed the lightly sweet but also slightly spicy BBQ sauce.  The fried pickles provided an indulgent crunch and fried component to the burger as well as a little bit of tanginess from the pickles.  There was also melted cheese though I do not think cheese always works with turkey burgers.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/reds-bar-and-grill-litchfield-park-2?select=UUZHGUneB7XP1Y9v0CWd4A#80b_lNUkJCOLHODY-2r8oAThe turkey patty itself was slightly moist though definitely not as moist as an expertly prepared medium rare burger patty.  The turkey patty though had a good amount of flavor due to the aggressive seasoning of it.  The burger sat on a fresh whole wheat bun.  The bun provided a sturdy structure for the burger and all of the toppings so it could be eaten as a sandwich and not something with a knife and fork.The burger came with fries and they were excellent--hot and crisp on the outside but still soft on the inside.Dessert was disappointing.  I had dessert flautas, which were fried pastries filled with brownies, nuts and marshmallows.  The flautas were paired with vanilla ice cream and whipped cream.  The brownie flavor was decent and it was nice to have a warm dessert.  This was supposed to a rocky road-like experience, but the flavor of the nuts and marshmallow were not really there.  In addition, the flauta pastry was not crispy enough (it was actually quite soft and almost burrito tortilla-like).I also tried Red's for breakfast and had their Southwest Loco Moco, which was Sonoran rice mixed with chorizo and ranchero sauce.  The rice mixture was topped with poached eggs, cotija cheese and sour cream.  The flavors were all delicious.  The poached eggs were nicely done so that the yolk provided a thick and creamy sauce for the dish.  The chorizo was moist and meaty.  The rice was cooked to the right texture and all of the sauces and creams and chorizo combined to provide a spicy and savory breakfast dish.There were a few areas where it could have been better though.  The dish was very soft.  Loco moco is too, but I think I would have preferred some crispy and crunchy textures here to provide variety to the hearty and comforting dish.  In addition, the temperature was a little uneven as some elements were hot while other ingredients (like parts of the rice) were lukewarm to even slightly cold.The dining room at Red's works.  It is comfortable and suitable for various party sizes.  It is also casual while still having a slightly upscale feel making it a good contemporary gastropub option.  If you sit outside, you get nice views of the golf course.I found the service to be very personable and friendly.  I also felt the food came out at a quick pace.  The waitstaff did not check in as much as other places I have been to and I think this was due to the shortage of staff.  I did not think it impacted the experience that much though I did witness one very unhappy couple who seemed to have longer than expected wait times for food and service.Prices were reasonable.  Portions are generous and you do not have to pay the ridiculous prices that you often have to pay at a resort or even just a hotel for that matter.Overall, I liked Red's.  The food would not compete against top gastropubs I have been to across the country.  But for the area, I felt the flavors and quality of their food would probably be above most of their nearby competition.  If you are staying at this resort or playing golf, I think Red's is a satisfying option for breakfast or lunch.I believe free parking is available.
Restaurant El Meson=Two pitchers of sangria later, I approve.Seriously though, this is clearly a family run joint where the father is in the kitchen and the children are working the front of house. That, plus food which was far more authentic than I expected (umm, cactus garnish?) makes for a small business that really deserves to be rated favorably. Was everything a home run? No, not really... but it was still better than every other Americanized Mexican joint I've been to in the States. Whatever you are doing Restaurant El Meson, please don't stop. Merci.
Crystal On Penn=No.  No.  A thousand times no.  Guy Fieri owes me 30 bucks and the hour I completely wasted on one of the worst dining experiences I've had in years.  (Yeah, yeah.)First of all, this place is a hole.  I don't mind holes as a general rule, but Crystal on Penn takes  it to a "hole" new level.  It's Dante's circle of hell reserved for compulsive cleaners, fans of sanitation and neat freaks.  It's dirrrrrrty, know'm'sayin'?Second, the service.  It's bizarre.  Servers who holler across the bar at each other and patrons and sing along to the radio at the top of their lungs.  Friendly, but not professional in the slightest.Lastly, the food.  It's awful, and about as "Mediterranean" as raggae.  The sampler appetizer was described to us by the server as "a sampling of all our best appetizers, accompanied by fresh, warm pita."  Dolmades were dry and bland, hummus was boring, tabbouleh was all parsley and the olives were canned California olives.  "Fresh" and "warm" translated to "chewy" and "room temp" for the pita.  Icing on the cake: the plastic, divided server like the pre-cut veggie platters at the grocery store.The falafel sandwich -- touted by our server as featured by Guy on "Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives" -- had an extremely odd aftertaste and was served as crumbles instead of patties.  Husband's gyro salad was completely uninspired, sprinkled with griddled flakes of lamb gyro.  Griddling the gyro meat rendered it crunchy.  Most of each meal was left behind on the plate.Just.  No.[15 Minutes of Fame: "Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives: A Taste of Everywhere"]
Decarie Hot Dog=Decarie Hot Dog is a Montreal institution. If you have a craving for comfort food... this is the place to go.... AAAAAND it's always open.The esthetic of the place and neighborhood look somewhat shady as well as dirty but it can be worth your time to quickly come here to eat anyways. The place is literally this tiny hole in the wall, easy to miss with very limited seating and it can get pretty busy.I've been here many times in my life without issues to have their "Lafleur" steamies. Hot Dog Decarie prepares them quickly and so dirt cheap you can easily buy more. And why not??? These dogs go down nicely and are delish!My favorite though is their popular poutine. It's a 'notch below excellent' and is unlike many places that do serve poutine, it's consistently as good each visit. Huge portion, the fries are just right, generous with the extra squeaky cheese curds and the gravy goodness is damn solid folks. All for a mere $5. Best deal in the city as far as I know.For a mere 10 bucks you'll leave this place with a full HAPPY stomach. What's not to like?
Bentley's on 27=Great view. (insert sounds of crickets chirping here) But that's about it. Bentley's really didn't impress me the other night. When we got there- the hostess asked us to take a seat in the bar as our table wasn't ready. Okay. So we sit in the stylish bar in front of the fireplace and a woman comes over to take our drink order. At that point the hostess came and got us for the table and the server basically never got us our drinks. In most fine dining restaurants- once the drink order is taken, it doesn't matter if you drink them in the bar or the restaurant; they take them to where you are. But not the case here. So we never got that first drink. That was the first service mis step of the night. The rest of the service errors were due to the server who we had (or didn't have, as the case may be, as this guy was missing in action for most of our VERY long dinner). We were celebrating a birthday and had asked for a window table for this occasion. We were seated in the perfect table- right on the edge of the window looking out over downtown Charlotte. This was off to be a great night. Or so I thought. Our server came over with a couple of bottles of champagne to tempt us but we were in the wine and cocktail mood so we passed on the champagne. Maybe that was our mistake as this guy didn't come back to our table to get our drink order for at least 15 minutes. No drinks. No bread refresh. No fresh ground pepper (other tables had it) No service. Where is all this "southern hospitality" that my friends down here talk to me about? Not at Bentley's on this Thursday night, that's for sure. We placed our order. Too bad for me that they didn't have Grouper on this night although it was printed on the menu (my fav) but had instead substituted Mahi Mahi in for it. No thanks. I went with surf and turf with a filet and crab along with a salad to start. My friend ordered escargot to start and this same server tried to talk him out of it saying it would take 20 minutes to prepare. " Hey!", thought I. "The man wants snails . . .give him snails!" Don't try to talk him out of it. So the rest of our appetizers came up with the snails and were quite good. There might have been a pacing problem in the kitchen as our entrees then took forever to come out. And when they did, other than the sides coming out piece meal, the food was pretty good- although there was gravy over my filet when I had ordered it with Bearnaise sauce. Also-there were only 2 melted butters brought out to the table- when clearly 3 of us were having lobster or crab. At this point- our dinner was going on the 2.5 hour point and we were meeting others and had to go. However- we knew there was a special birthday dessert coming out but again . . .it was taking forever. When it finally came out, we had a forkful and then practically ran out of the door. Dinner for 4 ran about $400 which would have been reasonable for a fine dining restaurant, had we gotten a fine dining experience. An off night? I don't know. This server really blew it. And at that price? I am sure there are better choices in Charlotte.One undeniable fact about Bentley's is of course, the the grand view and ambiance. If you get seated next to the window (and please ask for a window seat), you won' t be disappointed. They will seat next to each other to be romanced by Uptown's mesmorizing skyline. When we get to the food and service though, slightly unimpressive.The Valentines day experience had the prefix dinner and a classy lounge band singing some classic slow dance tunes that all age groups would appreciate. When we get down to food and service, I can't really say I was courted ever so eloquently. While the food and service was A-okay, truth be told, they really aren't up to par in comparison to the prime real estate.Went here on date-night, and the place was oh so romantic. I give the food 3-stars, but the ambiance deserves a star all on its own. What can I say, I like my food messy and ethnic. Bentley's food is pretty and rich. We ordered the crabcake for appetizers, I ordered the Taste of Hawaii, which was fresh sea bass that night, and my man ordered a steak. The presentation was lovely, and the service was superb. Think Anthony Hopkins in Remains of the Day. We had the best view in the house in my opinion, facing the city skyline. We got there at 8 p.m. and by the middle of our dinner, we saw the sun set.
The Kitchin=Michelin one star?  Me thinks not.Any star from the Michelin Guide denotes a restaurant that delivers an unparalleled dining experience.  From the sophistication of the food, its presentation, setting and service.  All should be near flawless and representative of the culture.The Kitchin prides itself on outstanding sourcing of ingredients but combined in a way that makes none stand out.  Perhaps it is the intended goal, but having tried numerous "regular" eateries in Scotland prior to the Michelin meal, I never experienced blended flavors.  Don't get me wrong, the food is plenty good just uncharacteristic of a restaurants so dedicated to ingredients. The meal opens with an assortment of crisp flat bread wafers with a creamy bleu cheese dip.  Some with laver, others with squid ink.  A fun opening act.The prestarter, a small serving of seafood veloute with raw root veg and bright acidity ready's the palate for more.To the starters.  Gigas oysters prepared six ways.  Raw, outstanding and showcasing the incredible clean flavor.  Cooked as a Rockefeller, smoked, cut up and mixed with root veg, in a Asian sauce, etc were good on their own but the subtle goodness of the oyster is lost.  A hand dived Orkney scallop baked in shell with white wine, vermouth and a wild herb, butter sauce, vibrant and sweet.  Steaming keeps the scallop tender.  Somewhat over seasoned.For mains, a very good monkfish tail wrapped in pancetta, served with barely cooked through squid, pan roasted potatoes, foraged mushrooms and scallion with a seaweed sauce.  The Scottish affinity for pairing mushrooms with Seafood continues to impress in its ability to bring out the natural flavors.  The only weakness, the pancetta overpowers the delicate fish.The lobster stuffed with squid, pancetta, assorted squash and braised fennel, and finished with an escargot butter, outstanding.  Incredible sweetness harmonizes perfectly with the anise flavor of the fennel.  The escargot butter's richness and slight earthiness adds incredible back flavors and surprising umame.  Incredible. The only true mistake, the lobster "risotto".  Sweet, perfectly cooked lobster claw and tail served in a "risotto" of potato in a VERY salty seafood broth.  Impossible to eat.  Dish sent back and a replacement, simple, off the menu lobster dish replaced it.A richly flavored pistachio soufflé with chocolate ganache and chocolate chip ice cream, whisky, and petit  fours rounds out the meal.Service; German efficiency.  Never slowing, never stopping.  Friendly but not providing the relaxed atmosphere one expects for a 3 hour meal.The wine list is good but lacks in vintage depth.  Prices are very fair with the average bottle price £100.Overall, reasonable, with dinner for three inclusive of drinks and service, £490.Three month advance booking required.  Credit card to warranty reservation.Somewhat disappointed by the hype.  Eclipsed by the chef's other Michelin eatery, Castle Terrace.
Nogales Hot Dogs=Hit this place originally after reading Eliot Wexler's review in Edible Phoenix. If Eliot likes something, odds are that I'm going to follow right along. Was definitely the case.Was driving by tonight at 1:00 am & just had to stop again. Quick hit for a hot dog with everything - bacon, mayo, beans, tomatoes and onions on a soft bun/roll.  Piled on my condiments of choice, canned mushrooms - lots of them (just got to love the canned mushrooms), guacamole, cheddar, cotija & salsa. Powered down while there, including retopping the dog countless times with my falling condiments. So yummy.Just a great end to a great night.Camelback rd. has established itself as the avenue for gourmet burgers.  Indian School is laying claim to the hot dog.  Between Nogales, Maui Dogs, the regular visits from Short Leash and now Joeys of Chicago, Indian School is fast becoming the defacto hot dog mecca for locals.While not quite as good as the Sonoran dogs in Tucson or even Mexico, this place more than sufficiently satisfies your cravings.  And the fact that it is cash only and in a shady parking lot only heightens the 'South of the Border' like adventure.I've been past this place many nights on my trip between central phoenix and downtown scottsdale, I've heard of the delights to be had, I've desired the bacon wrapping, but I've never actually stopped. That is until now. All the stars aligned this night. I had a hankering for something tasty, I was driving past, it was after everything else closed already - well except for taco bell, but who reall WANTS to eat at taco bell? We ordered up two dogs with all the toppings - well, everything but onions and tomato for me. As exciting as this moment was for me, I couldn't help but compare them to my favorite dog - (ShortLeash). I really think it's unfair to compare everyone to them, but you just can't help it. Pre-short leash this spot may have had high ratings in my book, but I left still hungry after an a-ok dog thinking that next time, I'll just stop at taco bell :-/All in all - not a terrible hot dog, but nothing about it made me want to "write home about it" with exception of their late night hours.Happy Yelping Phoenix!"I've been around this block twice now. Looking for something. A clue. I've been looking for clues and something led me back here. Yeah. So here I am. It could have been me, the one who was at Ringo's place when the shit went down. Hey. I know how it is. I've been there. We've all done bad things. We've all had those guilty feelings in our heart. I'm going to take your brain out of your head and wash it and scrub it and make it clean. I don't know. But I'm going to have to settle this. First we're going to check the grill and see what we can find. We're going to get nice and wet, and you're going to spread your buns. Oh, that's good. So you know me. You know my reputation. Thirteen inches of tough load, I don't treat you gently. That's right. I'm Brock Landers. So I'm going to be nice. So I'm going to be nice. So I'm going to be nice, I'm going to ask you one more time. Where the fuck is Ringo?" Dirk: stands up and looks directly at a massive delicious sonoran dog wrapped in bacon with tomatillo salsa, cotija cheese, creamy guacamole, pico, and mustard. You are a star. You are star, You are a star, You are a star. You are a big, bright, shining star. That's right. "Look, I'm just a Philly guy from out of town that was in town for business for a few days, and happened to have a friend in Phoenix who wanted to show me the best of Phoenix street food.  I'm not one to say no to that proposition.  And I don't know if these Mexican style hot dogs are better than the ones you get in LA or anything like that.  I'm not that savvy when it comes to this style.  But what I will say is this... after trying one of these with guacamole, cheese, and salsa, I wanted to immediately eat two more.  You know what really sold it to me?  The roll.  I've never had such a soft hot dog roll in my life.  And even though it was so soft, it held together like a champ with all of those ingredients on it.  The ladies told me that they get them from a local bakery.  Kudos to that bakery, whomever that is.  I was considering naming this the best hot dog I've ever had after eating it.  Today, I'm not going to be that extreme.  But it's right up there with my favorite places, and it will be a repeat destination for me if I'm ever back in town.Stealing a line from my escort we dined with great fanfare. Where? Venice. Right on the canals. A hotdog after some late night shenanigans hits the spot. These are wonderful hotdogs, perfectly cooked and served on a unique bun. (Uno momento to describe.)I ate two of them.They are works of beauty when delivered to your table. Located outside under a tent in a parking lot a person might just drive by. Very casual. Slow down in your excitement. Your belly will be happy. This food truck offers table service. I found this incredibly charming. Take a seat and someone will be out to offer options.I'm not quite sure which options I inhaled. Like i said, late night, and I hoovered two. Delicious. Bacon, mayo, jalapeños, salsa, beans, maybe some pico? Then I squirted two different green spicy sauces on top. Oh! And sprinkled cheese. (Cheese makes everything better!)The bun is not a potato bun. It was flaky, sweet and buttery. The bun could readily be eaten alone. Slightly warmed with a hint of butter and you'd be ready to go.I'm told Nogales is looking to open a Sushi location *next* door in the near future. Very exciting news. The night we visited I had the good fortune to meet Juan, the owner. Nicest man ever!Please note: Cash only.Yet another to cross off my list of items to try as a new transplant to Arizona. From the bombardment of grilled dogs wafting through the air driving home late at night, Travel Channel airings of the best of Arizona and Instagram drunchie pics- why the hell not?Made it out to Nogales with Kay T. after a Yelp event in the Central Phoenix/Biltmore area and was looking for something substantial to curb our hunger at a late time. Had Nogales on my bookmarks for quite some time and decided to head here.I ordered the Sonoran hotdog that you get here and went topping crazy, when in Rome? Exactly. The hotdog is topped with beans, quac, tomatoes, onion, mayo and I went ahead and topped it with shredded cheese, mushrooms, queso cotija and gave myself a side of pickled jalapeno. Also they had Cerritos, so you know a girl had to grab one ... ended up with the Mandarin one.The bun was so soft and fluffy, wish it was kind of bigger to hold all the toppings and the hot dog. The hot dog was typical- I didn't get a bacon wrapped one, but it was the toppings that took it to the next level. It's pretty much a hot dog with a regional flair! Did I love it? Not as much as I would have thought I would, I guess it left a lot more to be desired. However, that's another thing I got to cross off my list of things to try!They accept cash and card at the cart.
Ethel's Lounge=I'd skip it.I mean, it's okay and they are said to have the best antojitos in the city but the place is too dirty for me and no matter how often I have stopped in, I've always preferred the other bars along King St. to this one. They have a big dark patio in their parking lot, and the inside is small and grungy at best. I feel like a bit of a jerk giving this place a bad review after all these great ones but for me, this bar just isn't my thing.
Ping Pong Thai Restaurant=via textChum: Hey, I'm arriving here at one, dinner? drinks? both?Me: Both7 pmChum: Where the hell are you?Me: DowntownChum: Meet us at Ping Pong on SunsetDidn't get a chance to Yelp it, but Chum and his pals liked it so I met up with them.  The place was empty except for a couple.  It was strange...they sat us in the booth right next to them.  Trixie and Antonio come here often and love it.  They also commented that every time they are here, the place is empty.  I asked what about lunch, and they said it's the same.  So a red flag went up and I now wondered if it was any good.  But then again, Chum has dated an assortment of Asian girls so maybe he had better take on this place than I gave him credit for even if he's a vegetarian.I ordered my standard Panang curry with chicken.  Here is where it was a little strange.  This was the first time, I've ordered Thai food with people who didn't opt to share everything.  So I couldn't try Trixie's Pad Thai, although I'm sure she would have if I asked, but I had just met them, so I felt kinda weird.  My dish was very good with just the right amount of heat...I ordered it spicy #2.  I also ordered a Singha beer as well.  Price wasn't so bad...$53 for the four of us.  The portions were generous too.Overall, it was a pleasant dining experience.  We thought that maybe this was a cover for some money laundering thing.  And what's up with the name?  Is ping pong even Thai in origin?  The staff was very nice.  I thought it was funny that the rice took a while to come out.  So I'm not sure if my review is accurate based on one dish.  But it is my favorite and it was very tasty.  I would definitely come back and try more the next time I'm in the area.  I'm in an internet cafe because the wifi is whack at my hotel.If I can tell any of you dear readers two things it is this...people who wear black robes are extremely picky about when you show up...and if you meet one in an alley way behind a bar in Tuscon they will charge 20 dollars extra for things that should be included.That being said my Southwest tour of *******(removed for legal reasons)****has taken my down a long and winding path. So, I am getting ready to see the ****** again and before it was time to go to ***** my ****** said that we need to eat before the **** bargain was going to be announced.I agreed under few conditions...it had to be Thai food and it had to be Thai food on a nice sounding street...AND the restaurant had to have a really stupid name....here comes Ping Pong on East Sunset.  Ping Pong...I did a lot of that while ****** in that horrible ****** and and dreamed about it when i spent 8 months in the hole.  Okay, I can do this. Let's go.  So we went in and I have to say, and it isn't because i have spent most of my life in ****** facilities...but the girls who work as waitresses are all very nice looking. Good beginning.One of these sweet young things sits us down at a table, gives us menus and tells us she will be right back.  I think she will make a great wife number 7.  The lunch menu was complete with all of the standard favorites: pad thai, yellow curry, hot and sour soup, etc. With the pad thai, yellow curry and other dishes you can chose your own meat.After ordering we get a complementary bowl of soup, which was very good. Great coconut milk flavor.  A few minutes later the food came. Very good portion size, and the quality of the food wasn't exceptional but it was good.  For example, I picked the chicken as my meat with the yellow curry and I found two pieces of gristle that should have been cut away before cooking.Another complaint is that I was asked how hot I wanted it, and I like my food spicy so I told her that. Not only was it not that spicy, but all they did was added red pepper flakes as far as I could tell. The broth of the curry was not spicy unless I directly ate a red pepper flake. So it appears to me they do what most places who serve the Anglo's do...they make it mild and they use a cheap way to make it hotter. I am Rex Marvin...I can TELL when you do that.Which is a shame that their prep work was sloppy and their food made too pedestrian for the masses. The other techniques they used were great. The vegetables were cleaned and cut well, they had been properly marinated in the stews and soup, and they took on a great flavor. The hot chicks in great outfits were nice. The portions were good. The price was right.Unfortunately this is the case of exotic cuisine being Americanized to a point of losing what makes it really special.I tried explaining that to the chef, but I am not sure he could understand me with all the screaming and my **** pulling at me and sobbing about all his hard work down the drain. I like to think the chef understood...but all I saw was fear...all I heard was madness. Hope he was able to wash those friggin red pepper flakes out of his eyes by now.From now on if I want Thai's I am either going to this great hooker I know who also does this bead trick that is out of this world...or maybe Archi's. Sure, I had to alley whip some punk last time i was there, and I am banned, but who is going to stop me? I am Rex Marvin. You are not.3 1/2 stars. Brought some clients in for lunch since they picked Ping Pong Thai. This was my first visit here and we arrived before the lunch hour which was a blessing BC it gets busy after the noon hour.Started off with a Thai Ice Tea - large and refreshing. I went with the soft tofu Pad Se Ew and requested no broccoli. The food arrived promptly although they included broccoli! I blew it off and didn't make a stink about it but even my client mentioned he heard my request. The dish was still tasty and filling so I  was content.This is my clients go to place since it's near their office so I'll return again here and give em another try.For years I have driven past Ping Pong Thai always thinking it was an adult themed Thai restaurant with ping pong shows. No shows here. They only have food. Not even one ping pong ball:(I've tried the Panang and found it to be watery and bland. The Pad Kee Maw is consistently delicious and packs enough spice I am satisfied ordering it at Medium heat. This dish is the only reason I come here. It's certainly not for the service. The service is slow when dining in and good luck chasing down a refill. To Go orders are the exact opposite. Either way you choose you are still left feeling like a number. Boy do they pack the herd in at lunch.If only they had a Ping pong table I would gladly raise the star level. Maybe the owner is a ping pong champion from Thailand. Now that would be something to get excited about.IT's CALLED ATTITUDECame here on a Saturday afternoon for a rendezvous with some friends. Place was pretty much to ourselves. We accidentally spilled a little bit of our Thai iced tea and mopped up the table with several paper napkins. The only waitress saw it and allowed us to police our table. Asked repeatedly for napkin replenishment. It fell on deaf ears. Finally she drops off the napkins while serving our lunch. Finished our lunch which was most satisfying, she bussed our table and then slips away into the kitchen abyss. Spent in excess of $50 for lunch. She didn't bother coming out from the kitchen as we left saying good bye in Thai. Assume her presence in the kitchen took a higher priority.Thai people are renown for their friendliness... just not here. Oh well, there are so many other excellent Thai restaurants to be discovered.We came here on a Saturday evening and ordered 1. Pad see ew, chicken - 10.952. Panang curry, beef- 10.95 for 26- Unpleasant welcome. Sticky door. Unfriendly greeting, but seated right away. - 2 girls helped us. Direct service. No congeniality. Want drinks? Order now? Here's food. More Water? Check. Boring! I get more conversation and friendliness at a McDonald's drive-thru.- Presentation is poor. Looks like something that was poured on a buffet line. - Pad see ew noodle was cut short. no chinese broccoli. flavoring was very good. portion was small. - Panang curry was great. veggies and beef slices were good. good portion of curry but poor serving of rice. not balanced.- Self serve to-go. - No bye.- Best received to-go but don't dine in.Conveniently located (for me) on Sunset next to the park, a few miles from my office.  Solid 3.5 to 4 stars for their lunch specials menu.  I've eaten lunch at Ping Pong many times over the last 5 years, but I have never ventured off the lunch menu. Service has always been fast and friendly at this family run Thai restaurant and the food has been served hot and fresh.  The spiciness scale here is 1-4, and I find that a 3 is hot enough for me.  I've tried a bunch of the lunch specials, but always come back to the my go-to's, which are Pad Thai, Basil Chicken, and Pad Kee Maw.The lunch special comes with the soup of the day or salad and non-noodle dishes are accompanied by steamed rice.  You can substitute fried or brown rice for $1.00.  Coke products are $2.50.Not surprisingly, I ordered the $6.95 Basil Chicken lunch special on my last visit, with steamed rice.  It was delicious, per usual.  The veggies were crunchy, the chicken spicy and flavorful, and the rice helped cool down the spice when I needed it.My friend ordered the $6.95 Chicken Chow Mein lunch special and enjoyed it thoroughly.  She said she would definitely get it again.Lunch Specials are available M-F 11-4, and S-S 12-4.I've been here a bunch of times. The food is always good, the service is always great.
Ocean Buffet=I don't know if I hit Ocean on an off night or what but I won't be back after my one experience here.I'm not a fan of this style of restaurant to begin with and I found the food to vary from average to poor.I've never had what I would consider good food at a Chinese buffet and have not eaten at one for years.  It will likely be years before I try one again.
Fresh Buffet=@LasVegasHilton Weekend Brunch is $17.99 per person. Serving crab legs,prime rib a full breakfast and more.They have made to order eggs, steak,bbq ribs,fried chicken, lox,bagels and cream cheese plus they have lots of donuts,rolls and pastries.Service is good, line moves real quick so real wait plus the sportsbook is right there so you can watch the game while you wait in line.For under $20 for a weekend brunch a pretty good deal and the food is really good so it's well worth it!!After a long day walking the convention floor at CES, a few friends and I decided to have dinner here at The Buffet.  I've been here several times and have my favorite dishes.  This evening, I opted for Pizza, Macaroni & Cheese, Fried Chicken, Hot Link Sausage, and for dessert a Slice of Blueberry Pie.The food is pretty good.  My favorite is the Fried Chicken and Mac n Cheese.  The Chicken has a nice, crispy & flaky skin to it with the white meat tender and juicy in the inside.  The Mac n Cheese is thick and gooey....nom nom!Since it was dinner, they had the small bar open, so I had some Oktoberfest Beer to wash it all down....this was complimentary, bonus!Overall, we had a good dinner with great service.Will I return?  Sure.Definitely not the best buffet in Vegas, but when you don't really have any other places to go..it'll do. Options are alright..I did like the grilled veggies, but unfortunately they tasted like crapola. They had an omelette bar in the morning, and then pasta at night. The pasta was bleck. Mine wasn't made all the way through, and it was still warm. I got a bad tummy ache later on that night.The ice cream machine served delicious ice cream though. With some crumbled up butterfinger on the side. YUM.Having low expectations about this place, it actually allowed this place to exceed expectations.Staying at LVH, we got complementary coupons to try the buffet.  Knowing we were going to pay for a big dinner, we wanted to grab a small snack beforehand.  Sure, a buffet isn't quite a snack, but I wasn't expecting to eat much, and since it was complementary, the whole "eating what I paid for" concept that usually happens at most buffets didn't apply here.But the food was actually quite tasty.  They're currently having their FESTIVAL ITALIANO.  I tried a few items.  A couple of their pasta dishes, some meat from their freshly sliced section.  They even have a made to order pasta station if you want to be so bold as to create your own pasta dish.I was a little bummed we couldn't have any of the complementary beer and wine.  Apparently that is only for the weekends.Overall, a pretty decent buffet if you're staying at the LVH.
The Original Pancake House=OMG! This place is delicious! IHOP who?! The buttermilk pancakes are out of this world! The homemade syrup is as well. A short stack is three pancakes and a full stack is six pancakes. A short stack is more than enough for the average person.They give you a huge portion of corn beef harsh. It's pretty good but, not as good as Pamela's.Their fresh squeezed orange juice is something special as well but at $4 a glass is pretty steep. I can buy a whole bottle of Simply Orange for that!My wife had a Reuben and a cup of Wedding Soup. The Wedding Soup was the best we have ever had but it had no noodles. Huh?A must try place! Get there early as they close at 3 pm.
Oscar's Pier 83=They now offer all u can eat but watch the times. It is something like Mon-Sat 3-5 and 7-9 and all day Sunday. If you have not been here yet. Check it out. There is something for everyone here. Today we had the 3 piece with Fry's and slaw, but since the pieces were small he gave us #4. That was really cool. Everything was cooked perfectly and we had a great lunch.Dang. Duh -HAng This is goo foo! My mom is deathly allergic to shellfish. That, and I grew up in a desert for 10 of my formative years. When I think of shellfish, I think of slightly forbidden, delicious little delicacies. While growing up the idea of lobster and crab was the ultimate indulgence in haught cuisine, it seemed. . The only time my Mom liked fish is when it didn't taste like fish. "I like swordfish because it's not fishy", or "ooh orange roughy is so good! It's not fishy at all". I wanted fishy fish. I wanted something that tasted like the ocean. I wanted to see why lobster and crab was so expensive. In more selfish and morbid moments I hoped a chef would accidentally drop a shrimp into her food so she would die, and I could eat all the seafood I wanted. There's no lobster at Oscar's Pier 83, but you can get things here that are really rare in Arizona, and plenty of it is exquisitely fishy, in the freshest way imaginable. I did takeout and I ordered a lot of food: Oscar's Ultimate Combo (1 Jumbo Shrimp, 1 Jumbo Sea Scallop, 1 Oyster, 1 House Fish, 1 Chicken Strip, 1/4 pound Fried Clam Strips, Fries, Cole Slaw) THEN Fried Soft-shell Crab Crab cake Clam Chowder It was all at least 4 stars. The Exquisite: The Fried Oyster- My god this was good. Keep in mind I told you I like fishy fish, but this thing was fresh, juicy, full of meat, and perfectly matched my seafood craving. I thought it was a scallop at first, which is one of my favorite things on earth- but it was so much better than any scallop I've ever had. The Fried Soft Shell Crab- This was served with a pink remoulade like sauce that was divine. This thing was meaty, a little salted, and perfectly flavored. The remoulade was excellent. The Crab cake- It had a ton of crab in it. The only one I've had that was better was in Maryland overlooking the water. Dipped in the remoulade this more than just good. The Clam Chowder- It spilled in the car, in the bag, so I brought it in and ate the chowder with a spoon out of the bag. It was that good. The Very Good- The House Fish- Really good. Probably the best I've had. What's weird is that I think the excellence of the oyster and soft shell crab overshadowed this. Had I had this on it's own I'd probably be raving about it. It wasn't fishy at all. The Scallop- It was a little dry and bland. Very big however. The Shrimp- Better than a lot of shrimp I've had in Arizona- but not the best I've ever had. The Chicken Strip- Had I been more present at the time of ordering I would have tried to substitute this for something else. When I go again, I will order the soft shell crab, 3 oysters, and some clam chowder. Maybe I'll bring in my mom and Oscar will be the one to finally do her in with a stray piece of shrimp (DEVIL LAUGH). I kid, I kid.When people feel a cold coming, they pop a zinc lozenge or tablet to boost the immune system. I have a much better way to get my zinc supplementation: I head over to Pier 83 for their terrific fried oysters. With the first crunchy bite I begin to feel so much better. Placebo effect, probably. But hey ... as long as I get that feel-good boost, I don't care. The fish and chips are also the best I've had in the Valley. And to think that I've previously been trying to get my fish 'n chips fix from the likes of Pete's ... yikes! And their clam chowder is delicious; I don't need to feel under the weather to have an excuse for ordering this tasty bowl of comfort. The friendly staff and comfortable informal atmosphere complete the enticement for many return visits.Three words:  Crab Stuffed Salmon.  Now that I have your attention, please kindly direct your gaze upon an otherwise non-descript strip center in the west valley.  On the southeast corner of 59th Ave and Union Hills lies Oscar's.  It's small restaurant with an interior that somewhat closely resembles a seafood shack setup you'd expect to find along the shores of New England.  Simple wooden seating, photos and fishing emblems all over the walls, and oh yeah, dynamite seafood.  I had been looking for a new lunch spot to try during the work day and it just so happens Yelpers were giving this place solid marks for the food and especially for Ron, the owner.  When I walked in this time, sure enough Ron was manning the register.  Super nice guy who is super passionate about his product.  Based on my experience it's easy to see why.When you come in, you order at the counter and grab a table as they bring the food out to you.  The place looks like it seats about 40-50 people including the outdoor patio.  Be warned, the menu is lengthy with a ton of different items to choose from.  Ron can recommend items depending on your taste.  And if you're a regular, chances are Ron remembers what you like as he was naming off customer's favorite dishes in succession.  The place was about half full the whole time I was there with people steadily streaming in and out.  I just got a small table near the register since it was just me by myself this time.I had done my research in advance and decided to go with one of their big feature dishes.  A crab stuffed salmon dish with sides of crab pasta salad and mixed veggies.  They have a 10% Yelp check in discount you can apply to your meal.  Total price for the meal plus drink after the discount was about $17.  My meal came out in about 10 minutes.  I believe most of their dishes take less time, but mine is probably among the more complex on their menu.Ron enthusiastically brought it out to my table.  Looked and smelled heavenly (see my photo).  First off, let me praise Ron on the crab pasta salad.  They did not skimp on the crab with this.  I was able to get my fork on nice big chunks of rich crab (and even some shrimp) with every bite.  The cooked veggies were prepared very simple.  A little salt and pepper and include green beans, squash, and zucchini.  And of course, the main event.  The salmon.  A nice fillet with a line of crab stuffed in the middle from top to bottom.  Fantastic texture mixing the gentle subtle flavor of the salmon with the richness of the crab.  Seriously, I think this might be the best way I've ever seen salmon presented.  I pretty much crushed my meal in record time.  I was plenty full and happy when all was said and done.As I mentioned earlier, most of their dishes come out pretty quick and the prices for most of their dishes looked to be around $10.  They also have specials on a regular basis (today they had a grilled swordfish special).  They also have a decent selection of beers and wines to choose from at the front (as well as plenty of soft drink choices).  This place would definitely work as a lunch or dinner spot for sure.  Big time props to you Ron.  You hit it out of the park on my first visit here.  It certainly won't be my last, though it might take me awhile to try everything on the menu.  Or I might just dominate that salmon again.  Either way it's a win-win.People in this town wouldn't know good seafood if it knocked on their door and bit 'em on the nose. I guess I'm somewhat of a seafood snob being from NY and having spent my youth vacationing in Cape Cod. Now, don't get me wrong, this place doesn't have BAD food. It's just not as good as everyone makes it out to be. Let's be clear in one thing: The service was top notch and the restaurant was overall clean and casually decorated. I have no beef with the folks who run the place... Except for ONE thing... If you're going to tout your "signature dish" as being "crab stuffed salmon," it had better be stuffed with REAL crab. $16 for salmon that is stuffed with imitation crab doesn't sit well with me. Let's be honest and call a spade a spade. And it doesn't stop there. The crab in the seafood salad is also imitation. That can hardly be classified as fresh seafood.So, to conclude my little trip to Pier 83 I leave with a heavy disappointment. The service I'd rate a 5. The food I give a 3. I may come back and try something else but not the salmon again. Amd in would love it if they were honest and clarified on the menu that they don't use real crab in some of their dishes. It's just  bit misleading.
Nicky's Thai Kitchen=Finally, a visit to Nicky's!  It's been a long time in the making....but totally worth the wait!I'm a classic Pad Thai girl.  I know, I must stray at some point, to enjoy some other delicious goodness...but for my first visit, it was mandatory to try it since it's my fav Thai dish!  I ordered the Shrimp Pad Thai.  I just come to expect those little tiny shrimpies in my seafood dishes instead of the large and in charge ones, but I received about 5 large, freshly cooked shrimp. Major points, from the girl who eats every shrimp on on the plate at cocktail parties!  I'm into spice, but can't take a lot of heat (it just gets messy around the face area, trust me!) so I gambled and went with a 4 out of 10.  It was the perfect amount.  Made me a little sniffly, but no major tissue issues to worry about!  I was into the fact that there were almost equal parts sprouts, I love those crunchy little strings!  Super extra special bonus, a tiny crab rangoon that was awesome!  You definitely don't get one at Spice Island!  Although the one thing I do love about Spice Island is they use just the right amount of sauce.  I could have gone for a tad more on my dish...but that's me just being picky. The plate was massive and I ended up taking some home.  For me, that's a rarity, since I usually chow down the whole plate.  So you KNOW that's a ton of food!  Service was great and the place was tiny, but super cute and intimate.  I'll definitely go back and perhaps become more adventurous with my Thai food ordering.  I also have to try the Thai iced tea, I kept glancing over at my neighbor's.  But the Jasmine tea was just right for the day!I finally went back to NIcky's after almost a year! Time flies when you're having fun. Or taking time to eat my way through Pittsburgh. Irregardless... I believe the last time I was here I sorta wanted to be impressed more. This time, I was!I went all in and swayed from my usual Pad Thai and get crazy with another menu choice. Okay, I admit it wasn't super crazy. It was still a noodle dish, but hey, you gotta start somewhere, right? I ordered the Phad See Eaw, which is rice noodles with stir fried broccoli and sweet soy sauce. I 'm always into the shrimp, so I had to add some into the dish. And you know what? It was awesome! Maybe better than the Pad Thai. Wait, it was better than the Pad Thai! Huge portion, enough to enjoy the next day. Now I'm excited to go back and try other dishes. Since there's a new location downtown it will give me that much more of an excuse to head down there to "try" the new joint out. Hot Tip: BYOB and they do take reservations. We went on a Friday night and it was packed for such a tiny place, so remember to plan ahead!
Montesano's Eateria=Best eggplant parm according to this bonafide Jersey girl! The sauce tasted like it took hours to make (maybe it did) while the cheese was nice and stringy. Very comforting. Very generous portion with your choice of pasta.The garlic knots served with homemade bread at the start of my meal were so different from what I've known in a good way. They almost had a zeppole-like texture, great depth of flavor, and were not greasy at all- no need to constantly wipe my fingers. I couldn't stop eating them.Their version of cannolis are about 6 inches and filled-to-order to keep the shells (with or without chocolate) crispy. The filling has a nice consistency with a pretty good flavor.This casual venue is just 15 minutes from the Vegas strip and well worth a short detour.I don't get the hype about this place? Olive Garden quality food, but pricier and with slower service. My shrimp parmesan was soggy and drenched in watery tomato sauce, boyfriend's shrimp alfredo was uninspired and boring (tossing in some broccoli or a vegetable of some sort would not be a terrible idea). Overall the food was not cheap, but it was mediocre in every way and the service was slow. We waited close to an hour for something I could whip up in 20 minutes myself and have it taste 10x better.Montesano's is a friendly, authentic trattoria and more.  It is also a deli, pasta shop, and first-rate emporium of memorable baked dessert treats.  A server was slow to take our order, based on some initial confusion over who was assigned our booth.  But, once that hiccup was alleviated, all was well.  She was a fine server, but I would have liked to have been informed of the dinner specials like Lobster Parm I later saw on a board.  A sign inside the restaurant reads "Where love has a taste!" and diners are reminded by another placard to be patient because all food here is cooked to order.  I found great taste in these environs, and the freshly prepared food well worth the wait. I was initially surprised to see that dinners are served here with complimentary freshly baked garlic knots and bread.  Then the surprise turned to shock when the bread and basted knots were placed on the table.  There were 24 Garlic Knots--for only 2 diners!  They were small, but so what?  The doughy knots were warm and quite tasty, and the huge number made up for their diminutive size.  A dozen accompanied us home.I was less impressed by the fresh but earthy Italian bread.  It was sort of dry, and not that tasty.  But this was a minor setback.  For the Stracciatella (Italian Egg Drop) Soup was the best I have ever had: really hot and tasty broth, and chockfull of spinach and egg whites.  An immense "Caesars Salad" with one anchovy as requested, chopped Romaine, Romano Cheese, and fresh croutons was very good but almost overdressed with too much Creamy Caesar Dressing.  A Shrimp Cocktail featured 8 large shrimp that were good but tasted like they had recently been defrosted.  But I harbored no reservations at all concerning my entree of delectable Veal Montesano over Fettuccine, which was simply superb.  This very creative dish featured nicely pounded and tender, hand sliced, and lightly floured milk-fed veal medallions, artichoke hearts, fresh garlic, roasted potatoes, and roasted red peppers, and was finished in a delicate white wine and butter sauce in a brick oven.  The fragile artichoke petals gave the sauce a welcome hint of lemony flavoring.  And the fresh pasta undergirding the veal was cooked perfectly!  The whole edible conglomeration represented a delicious and very nice blend of harmonizing flavors.But I was by no means done, because a lovely, large "Black & White Cookie" in the display case had caught my eye when I entered the restaurant.  I went back to get a good second look, and then ordered it for dessert.  The unusual cookie, freshly baked on premises, was composed of pound cake topped by vanilla icing on one half, and chocolate icing on the other, and was moist and delectable.  The pure vanilla and chocolate flavors startled my taste buds.  Diane's novel idea of biting down on the black and white border to take in both flavors at once was a definite winner.  And, that lovely cookie was so rich that half of it accompanied me home, and even that amount lasted two more lunches!  Affable owner/chef Steven Montesano, attired mostly in red, flitted in and out of the kitchen, watched the front of the house, and came over to our booth to check on us a few times during the course of our meal.  He was a very cordial and accommodating host, and it is obvious that he takes great pride in his fine cooking and baking.  Deservedly so!4-1/2 stars overall!I HAD to come back. I had the eggplant parm and garlic knots again which remain consistently and wowingly delicious. Then I tried the Scungilli Diavolo over Pasta- sliced conch in a slightly spicy marinara sauce and parsley. The conch was cooked perfectly and was oh-so-yummy! Then I had the Tripe- a straightforward name- honeycomb tripe simmered for hours with plum tomatoes. The tripe was just the right texture, not chewy nor tough, and melted in my mouth. So good!  For all the dishes I've tried, the tomato sauce tastes different and delicious for each dish, which means they try hard. Our server, Melissa, was just super with friendliness and accommodations. This place is a must-see/must-taste!I met several friends for a casual lunch.  Feast would be more like it.  The Yelp friend who organized the lunch had pre-ordered what we were getting.  We had a table reserved in the back of this somewhat small mom and pop Italian restaurant.First, drinks were brought quickly when we ordered and refills were constant throughout our two hour lunch.  And then the food started coming.  First up was some bread--classic Italian bread and mini garlic knots.  Very tasty.  Maybe a little more garlic is needed for my taste but good nonetheless.Next up were some starter dishes.  We got two orders of what they call Lasagna Explosions and 2 orders of Rice Balls Montesano.  There were eight of us and the plates were such that there were 8 rice balls so everyone could have a try and 12 lasagna explosions.  The rice balls were breaded and deep fried with sauce and cheese.  The lasagna explosions consisted of rolled lasagna, breaded and deep fried and served with sauce.  The sauce was very good and it wasn't sweet.  They had the good sense to hold back on the sugar.Then came the second stage, the pizzas.  We were brought three different pizzas, a white pizza, a Sicilian fresca (Margarita), and a regular cheese pizza.  I had a piece of the white pizza and one piece of the Sicilian fresca.  My favorite was the Sicilian fresca.  Very tasty and thick crust the way I like pizza.  And you could have guessed it by now, each pizza was cut into eight slices so we all could have a slice of each.The next course was for the serious eating.  We got two orders of sausage and meatballs, two orders of seafood in garlic cream over linguini, two orders of eggplant Parmigiano with ziti, and an order of tripe.  The first two dishes had their meat sauce and were quite good.  The seafood consisted of shrimp, mussels, calamari, and conch over fettuccine in the garlic cream sauce.  I could have had a bit more garlic in the cream sauce.  Then came dessert.  We got an order of Zeppole and we were each brought a small plate with a cookie, a cannoli, and their three color cookie.  Desserts were very good.  By now, no one wanted to move we had eaten so much.Service throughout the meal was excellent.  As I said before, drinks were refilled quickly, plates were cleared, dishes being brought to the table were explained, and the two members of the staff that kept us happy were excellent.  One was Toniann, and I apologize I don't know the name of the other.  The were plenty of smiles and good humor from the ladies and at the end of the meal, they boxed leftovers in separate boxes, marking each so we could bring something home.  My wife had leftover ziti and eggplant and she was quite happy.  I didn't have to cook except to press a few buttons on the microwave.  Really nice lunch with some great company and very good food!Items Selected:Warm Bread and Garlic KnotsRice Balls MontesanoLasagna ExplosionsHomemade Meatballs and Italian SausageSicilian Pizza Fresca - Fresh tomatoes, garlic, basil, our homemade fresh mozzarella and Romano cheesesWhite Pizza - Ricotta, mozzarella, romano, butter, garlic, onionsCheese PizzaEggplant Parmigiano with ZitiTripeSeafood Special in Garlic Cream over FettuccineZeppoleRainbow Cake, Cannoli, Almond CookieButter CookiesSfogadellaFamily owned and operated since the 90's and a purveyor of traditional Italian cuisine for much longer than that Montesano's Eateria had been on my must-visit list even before moving to Las Vegas, but with an extensive menu of classic antipasti, pizzas, pastas, soups, secondi, and sweets the timing never seemed right to sample as much as I'd like - the solution found in the Italian tradition of a family style tasting with seven friends coordinated through the lovely Toniann Montesano herself.  Truly a 'mom n' pop' red sauce sort of place, said in the most complimentary of ways, with a full service bakery up front and walls strewn with signed celebrity photos, maps of Italian neighborhoods in various locales, and kitschy décor it was at a long table in the rear of the restaurant that we were seated and with superlative service, ample beverage refills, and enough food for a party twice our size the nearly two-and-a-half hour meal  could not have better met expectations - each plate perfectly prepared, well presented, and unquestionably delicious.  Beginning first with an opening volley of house-baked bread and supple garlic knots before progressing to fried options including creamy lasagna explosions and toothsome rice balls in bright, aromatic sauce it was at the second 'proper' course that the meal truly took flight, a trio of pizzas ranging from simple cheese and garlicky white on lightly  charred crusts alongside a pillowy 'Margherita' on buttery, thick focaccia-style crust that easily ranked amongst the best 'grandma slices' I've had to date.  At this point sated but certainly not stuffed it was with great spectacle that our final savory course arrived and featuring two platters each of Eggplant Parmigiano,  Housemade sausage and meatballs smothered in marinara, and a bounty of fresh squid/shrimp/sea snails/mussels smothered in creamy white sauce plus a bowl of supple braised tripe the table was literally covered as eyes stared wide - leftovers a guarantee, though all ate heartily with favorites varying from person to person and the tripe a personal favorite, especially atop slices of warm bread from the refreshed basket.  Taking to heart the gluttonous portions provided thus far dessert was ever so slightly scaled back as hot, spongy Zeppole dowsed in powdered sugar and filled-to-order cannoli both shined brightly while Rainbow cake, Butter, and Almond cookies were spot-on authentic  - a characteristic shared by a hot sfogadella that I requested as I paid the bill, ostensibly for 'later' had it not been so perfect...the creamy citrus filling beneath shattering layers not even making it to the car, no matter how full I was.I have had this place bookmarked for some time, so when given the opportunity to dine here with some fellow Yelpers, I was excited by the prospect. We arrived around noon and the place wasn't too busy. We shared a large number of items from the menu.Here's a list of all everything we tried:GARLC KNOTS: Really good. Really small, but warm, flavorful and soft. RICE BALLS: These were just ok. I enjoyed them, but they weren't notable. LASAGNA EXPLOSIONS - I don't usually like lasagna, but this was a nice change of pace from typical lasagna. Moist and very cheesy.TRIPE - My favorite part of the meal. I don't typically enjoy tripe, but this preparation was very enjoyable. Not chewy at all and didn't have that tripe-y smell that usually turns me off.MEATBALLS & ITALIAN SAUSAGE - This dish was ok. The meatballs are huge, however, and I enjoyed the tomato sauce.  SEAFOOD PASTA IN GARLIC CREAM SAUCE - This dish was just ok. the sauce didn't have enough depth of flavor for me and I don't see myself ordering this dish again if I returned.SICILIAN PIZZA - I'm not usually a fan of deep dish. This had nice flavor, but it was a little doughy for my taste. Everyone else seemed to love this pizza, so it's just a matter of preference.WHITE PIZZA - This was one of the standouts. The pizza was seasoned and cooked well. I could have eaten just this dish and been happy. EGGPLANT PARM - I absolutely love eggplant, but this wasn't my favorite preparation. Too much breading and the eggplant was sliced a little too thinly for my taste. I do enjoy how they serve ziti instead of spaghetti with this dish, since I'm not a fan of spaghetti.ZEPPOLES - These were my favorite of all the desserts served. I usually don't enjoy Italian desserts since they are a little denser than I prefer, so the zeppoles stood out for being a little more subtle and not overly sweet. Plus, I can never resist powdered sugar. RAINBOW CAKE - This was a little on the dry side for me. A little too chocolatey as well, but that's just a matter of preference.CANNOLI - I don't usually like cannolis and I can't say this one changed my mind about them. ASSORTED COOKIES - These were good. They have a number of varieties and I would be back for more of these for sure. Service was spectacular. Our drinks were kept full and everyone was extremely friendly and entertaining, making our meal that much more enjoyable. We all had a great meal and there were plenty of leftovers for all. I was able to take some home to my mom who's a pasta fanatic and she loved it. I'd definitely be back for pizza, tripe and dessert as those were my favorites from our meal.Montesano's could easily be overlooked with larger establishments like Panera and Buffet @ Asia closer to Eastern and mostly obscuring view of this location.  It sits in the small strip with Cheeburger Cheeburger behind Buffet.  It has a very unassuming presence, but is packed with delicious flavors.Upon entering, you're smack dab in front of the devilish bakery case full of coffee cake, cookies, cannoli, loaves of bread, cheesecake, etc.  Whilst waiting for an open table, you get plenty of time to peruse the offerings because there is limited space in the entryway.  Needless to say, the not exactly subliminal advertising worked on me and we left with a box of baked goodies to enjoy at home.This trip, after a 15-20 minute wait, our party of 2 was seated at an 8 person table with convention/banquet type chairs.  A bit odd, but at least we were in.  Drink orders were taken quickly, hot garlic knots and bread was brought out right after, and our order was taken within a few minutes.  We started with the Caprese Salad which was refreshing and delicious.  I ordered the Chicken with Peppers & Onions (Caccitore) over penne, which was divine.  The chunks of chicken breast were tender and the sauce was amazing.  I really enjoyed the bell peppers in the sauce.  The portion was enormous!  I ate about a 1/4 of my entree at the restaurant, and some more the next day.  It heated very nicely in the microwave. The BF ordered the Meat Loaf Parmigiano with angel hair, which he enjoyed immensely, but only got through a 1/3 of...more yummy leftovers.Our desserts to-go included one of the best cannoli we've had in Vegas.  A fantastic moist coffee cake, and an assortment of delicious cookies.  We have to stop forgetting about this place since we enjoy it so much for dine in and take out.
Cosmos Snack Bar=I love these kinds of breakfasts places, and I'm glad to see this one is still around.When we walked in the locals eating knew right away we were first timers. The cook/waitress/hostess asked us what we wanted with a smile on her face. This no-frills place has limited seating but the food is amazing. The best hash browns I've ever had in my life and it was so cheap, I was amazed. Go here for a quick breakfast but if you get a seat at the counter stay for some lovely conversation with the employees. They put a smile on my face and made my tummy very happy.
Sami's Gyros=I swiped my badge at the time clock at roughly 5:32.As I walked wearily down the long gray corridor under the sickening fluorescent lights of my office building I felt overcome with weariness. The bleakness of my 9-5 schedule and the resulting placid evenings were grating on me. I stepped foot outside the building and lit up. The sun was setting, the clouds unfurling and soon the night would fall. I strolled over toward the light rail stop on Priest and Washington, the cigarette had made me queasy and I realized how hungry I was.  I contemplated some greasy tacos and a fat burrito from Fili-B's; semi concious of the direction I was heading, my stomach lead me by the nose- My brain was weakly suggesting tacos, but my stomach had seized power, and in this coup, resistance would be futile. My feet meekly obeyed and stomach was dictating, barking out orders like Idi Amin, 'Falafel!' he demanded. Sami's Gyros was mostly empty around 5:40, save two plump young ladies watching the Cowboys and Red Skins game, and the lone Greek fry cook cleaning his station, the door jingled and he looked up at me from under bushy eye brows, his dark eyes made large by the thick prescription lenses he wore. I walked up to the counter and in a voice not my own, made my order.  "A Falafel sandwich and an order of Hummus!" I demanded, slamming both palms on the counter. The fry cooks eyes bulged even larger and his lips parted, the mustache on his upper lip trembled as he replied "1 falafel sandwich, and 1 hummus plate? cccertainly.." he stammered.I handed a young woman in a pony tail with heaving breasts my atm card, she languidly rang up my order and stared strangely at me. I snatched my receipt from her fingers, turned on my heels and sat regally on a high stool that faced the plaza outside. Occasionally I'd glance at the game, it appeared as if Washington was winning, but I'd never been a football fan, and these teams especially didnt hold my interest.  Before I knew it my order came, the fry cook brought out my hummus first, I devoured it, then he brought my sandwich.  As I sat and greedily ate my sandwich, tzatziki sauce dribbling down my face and fingers, I saw one of my co-workers leaving filiberto's, panic and shame overcame me, I tried to hide my face behind my hulking sandwich, she passed by aloof, thankfully- the last thing I need at work is a new nickname. After I'd satiated my tyrant stomach with Sami's fare, I felt gladdened to know that crappy mexican fast food was not my only after work snack option.
Moreno's Mexican Grill=Dos estrellas.My review has been fed into Yahoo! Babelfish Text Translation...twice.  First English to Spanish, then Spanish to English:Not more than two stars. It ate the tacos of fish, #6. combined. The fish was exaggerated and oily and now I have a pain the belly. The rice was good, the beans was hardly acceptable. My daughter ate enchilada of the cheese. She was just very well also. My wife had kidney beans of the rice and the swindle of the flutes. Once again two to star worthy. Moreno' s does not come until now near my hole preferred in the Mexican restaurant of the wall, Mess orderly from in the boulevard of the chandler hardly to the east of the 10. Grieved, as soon as can' t recommends east place.The original:No more than two stars.  I had fish tacos, combo #6.  The fish was overdone and oily and now I have a tummy ache.  The rice was good, the beans were just ok.My daughter had a cheese enchilada.  It was just ok as well.  My wife had flautas con arroz y frijoles.  Again, two star worthy.  Moreno's does not come close to my favorite hole in the wall Mexican restaurant so far, El Ranchero on Chandler Boulevard just east of the 10.Sorry, just can't recommend this placeI kinda feel sad about the two (2) star reviews, because this place is really good. I avoided this place for 3 1/2 years now (as long as it's been here) because it looked a little sketchy from the outside and I thought it was just one of those gross Mexican food places to eat at. I now find myself kicking myself. The hot dog cart is outside the entrance and all you have to do is go in and pay for your dog inside and they give you a ticket that you show the man outside to order. $3 for a pretty decent Sonoran dog grilled on a griddle, wrapped in Mesquite-smoked bacon, topped with chopped tomatoes, onions, shredded yellow or cotijo cheese, tomatillo salsa or red chili sauce, pinto beans, mayonnaise, ketchup and/or mustard, and served on a bun with a fresh-roasted chili. Oddly enough, I liked that the menus are on five different flat screen tv's. The Carne Asada burrito was phenomenal, way better than any other Mexican fast food restaurant. The salsas were tasty which is something that is very important since I always start the meal by drinking some salsa. If it is good, then the restaurant is good. Smoked chile and garlic salsa is always welcome! The green guacamole sauce is great!The tortillas are super soft and the beans were homemade, nice texture and flavor. I still prefer the rice at La Tolteca (but hey, no one can compete with that place) but it was still moist and flavorful. They seemed to have a lot of employees working here for such a small place but that's a good thing because the place was very clean and they brought our food to us.After an intense Sonoran hot dog craving, I decided to hop onto Yelp and came across this little gem of a place.  I rallied up my friend and we set out on an adventure for an early-dinner Mexican food quest!My friend had actually been here before.  He use to work in the area so he knows all the great spots on Arizona Ave.  With the great Yelp reviews and my friend's word, I was really pumped up!  I got myself a horchata, a Sonoran dog, and a Moreno's burrito [AKA a "wet burrito," with carne asada filling and enchilada sauce poured on top].  He had an agua de jamaica, a Sonoran dog, and a carne asada torta.  After polishing off a delicious Sonoran dog, I couldn't even look at my burrito!  I took a few bites of the fluffy rice, the smooth beans, and the flavorful yet kinda tough burrito and I was full.  I think I should have took the advice of another Yelper and ordered two Sonorans and called it a night.  That food coma is hitting hard!  My friend said the bread on his torta was a bit dry but he still took his food home so I think that's a good indicator.  Also, don't forget to stop off at their small little salsa bar.  Their green guacamole sauce is great!Anyways, there are limited parking and limited indoor seating so I can see how the place can become packed fast!  Service is superb and it's always nice to see such friendly and welcoming wait staff --- she really sold those hot dogs!  Portions are also huge and I really could have just split a torta with my buddy.  Anyways, upon reflection and a few more bites of my now cold burrito, I think I found a new favorite place in the east valley for Mexican.  I will definitely be back for the Sonoran dog and their horchata.  Yum!What can I say?  I'm an Elmer's Tacos fan.  I tried Moreno's asada and adovada tacos, and... if you put a big piece of gristle and fat up in my taco, I cant help but notice it as it slows my molar's roll.  You really jack up a taco by doing that... seeing as the tacos aint that big to begin with.I did like the sonoran dog, but it was a little clumsy to eat, with the toppings spilling all over my baboso shorts.  Also... weren't a fan of the oversized pepper that its served with.  But the avocado sauce at the salsa bar is pretty good
Applebee's=i went to this place on Saturday night and the two ghetto hostesses  literally had their heads down on the front desk. I had to ask them if they were open and they responded rudely then stared at me as if they didn't know what I wanted. I finally requested that I have a seat and I sat waiting for several minutes when I saw the waiter who looked like he was either high or very tired and not interested in working there. After I saw the first 3 employees, I decided that I was going to leave. I will never ever ever go to that Applebees.  It seemed like the place didn't have a manager on duty. Avoid this place.
Orange Julep Gibeau=There is absolutely nothing like Orange Julep anywhere! If you've flown in to Montreal, you might have noticed that huge Orange along the highway...and that's where you'll want to end up. This is a drink that is fruity, frothy, and delicious! It may look like plain ol' O.J. but you'd be wrong, it is a mix of fresh squeezed orange juice and some secret ingredient (my guess is powdered egg whites). Mixed together it makes a magical potion that you'll never forget. I am so glad they sell it in 2L size, because I could probably drink one all by myself in one sitting...don't judge me!They have some fast food items: hot dogs, burgers, poutine, and large stuffed pretzels; but you don't go for the food, you go for the drink.Wednesday nights in the warmer months are "Car Night" where people come by and show off their rims, engines, and whatnot. It's a fun, retro experience in a time where everything is going über high tech.
Mah Jong=Chinese ChowWe were defeating the system as we purchased a mini Heinekin keg @ the on site "one stop shop" in the Rio. Beer filled Starbucks cups in hand- we walked around the casino and finally planted our butts @ the food-court like area right next to the sports betting. Perfect!Brew, the Lakers game, and a few steps from some grub. I hovered back and forth from the two choices and Mah Jong won (but not by much). A $12 hot dog verses a $12 Chinese food.. take YOUR pick. Highlights & Low-lights:*Pricey but think about where you are*Ordered the BBQ Pork Soup: The broth wasn't flavorful AT ALL but it's nothing a LOAD of hot and hoisin sauce can't fix*Pork itself was good but overly fatty*Lines can get long so of course the wait can get lengthy as well*Service was middle of the road *Lots of condiments out for your taste buds pleasureYes, I've had WAYYY better Chinese food. Would I go back? Maybe if I were staying in the Rio again and had my fill of Buffet madness. Not bad but not tooo good either!!
Gimik da Lounge=I woke from a drunken stupor not knowing where I was & how I got here.  The last thing I remember seeing prior to the temporary shut down of my eyelids was Blue Martini and the next thing I know, I ended up in the Philippines!  This place had all the makings of a typical Filipino disco lounge...the flowing San Miguel Beer, Filipino servers speaking Tagalog, and Karaoke!  We sat in the patio to get away from the interesting music selections by one of the restaurant patrons and because it was nice to be out there soaking up the mild summer heat.  The menu was a little blurry because the alcohol was starting to kick in a bit so all I could remember were the pretty steep prices & large selection of items.  I was a little disappointed that some of the entrees didn't come with rice because...well...Filipinos eat practically everything with rice!  Hearing "no sorry ma'am it doesn't come with rice" immediately snapped me out of my lethargic state and I almost keeled over in my seat.  I ended up ordering the topsilog (tocino w/ 2 fried eggs served over garlic fried rice) because of this.  I don't know if it was the alcohol or if I just didn't have high expectations but it was the best Topsilog I've ever had in my 26 years of existence!  The sizzling Sisig platter that the BF ordered was also just as good.  Who would've thought that the one of best Filipino food restaurants could be found slightly off the strip?!!  This will definitely be a a required stop the next time I'm in town...especially since I have yet to try the drinks there & the assortment of Pancit & desserts!!
Chez Suzette=The dessert crepe here with bananas and almonds is one of the top three desserts I've had in my life.  My husband and I stumbled across it in 2010 and purposely sought it out on this trip, now with our 2-year-old.  It lived up to the memory we had of it, and even our toddler loved it.  We didn't try the meal crepes, but we can't say enough about the dessert crepes here.  We will go out of our way to eat here every time we come to Montreal.
Milos Restaurant=Wow, loved loved loved this place. The interior of the restaurant is beautiful and very classy, and service is amazing. They're very courteous and helpful. For lunch, there's a 3 course option for $25.15, which is so worth it. They also provide complimentary bread with olive oil from Greece, which I enjoyed very much. To start, I had the salmon tartare, which was very good and fresh. My companions had the lentil soup, tomato salad, and smoked salmon as appetizers, and they all loved their starters. We also split half a dozen of oysters, which were excellent. I had the white whole fish of the day as the main, which was Mediterannean porgie. It was simple but amazing and very fresh, and I love how they don't skimp on the portion size. For dessert, I had the baklava ice cream, which was super good. Also, random side note, their bathrooms are super nice! Super big and spacious and classy.Long story short, this place is amazing in every aspect - service, decor, food. Even if you're short on cash, go for the lunch menu! You won't regret it!
Sbarro=Sometimes thankfully not very often the travel schedule gets skewed and there's absolutely no time to eat between flights and the choices near the gate isn't exactly what you had hoped them to be. This is when you're caught between a Sbarro and a Burger King and on this particular day I really didn't have it my way so after contemplating just doing without I realized I was flying Southwest and they have nothing but a carbo snack basket and if I grabbed a slice of pizza worst case I could just eat the toppings so I did, yes it was horrible pizza but the service was very good and they did have a fresh right out of the oven pizza being sliced up when I joined the short line. I was also fortunate enough to find a small dirty table next the the exit only a short walk from my gate. I don't think it's something I'd do again....Staff was friendly and service was quick. Only one of the registers was working. Ordered the small spaghetti and it was the biggest ripoff. $4 for a little bowl of unsalted, watery, old noodles with a spoon of sour tomato sauce on top. Got a stomach ache before I could get back to my room upstairs.
Chez Ennio=Ennio is my BFF. I love him, I love his food, I love his jokes, I love his accent; he makes me smile and laugh so hard. He has shared so many stories with me, and at times his food has given me a glimpse of where he's been and what he's about.My absolute favourites are the eggplant parm and cannelloni. I've also tried the escargot, gnocchi, and Chez Ennio pasta, all of which were great but didn't hold my attention for as long as the eggplant parm and cannelloni did. I would still absolutely recommend them, though!This place definitely has some charm to it; it's cozy and feels like you're sitting in Ennio's living room while he prepares your meal and serves it to you. This is a one-man-show most nights, guys. So tolerate the slowness, go there and enjoy your evening, don't rush through it. Bring a bottle, or two or three, and enjoy the home-style meal with good company.
New Orleans Sno Ball=Don't call them Sno-cones! New Orleans Sno Ball, Coffee, and Chicory  shares the same building on E. Indian School Rd.  as Two Hippies Magic Mushroom and Mamma Mia's Subs. They serve authentic New Orleans Sno-balls from an old-time Sno-Wizard ice shaver. They had 50 flavors, including old favorites like Cherry, Spearmint, and Grape, and other more exotic flavors like King Cake and Red Velvet Cake. We ordered the Red Velvet Cake and it was tops! The ice was very soft and the sno-ball had just the right amount of flavoring syrup. They carry coffee and chicory and some other Cajun/Creole cooking products and also sell Zapp's Potato Chips. The owner and sno-ball maker were especially nice, and will reminisce about New Orleans with you while you wait for your sno-ball!I'll be going back, especially if New Orleans Sno ball starts selling King Cakes around Mardi Gras. Until then, I'll keep coming back to get my sno-ball fix here.Completing our trifecta of food for lunch at the corner of 7th St. and Indian School on Saturday was New Orleans Sno Ball.  I let the kids choose between this place and Sacred Hogan for a dessert capper after Mamma Mia's pizza.  One went with frybread the other with Sno Ball.I liked this place immediately.  The congenial and conversant owner made us feel welcome as soon as we walked in.  I recognized that the shaved ice machine was older and more classical looking than the one I am used to seeing at our neighborhood Water & Ice.As he began making the shaved ice for my daughter I could see that the product coming out was much finer than we are used to.  My daughter ordered grape flavor and he was so busy chatting with us that he made orange.  He noticed as he was finishing that he had grabbed the wrong flavor and offered a taste before making another one.  My daughter chose to keep the orange.  Light and refreshing!Now there is only one more location to try at this intersection - Two Hippies burgers.  Perhaps another weekend outing.
Cafe Vasco Da Gama=Vasco is owned by the same person/people who own Ferreira. The difference is that Ferreira is high-end, while Vasco is more affordable, offering a variety of sandwiches, salads and desserts. It's suitable for breakfast/ brunch/ lunch, while Ferreira is more suitable for dinner. Ironically, the service at Vasco is MUCH better than Ferreira. Both offer Portuguese dishes. Vasco has basic staples that you will always find on their lunch menu and these include tasty delights ranging from the bison and vegetarian burgers, to the Ferreira club and preserved lamb panini. They have such a great variety of options that you would be hard-pressed not to find something that pleases your palate. My personal favourites are the veggie burger (made with quinoa), the Club, and the grilled veggie and goat cheese panini. All three are amazing.  All burgers and sandwiches come with your choice of salad, and you can usually find 4-5 different salads being served (these all change daily).  While all of their salads are delicious, my go-to is the sweet potato with curried chicken. At least I think it's curried. Either way, it is damn good salad!Their dessert selection is quite good for a small venue, and include the traditional natas and other pastries. If you're a chocolate lover, then you'll have to try l'Entrechoc - my FAVOURITE of all chocolate desserts! It's a tart with a firm crust (I think it's got a butter base but what do I know?) and i's filling is a combination of dark chocolate with caramel and whole hazelnuts. The top is a thin, crunchy crust. It's to die for! On that note, I've gotta go. There's an Entrechoc waiting for me with my name on it ;-)I gave them a 4 because the place is very small, and when you order to go, you have absolutely nowhere to wait for your food, other than at the cash, which has a table right next to it. The table is next to the entrance where everyone piles in to wait for a table. A bit chaotic. If you're going for lunch, get there before Noon and you'll be fine. Remember that the hostess will assign a table number when you arrive, and you will order your food at the back. A server will bring your dishes to your table. You can pay after you have ordered, or when you're done.
Pei Wei=In Surprise this is probably the best Chinese offering which isnt saying a whole lot. I really wish there was an awesome offering out there in terms of Chinese food.. Mexican food, oh yeah, some very good places mostly but Asian, youre better off staying at home and cooking. We ordered the Asian Chicken Salad, chicken was old and had that old gross fridge taste.. Dan Dan Noodle, the noodles were over cooked and stuck together as one large soggy noodle.. Curry with Tofu, the curry had a weird perfume taste.. the honey chicken was pretty good as well as the hot and sour soup though neither made for good leftovers. With Surprise having so many chains it wasnt surprising to see one of these finally opening up.. a far better choice than Panda Express.. kind of sad, huh?My wife wanted to try this place for awhile now.  One of her brothers friends used to be a manager of one in Colorado too.  Tonight we decided to try it out.I placed my order online.  Easy process.  My wife went with an order of Chicken Lo Mein and I went with Sesame Chicken/Steak with fried rice as well as an egg roll and 2 pot stickers.  Total for everything was $24.80 after tax.  I drove down and picked up my food.  The manager their was friendly, rang me up real quick and I was out the door in no time. This bag was heavy as hell too!   Here is how everything tasted.....................Chicken Lo Mein-  Only had a little of this.  Good noodles, good white meat chicken.  My wife liked it.Sesame Chicken/Steak-  I decided to try out 2 kinds of meat.  They let you mix and match which is cool...they charge you for the highest priced item.  I substituted fried rice for white rice (.99 cents extra).  This was touted as soy citrus glaze, red bell peppers, onions, scallions, ginger, garlic and chile paste and sesame seeds.  It was just alright.  The flavors didn't really do much for me.  It was a tad spicy from the chile paste but overall it was kind of bland.  I had some pieces of steak/chicken that were a bit funky too.  I would definitely try out a different dish next time here...if there is a next time ;-).  The fried rice was good!Egg Roll- Eh.  It was an egg roll.  Nothing fantastic about it but it tasted fine.  It came with a sweet mustard dipping sauce which was pretty tasty.  Usual fillings of pork, veggies etc.Deep Fried Pot Stickers-  I got 2 of these things.  They were good.  Small but good.  Straight pork filling in the middle of them.  Overall it was just alright.  I will say that they give you a GRIP of food.  The 2 entrees we got could have easily fed 1-2 more people.  For $24.80 it was a great value.  The food just wasn't the type of thing that  you would ever crave and keep you coming back though.  While I was eating my meal, all I could think of were better Chinese food places I have had before....wishing I was eating them instead.  It filled my belly, service was friendly and the value is definitely there.  I'll probably give them another try and order some other dishes to see if there is something I really like.  We shall see............
Bar Kohl=I returned here for lunch yesterday with some friends, armed with a snap fax.The 50% discount made the meal really cheap,my friends paid around £3.50 for their burgers with chips, I paid £1.75 for my sweet potato chips (cannot eat gluten). This discount makes the prices extremely reasonable.The sweet potato chips were a little overcooked, but tasted pretty good and came with a huge dollop of sour cream. The burgers from 3 thumbs up. One friend got 'the ultimate kohl', a double layer burger with pretty much everything. Another went for the fajita burger, whilst my boyfriend opted for the falafel burger. Each came with a small portion of chips and some coleslaw, everything on the same trendy looking wooden board which Jenny mentioned. Everyone said the burgers were amazing, and they looked it. The rolls looked fresh, the fillings generous. The portion of chips seemed more of a token though, and I can imagine some people wanting more. If I could I would give bar kohl 3.5 stars, as I feel that whilst the quality of the food is good, it might not be worth the full price. I would say the same too about the cocktails.
Outback Steakhouse=Came here after a long vegas night, we were so hungry! You get to ride the elevator inside the coke bottle to get here, it's pretty cool!It wasn't very busy, we were seated right away and ordered. We ordered a burger and bacon cheese fries. Everything came quick and was pretty good- just the usually greasy fast food type of food. It wasn't very flavorful but I feel like I would respect anything crazy from this place.Good service, alright food and reasonable price.ok, so my last experience with Outback was not the best. this time taking into consideration we were in Vegas was much better .I came here with a couple of co workers and a dealer we all ordered steaks and they were all done right and nice cuts. of course we paid the price the difference between the Outback and Hugos Cellar in Vegas were about $20 I will take Hugo's hands down for service. the meat was on point in both places. we had great service and food and a view of the strip I got the checkI had SLOW-ROASTED PRIME RIBSeasoned with an herb crust, served with au jus and hand-carved to order and  wood-fire grilled. with a side of shrooms.everyone else had ribeyes and fillets but the went med well so I will not talk about that, there is no point to having beef jerky for dinner go bit into a slim jim!
D'licious Dishes=I just finished my muffeleta sandwich from Dlicious Dishes and am trying to figure out a way to get back there as soon as possible to try more of the items! Workies and I ordered sandwiches to bring back from the office. They were D'LICIOUS! While there I also purchased some white truffle oil and 2 large wooden spoons. The place is filled with prepared foods that look amazing and priced well. There are also pastas and sauces and breads and all sorts of gourmet condiments. You need to check it out-- you can eat there or take it home. Either way, your tummy will be happy!I've been in here like a million times to raid the counter at Petit Fromage, but I had never actually tried any of the offerings from D'Licious Dishes.  Finally, the husband and I had way too busy of a schedule to go out to eat or to even make dinner at home so I picked up a piece of sausage lasagna and some garlic mashed potatoes here.Once I got home and reheated my food I nestled up on the couch to eat and watch Judge Judy.  I was not prepared for how delicious my food was going to be!  The garlic mashed potatoes were beyond perfect.  They were smooth and creamy but with some chunky pieces every now and then.  The garlic flavor was perfectly balanced.  You could definitely taste it, but you weren't tasting it hours later.  The lasagna was exceptional as well.  It was also really big for a really fair price, 7 bucks I think.  The noodles were a perfect al dente, the tomato sauce was fresh and robust, the ricotta was yummy, and the sausage had a great kick to it.  I have nothing bad to say about this place!  Plus, they share space with my new obsession, so how can I go wrong?OMG DD! OMG! I'm eating my roast beef sandwich now, typing this review and pounding my hands on the table like Meg Ryan in When Harry Met Sally...moaning, groaning and achieving culinary orgasms. Now that's a pretty picture for ya!House roasted roast beef with a blue cheese horseradish spread, red onion, tomato and my favorite green next to Brian Austin Green...arugula! All served on a yummy artisan roll. Such a cute place with a case FULL of delicious looking temptations from crab cakes to mashed sweet potatoes to chocolates and cheeses and VINO!! Great staff...friendly and helpful. Why I'm even a proud card carrying member of their sandwich club. And I'm sure it won't take me long to earn that free heavenly sandwich!DD! Fyi...I will return to you asap!
Cook's BBQ=I decided to come back and give it a try....ok maybe I didn't "decide" but I tried to find 2 other BBQ places Bird & Bones Premium Pit Barbeque on E Desert Inn- closed & Barbeque Masters Wood Smoked Eatery on Horizon Ridge in Henderon which I just couldn't find  and well I knew where this place was. When I pulled up there were people out back bbq'ing  on an open pit and it smelled really good.They have the big $5 lunch special sign out front and after looking over the menu I was disappointed they only serve chicken,ribs and links here.No brisket, NO pork loin, no bratwurst, no chili,no mac & cheeseI ordered a 2x2-ribs & 1/4 white chicken plus potato salad & baked beansThe bbq sauce was very sweet and it covered everything. The beans were canned and the potaot salad was creamy. Really creamy?? Whats up with that?The ribs were tough and gristly with way too much sweet sauce on them. The chicken was juicy but crisy and the sauce worked well with it.I wouldn't go out of my way again but some people might like that outdoor bbq flavor.
LAVO Italian Restaurant & Lounge=Umm we were staying at the Palazzo and they said we still had to pay $20 to get into a club that looks hella dead inside??? You must be on crack Mr. Bouncer guy that needs to get the stick outta your ass. I ain't paying for that shit! I'd rather walk my ass to the V Bar where it's free and play better music.This has to be one of the best Nightclub experiences i've ever had.  Im from LA and have been on the club scene for 10+ years.  I'm kind of done with the club scene, but found myself in Vegas for a bachelorette party.We got a table at LAVO and the service and treatment was top-notch all the way.  I was beyond impressed and i'm a tough cookie to impress.  We had 2-3 waitresses for our group of 12 girls and they took care of us all the way.  I would compare it to the service I've gotten at a St Regis Hotel.  We also had our 1st bottle comp'd.  Additionally the club itself is beautiful. Gorgeous details and interesting things to see everywhere.The crowd was great too, good looking, classy for Vegas.  (We were at Prive the night before the the low-rent crowd there was SCARY- people stealing red bull cans off our table and sticking them in their purses with no bouncers around anywhere).Back to the LAVO review....And to top it off, I ended up losing my passport there somehow!  They found it the next day and Fed Ex'd it back to me immediately.Way to go LAVO - you get high marks in my book!!!!Getting on the guest list entails: still having to wait in line (granted it is a guest list line), free cover for ladies, and half price cover for the gents. A good plus for this joint is on Saturdays for about an hour (11pm-12am) there is an open vodka bar for the ladies. Holla! Let's be real though, they're not gonna be pouring Goose or Belvadere.  It's vodka from a bottle where the label is stickered on.  But hey after your fourth or fifth one...who can tell the difference..right? Haha. Music is good...but the dance floor gets PACKED!I couldnt hold out any longer and finally came out to a nightclub for the 1st time since being a new Las Vegas resident. I had heard about Lavo before (I always thought it was a pool... kinda like Wet Republic) but never went. Also, the thing about Vegas is, if youre a dude and you wanna go out to these popular nightspots with your boys (and plan to get in in a decent amount of time) you either gotta 1. spend $$$ like theres no tommorro 2. get lucky (walk in with some girls you just met, come up with some bs story about how you know someone there, etc) 3. come in late (past 130 or so) 4. or have a hookup.... Fortunately we had a hookup so off we went.The downstairs (restaurant) part of lavo is nice. They were giving us appetizers and drinks (on the house) all night, so no complaints there. A sizeable group of saints fan (congratulations!) were at the bar partying up. At about 11:30 we walked out and walked right past the line to the club (thats were the hookup comes in handy). Lavo reminds me alot of The Bank Nightclub at the Venetian. SMALL. We had bottle service, but there was no rope to keep away the straglers, so everyone was just mixed in (just like at The Bank nightclub). I thought the whole point of bottle service was to have your own space? The DJ was beyond terrible. I kid you not he did not play one song that was made after 2004 until right before I left. Just all Lil' Jon songs. Im not a DJ, never have been, and probably never will be, but I could have came up with a better list. The chick who won the first season of "For The Love of Ray J" (I think her name was cocktail?) is a gogo dancer there. I mean I had fun I guess, but there are definitely better places.LAVO on Memorial weekend = Packed like a can of sardines and it's one really SMALL can too!$20 cover..not bad...TAO was REDONKULOUS anyway!!! Hold hands..restrooms where?! Ouch! My feet hurt! I hate these heels! Why is that guy following you? Do you know him? I lost the guys!!!! TEXTTEXTTEXT...MEETMEETMEET...DRINKDRINKDRINK...DANCEDANCEDANCE!!! Is that Miley Cyrus playing?! I can't see the dancefloor. Let's make our own then! Hallway to bathroom sounds good. I can only move my upper body. My feet still hurt! I hate these shoes! PAPARAZZI PICTURES up the HEEZY!!! More dancing. It's only 2?! We need a B R E A K !!!! Long Beach cocktail is my new fav! Thanks Christian! Whiskey..yuck! Sorry Jay. This wall sure is nice to dance with and lean on! No I'm not taking a picture up her you know what! Vanessa, Melissa..frick it..let's go BAREFOOT!!! Why do we have TAO stamps on our wrist?! Maybe we can get in there now!! PEACE OUT LAVO!!!*****Wow..I can't believe I remembered all that! I guess that's what happens when you go on a spontaneous trip to VEGAS!!! Like my homegirl says, "that was a wham-bam-thank-you-ma'am trip!" Haha. Good times!Since we were staying at Palazzo, it was ideal to do some pre-partying at LAVO. As hotel guests, I'm sure the Concierge could have hooked it up for us, but as I knew a promoter, my girls and I got a VIP table and open bar from 11pm-midnight. Really, the BEST way to pre-party on a Sunday night.LAVO is a really nice spot for lounging, especially for a group of girls. The whole space is very chic and intimate, with the restaurant on the lower level and the club on the top. The cocktail servers are all gorgeous - loved their hot corset dresses - and very attentive. Once we were out of a drink, they were right on it. The crowd was very mixed - an all ages kind of spot. While it was awesome to see a female hitting the decks, the music was also very mixed and after Mariah Carey's "Fantasy" came on, it was our cue to leave. Not that I have anything against Mariah, but I like singing that song at a karaoke club.Tip: The promoters all hang out inside the restaurant, and they're pretty easy to spot as they're the guys in suits on their Blackberries surrounded by women.THE WORST EXPERIENCE EVER IN LVG CLUB I'VE EVER HAD.LAVO your food is mediocre and thank you for a special entry passes to your nightclub. Yes, your special meatball is pretty darn tasty.To be honest, I think thats where the problem begins. You let people eat here and get a special pass for the club. HOLY MACARONI. your nightclub was so crowded it was so bad. Up to a point my body was dancing by itself because people were squeezing me left and right. Drinks were spilled all over the floor. Slippery much? is this a club or ice skating rink? Dance? what dance? I can hardly move and breathe. AND COME ON! THOSE STAIRS? don't you know we girls wear at least 5 inches of high heels? ugh. Oh yeah, better music though compare to XS. But omg, never again for this nightclub.An invigorating dining experience awaits you at Lavo.Upon walking in, you're caught off guard by the perfectly dim lighting and their gorgeous set up. The hostesses were very warm and made you feel welcome. This place screams trendy but definitely not overbearing or pretentious.  We were seated at a roomy booth and were promptly offered drinks and our menus. Our server made it a point to be friendly enough to be likeable, but not overly talkative. The first thing you'll notice is the crowd. No riff raff, just beautiful women and seemingly affluent men. Their menu simple but elegantly put together. Their complimentary bread served with some sort of a tapenade was a great starter.  We ordered the oysters (well not for me), the kobe stuffed rice balls, and their white truffle fettuccine with truffle caviar  (which was that night's special).The portions were about average for an upscale restaurant, so there were no surprises there (negative or otherwise).  The ladies had some red wine, which I think they enjoyed with our meal. The servings were sufficient for the three of us. You definitely don't walk away hungry. Everything was above average in taste, but one thing blew my mind: the chocolate bread pudding with vanilla gelato which we ordered for dessert. It was OMFG-heavenly.  Each bite was paired with a compliment. Yes it was that delicious.  Forget everything else, you just have to try this. Overall, I think what made this experience a 5-star was how well the atmosphere, service, cuisine and of course the dessert just meshed incredibly together.  It's one of those things where each individual factor contribute to an even better outcome. We'll be back for sure.Beautiful Italian restaurant inside the Palazzo, with an outside terrace which is where we dined. We took my sister and husband to celebrate their Anniversary. The inside is trendy, soft lights, romantic, and very comfy. When we were taken to our table, it took a bit long for our waitress to finally come greet us. Throughout our meal she was just OK, she seemed to be in a rush every time she came to our table. Not sure if she was swamped but when you are paying good money I do expect better service. We ordered a few cocktails and a bottle of wine. I chose a Super Tuscan at a reasonable price, when the bus boy brought over these awful little by the glass thick short stemware. Um yeah if I order a b bottle of wine please give me decent stems. After I politely asked him for nicer glasses he did bring over much nicer stems. Of course my sister and brother in law thought I was being a wine snob. It's all good, they have no clue. ha ha We started with some appetizers, mussels, and an eggplant dish all were very good.  The eggplant was awesome!  Then entrees, we all ordered different dishes, their menu is fairly large with many options to please everyone. The presentation was nice, good size portions, cooked fresh. All of our entrees were good, nothing to great. I was not to wild about their marinara sauce. It was sweet and too thick. My sister and brother in law loved their food, and was very happy we chose this restaurant. Food could have been much better as it was forgettable for me. And service well they need some improvement. The view outside was gorgeous, it is a very pretty restaurant, we did enjoy our evening but next time I am so wanting to try "Tao". Prices were high, for Italian food that was just average at best.Yum, yum, yum! When I am in Vegas there are a few things I look for in a restaurant. First and foremost I want the food to be fabulous, check! I want the atmosphere to be alive. I didn't come to Vegas to order room service or go to some quiet empty place. And I want good service. Lavo passed all my 'Vegas requirements' with flying colors. When you arrive you are brought warm garlic bread and marinara sauce. It's the perfect start to the meal and it's hard not to eat all of it.  For starters we shared what seemed to me to be the worlds largest meatball. It was fantastic - moist, and flavorful. Also covered in that tart and sweet marinara sauce.  We also had the beet salad. A healthy choice still packed with tastiness. For entrees we had the chicken, the pasta and a steak. Everything was delicious!This nightclub is disgusting, trashy & classless. Definitely not a Vegas-worthy establishment.Bouncers....um assholes much? They cut off our girls' open bar wristbands for no apparent reason. Damn I know my girls are smokin hot but don't throw a pout cuz they didn't flirt back with you.The line was indeed small but like any other clubs, they try to make it look poppin by allowing 1-2 persons in per every 30 mins. Not very smart & efficient. Clubs make more money off of alcohol bought inside the club & not on cover. So get everyone in fast & you'll profit from that. Duh.My gal friend is a legit Vegas regular so we got hooked up with VIP (reduced admission for guys & no cover for girls) and line-skip tickets. It was $10 entry for guys with the VIP ticket.The venue & space was dark, ugly, small, and awkward. Like a dirty asshole you don't wanna fuck no matter how desperate you are for some fun & action. That restaurant downstairs TOTALLY destroy the nightclub vibe. Seeing families eating while you're inebriated is not the business !!Open bar = cheap alcohol & limp drinks. I believe there was only one big bar on top of the dancefloor. Speaking of dancefloor, it was tiny, yet there was still room to dance. Hence there were barely anyone in the club for a Sunday night.If a club doesn't play house....I don't consider it a club. I don't mind hip hop either but the DJ was playing rap & underground rap mixed with a little bit of hip hop. Um what? This isn't some ghetto club. Play some Kaskade or Jay-Z please. kthanks.The people...HAH. That's all I have to sayInvest your time and money at XS or Marquee !! Where the party is crackin hayyyyy***Club Review***My friends and I got in without having to pay the $20+ cover because we were in town for NAB and our passes got us in for free. That was the one of the few good things of our experience here. The DJ and the music was also pretty good. No complaints there. I'm not even complaining about the $8 I spent on a Newcastle.I am however complaining about the staff with attitudes that work here. I'm also raising an eyebrow at the staff about our missing items. Here's what went down:Sunday 4/15On the dancefloor, a random patron taps my friend on the shoulder to ask him if he lost a cell phone. My friend looks at the phone, says it's not his, then witnesses the patron turn the phone in to the DJ. Several moments later, my other friend realizes that his cell phone is missing only to find out that this was the same phone that was found earlier. Both friends go to club security with the info that the phone was given to the DJ only to find out that club security took it to hotel security. Hotel security has no record of it.Tuesday 4/17While in line to get in, one of our friends steps away to find hotel security to hopefully get more info on his missing cell phone. When he returns, the club bouncer immediately extracts him from the line. I understand that he was only doing his job and not letting people cut. But rather than telling him to get to the back of the line, he flat out tells him to leave. He wasn't gonna let him into the club! I mean, our friend wasn't even intentionally cheating his way in. I'm sure that the 2 people in line behind us didn't mind that we saved our friend's spot in line but even if they did, we wouldn't try to disrespect them. The bouncer just wanted to throw his power trip around on a tuesday night. After some major ass kissing on my friend's part, the bouncer finally let him go to the back of the line.On the dancefloor, another friend realizes that her clutch purse is no longer on her wrist. In a panic, our whole group is searching the entire club for the purse. Club security notifies us that it was found but when they hand it over, her iPhone is missing. One of the guys in our group continued to question club security about the missing iPhone who claims that they haven't found one. But in desperation, our friend says to security "I'll pay you $20 for the iPhone" and security's response was "Wait, what color did you say it was?" WTF??? Why did security suddenly change their story the moment my friend offered a bribe?I do however have to say that the random patrons that we met at this place has been extremely cool and genuinely concerned with all the bad stuff that kept happening to us throughout the night. We even got invited to hang out in the VIP area for table service by a few different groups. Again, I understand that staff is doing their best to make sure that the tables stay reserved for those who reserve it. So when one of the waitresses told us that we had to leave, I tried to politely explain to her that the people who reserved the table invited us to drink with them. She responded with the biggest attitude: "Don't yell at me!" Um...hello? I wasn't yelling at you. I'm just talking loud because we're in a club and if I don't talk loud then you won't be able to hear me!The staff here needs to get over themselves. SMH.Night Club review:Very nice decor; bath (Lavo) themed.Bar area is in weird shape. Bartenders were not very nice at all.Dance area is small. Overall club is small.More of a lounge type than club.Too many bottle service areas. This place needs more dance areas.Place needs better ventilation & shouldn't allow smoking went it's so stuffy inside.They play house & trance here. Open bar for ladies from 11 pm-midnight.If you know a promoter, they can usually get you in free & ladies free drinks & table.   Doors open at 10:30 p.m. Fridays and Saturdays and 11 p.m. Sundays, Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays. Cover is $20, and locals are admitted free Tuesdays, Wednesdays and ThursdayI just remember coming here when the girls and I were super hungry and ready to go on a carb binge. Eggplant Parm is phenomenal. They have a salad here call the Louie Salad which is a mix of seafood (lobster and shrimp) served over greens and vinaigrette topping. One of the best salads I have ever had. Drinks are served in slightly smaller glasses here, but don't let that fool you... way more alcohol than anticipated, and that creeped up on us after about an hour. Sneeeeeaky bartender!I haven't had the pleasure of dining here yet but Im sure that's in the near future. But this place as a nightclub... is awesome. Came here a few weeks ago with a group for Dash Berlin. We had the table directly behind the DJ booth where we got to enjoy the music and intimacy with the DJ all night. It was truly an amazing experience. I really like venues like this one and Marquee Day Club. Where you can actually mingle with the DJ before/after his set. The ambiance was beautiful as well. Bartenders were great along with our cocktail server. I will defineatly be returning to this venue in the fiuture.This nightclub was a dud.  My girlfriend and I stayed at the Palazzo, as such we decided to check it out since we didn't really want to leave the casino.  Upon our arrival, we were directed to a very long line.  We were supposed to be on their VIP list, and that long line was for VIP guests.  WTF? I might as well wait at the regular line because it moved even faster than ours.  This club did not live up to my expectations.  I expected spacious dance floor, high ceiling, opulent decoration.  What I saw was a tiny dance floor that we could barely move.  The club itself was very small compared to XS and some others.  I felt claustrophobic being inside this place.  My girlfriend's foot got injured because people stepped all over us.  We left after 30 minutes.  It was definitely not one of our best experiences.  I want my money back.  It's good thing we didn't pay or I would have tried to get my money back.Items selected:Illy CoffeeBalsamica - Rum, Rhubarb, Basil, StrawberryPastry Basket - Everything Bagel, Focaccia, Oreo Scone, CronutChocolate Hazelnut, Strawberry, Crème Anglaise DipBreakfast Mac & Cheese - Two Fried Eggs, Truffled Shells, PancettaAlmond Crusted French Toast - Cinnamon Panettone, Fresh Berry, BananaChicken and Waffles - Cap'n Crunch Crusted Chicken, Bourbon Maple Syrup, Spiced PecansWarm Chocolate Bread Pudding - Vanilla Ice Cream, Duce de Leche SauceA favorite of friends for their signature meatballs, thumping bass, and eye candy I'd never paid much attention to Lavo until I heard rumor that a "proper" Sunday brunch had been introduced - an interesting menu, beautiful strip views, and proximity to both Bouchon and Ferragamo making it a worthy destination for 2pm brunch on my mother's last day in town.  An ornate space clearly befitting its trendy nightclub roots with friendly, though somewhat cocktail-pushy service and excessive hyperbole (no, your chef did not 'create' the cronut, nor was he the first to coat chicken with the cap'n) it was with the aforementioned bread basket, freely refilled coffee, and a cocktail that our meal began and with the basket particularly impressive given its complimentary nature it was much to my delight that the rest of the cuisine followed suit; substantial delay due to our waiter flirting with two tables full of sorority girls notwithstanding.  Electing to sample two sweets and two savories it was with a trio of selections and the smooth, dense, and semi-molten-centered bread pudding to follow that our meal progressed and attempting to abstain from exaggeration I will simply say that if I returned I'd be hard pressed not to order the exact same thing, the French Toast harkening a fruit infused Bostock and the pasta a peerless example of knowing how to use truffle oil with restraint, the end result a dish warranting an extra slice of focaccia to sop up every drop of the eggy aromatic cheese.This review is for the CHAMPAGNE BRUNCH. Lavo Champagne Brunch runs every Saturday during non-pool season from 2-6pm. It takes place inside the restaurant, not the nightclub. I am not sure what the cover charge is, but our promoter for Marquee was also working as a promoter for the brunch and she got us in right away with no cover and no waiting in line. So be sure to look into that option first. We arrived at 3pm and it was a little weird because people were just eating at tables and there was a dj spinning and gogo dancers. There is a minum purchase for a table with food and/or drinks, just like at the nightclubs. Once it became about 3:30 or 4, the place went full on nightclub status. The lights were turned down, the music was turned up, and everyone was dancing and waving light sticks. Drinks: Pricey but on par with Vegas prices. Most drinks were $13, even a glass of champage. Attire: Guys should dress dressy casual. Girls can wear anything but most girls wore short dresses that are slightly less dressy than the ones you would wear to a nightclub. Overall, Lavo Champagne Brunch is a fun place to get daydrunk and preparty for the nightclubs.*** Review for Spring Restaurant week 2014 menu ***What a great way to end Restaurant Week!  I had a reservation and asked to be seated on the patio (the Terrace, the occupancy sign says).  The sun was in my face for about 15 minutes before going before going behind Treasure Island.  It was a great evening to sit out and enjoy the outstanding Las Vegas weather.I was seated a few seconds when my server, Casey, came and took my drink order.  My iced tea was delivered quickly.  A different server came to take my order.  There was no Restaurant Week menu sheet with my regular menu so she just told me some of the choices.  After making my choices, a runner came by with aluminum foil wrapped garlic bread with a dish of marinara on the side.  Super garlic bread and very good marinara!Back to ordering.  For course one, I went with crispy fried calamari.  It came with a side of the same tasty marinara as the garlic bread.  The serving size was huge.  This would definitely be an appetizer to share with one or two other people.  I sent almost half of it back so as not to fill up on calamari but I could have finished the plate.  Lightly breaded and fried lightly, it was very good!I chose the penne alla vodka for course two.  It was a good sized serving and it was very good.  I slowly ate the penne enjoying each bite and forcing myself to have more garlic bread.For dessert, I opted for the raspberry cheesecake.  The cheesecake was lightly flavored with raspberry--just barely noticeable.  The top was crisp from lightly torching the top like you would a crème brûlée.  There were several black cherries on the plate that was a good accompaniment for the cheesecake.Service was excellent.  Casey came by often and topped off my iced tea, dishes were removed promptly by bus people, and my check was taken for payment by someone who had not been at my table at all.  It was a case of everyone watching how all the guests were doing.LAVO Brunch is so strange. It's pretty much ratchet night clubbing during the day. But don't get it twisted with Vegas pool parties; LAVO is on a whole 'nother level.I really wanted to go day clubbing but Marquee Dayclub Dome was closed over the weekend and all other pool parties had ended for the season. When my promoter suggested LAVO Brunch, I hopped on the opportunity. None of my friends wanted to go, so it was just Craig P. and me.We arrived around 3 pm and thanks to my promoter, both of us walked in for free without a wait. The moment we stepped in, I regret my decision. It was crazy inside. LAVO is an actual restaurant with dining tables all around. People were dressed to the nines, brunching, eating on dining tables, and DANCING on them, along with several go-go dancers. The restaurant is dimly lit, misty, and foggy inside. We weren't trying to get pussy misted at three in the afternoon so after a 5-minute walk-around, Craig and I were over it and bounced.If this sounds like something you'd enjoy, then by all means, come and have fun! It's about $100-150 per person if you want a table, brunch, and bottles. But if you're looking for something more chill, like Marquee Dayclub or Encore Beach Club, LAVO is not the place.Been to LAVO for both brunch and dinner time.FYI....LAVO isn't a full-on nightclub anymore. It's only open on weekends until 2am as a lounge style. There's still music being played I'm sure, but just don't expect it to be a night out full of visual effects, big DJS, dance floor...etc.Restaurant-wise.....food was delicious. They gave us a basket of garlic bread to start off with. First batch is complimentary. Waiter was attentive throughout the night. Keep topping off our drinks. For entrees, I ordered:Brick Oven Salmon Oreganato ($31) -Seasoned breadcrumbs, lemon, white wine, garlic butter. I've never been a fan of seafood but WOW! This was flavorful,  fresh and cooked to perfection. The salmon with the buttery sauce just melts in your mouth.My boyfriend ordered:Grilled Tuna with Roasted Artichokes ($36) -Yellow fin tuna, oven roasted tomatoes, lemon vinaigrette.We both enjoyed our dinner very much....plus that complimentary dessert platter with cheesecake brulee and fried oreos dipped in melted vanilla ice cream was just the icing on the cake to our fabulous dinner date.  =)One thing I do have to mention, the restaurant MAY be a bit dark and loud to some people. (Fobby Asian parents come to mind. LOL) But this restaurant is a definite repeat. I know there are plenty of other Italian restaurants here at The Venetian or Palazzo...or even Las Vegas in general, but I would rank LAVO over Dal Toro or B & B Restaurante.Happy Anniversary to us!! We threw on our exercise clothes and walked from the Aria to the Palazzo.  (Yes, we were completely sweaty because of the heat, but let's face it, we needed to sweat out the booze from the night before!) We stumbled upon Lavo and stopped in for brunch completely on a whim.  Um hello...it was absolutely delicious.  Nothing was a problem and we felt completely pampered.  We left happy and full.  A perfect addition to our weekend--thank you so much Lavo!!
Place Milton=How could I have missed this resto after living in Mtl for 4 years? Well, likely 'cause most of my McGillian friends have never come here. They should have. Place Milton is the place for hangover recuperation.Though, mind you, it's not a bad idea to read there alone with a coffee. Very inexpensive breakfast. I think it was around $5 for a basic breakfast combo of coffee+eggs+sausages/bacon+toast. Coffee comes hot and fresh. A soothing balm for an upset stomach. I would not recommend going with more than one person. There's clearly a solo or couple atmosphere. Heard it gets really full on weekends.
McBonie's Bar & Grill=I finally decided to try this place out, despite the mix reviews I keep hearing about them.  I figured if WFNZ is promoting them, it can't be all that bad.  Now, besides all that, I had a $10 off coupon, and had just got back in town from the beach and was thinking this place had better be good because there will be no cooking in my household today.  I think this place is more of a bar than a restaurant since it's Sunday and the only 2 people here were not eating but watching football.....not a good sign but I stayed and ordered the pork chops, and hamburger steak, both came with 2 sides and a roll.  I must admit that everything was really good:Pork chops-3.5 stars(a bit too much salt)Hamburger steak-4 starsMac n cheese-4 starsGreen beans-3.5 cannedGreens-3.5 canned(very sweet)Rice-4 starsI did hear the server say that the cook that was there today was the best cook on staff.   I would probably frequent this place if I lived closer, but I would return.
Brass Monkey=Brass Monkey isn't just a random bar that you pop into for a pint. Well, wait, it is. Ok I have notorious foot-in-mouth syndrome, so don't take that as a bad thing. What I mean is, yelpers and visitors shouldn't judge or review Brass Monkey on one visit alone.If they did, they'd probably still be pretty impressed. Maybe even 4 stars worth. It's got charm. It's cosy. There's a good crowd and whether it's quiet and chilled or busy and buzzing, it's still comfortable to mooch, drink or banter in. It's got that perfect mix of students and non-student, regulars and visitors. It's got lots of beers, lots of rums in particular, cute wee food deals (soup and sandwich and a pint for £5 I think). And it has free wifi.But the real charm and that final 5th star of Brass Monkey comes down to the staff and if you start to come here a lot more often. They're friendly, charming, bearded (just don't ask to touch their beards). They'll banter away for as many drinks as you can please. But, and most importantly, they're not cliquey. Yeah, the regulars hang at one end and it's obvious they're regulars and know the staff. But you're not made to feel awkward for bantering in equal measure and becoming part of the bar stool furniture for a few hours.So I've let the cat out the bag and letting it be known that whilst I rarely have the routine or time to have a local, if I did, it'd be Brass Monkey. And for a local, it easily deserves 5 stars and then some.Mmm beardy.
Charlotte Cafe=I feel bad bashing what is obviously an old, well respected fixture of the Park Road shopping center. But I gotta do it. The decor is so great, so checkered, so old school diner. Lingering smoke, very intense. Mirrors and bored hostesses. Awesome.For a vegetarian, this place is optionless after 11 am (an no, they won't fix you an omelette if it's 11:10 - them's the breaks) other than the veg plate and an amazingly, insanely bland egg salad sammich. So that's what we got : egg salad on white (there was no mayo, no herbs, no nothin going on here) with a pile of diner fries, good fries, and a veg plate - 3 slices of tomato, 4 banana-tasting slices of fried to liquid zucchini, three broccoli florets with a somewhat creepy "hollandaise" dripping into a pool at the bottom of the bowl. For 6 bucks.  There's so much better food to be had in this area (hell, even this shopping center) for the same price or cheaper.
Ohana Hawaiian BBQ=It's been almost 2 years since I last eaten Ohana Hawaiian BBQ.  The last time I was here, I got their Salmon with rice which I thought was one of the best Salmons one can get, especially at a Hawaiian restaurant.  On my most recent visit, I opted for their Katsu Mini and a Katsu Masubi.  I really wanted a Loco Moco, but cut off red meat for Lent. First of all, let's talk price and portions.  Price is probably one of the cheapest out there and the portions are huge.  My Katsu Mini looked as big as a regular.  My only issue is that it was missing some taste.  From the rice, the macaroni, and to the Katsu, taste was lacking and it was super bland. My Katsu Masubi was also missing taste. If this restaurant was in SoCal, it may be considered really good stuff.  But with the amount of Hawaiian restaurants out here in Las Vegas, I would say Ohana is just okay.  My co-worker had lunch with me.  He never eats anything outside of Pizza, Burgers, BBQ, etc.  In other words, he doesn't eat outside the box.  For the first time, I actually witnessed someone order a Cheeseburger at a Hawaiian restaurant. Hilarious stuff and he thought it was just okay, nothing special.  On a side note, this restaurant also carries Chinese Food.  You can get what looks like Orange Chicken here and noodles.  Really??  Couple of things I do like about this restaurant is the details and pictures of their food. Almost every item that you can order has pictures represented. Overall, I really don't see myself driving out of my way to come here. The location is far from the usual areas I'm in anyway.  However, I still remember how good their Salmon was.  Maybe my next trip is just for that.If "ohana" means family, what's the Hawaiian word for tasty?Nothing fancy here, just straight up Hawaiian styled food. I've been trying to eat less carbs lately and I figured maybe a giant plate of meat would be fine for lunch.I ordered the BBQ Mix plate with chicken, short ribs, and BBQ beef. This massive BBQ plate is a great lunch fix and for anyone who needs that premium protein boost. The chicken was very tender and plentiful and the BBQ beef was perfect! I could have eaten the entire cow if it came prepared like this.The Short Rib on the other had almost no meat on it at all. I know short ribs don't normally have a ton meat on them, but usually there's a little to nibble on. This small set back didn't ruin my lunch, I mean; I still had three pounds of chicken and BBQ beef to eat. As a wild card option I ordered the Chicken Katsu Musubi. This was very interesting, but also very good. The crunchy katsu chicken with the soft sticky rice was a great combo. They have multiple musubi options including the classic spam musubi, just incase katsu chicken isn't your thing. With my sodium levels through the roof and my belly full, I would say that this was lunchtime victory. Would I come back? - DuhMahalo!
Bosa 1=Our trip to Vegas could not be complete without trying one of the best Bún bò Hu (spicy beef soup) places. I must admit I was a bit disappointed that there was no Pho but I was up for the challenge of trying something new. We started with an order of Vietnamese BBQ spring rolls with peanut sauce. The spring rolls were pretty yummy but nothing special. Next came the Bún bò Hu, I was a bit hesitant about trying the blood jelly. But everything else was tasty; the spicy broth was my favorite part of the meal. Service was fantastic, super friendly and knowledgeable. P.s. This place is cash only.
Café Noir=Coffee - horrible.Baklava - mediocre.Straight table setup right across from front door - hella drafty and uncomfortable.Bathrooms - rather disgusting.I needed to warm up in cold winter night, it was there. Can ONS term be applied to coffee houses? I will never see you again, Cafe Noir. You suck.Yikes.
Restaurant La Magia=In the city of Longueuil, which is across the water from Montreal in what is called the south shore area, is the quaint old town area of Longueuil. This little strip is dotted with little shops and restaurants, including this one, La Magia. The restaurant is in a sort of old house, with the front room cleared out for diners. The food is casual, and good for lunch, offering salads, pastas, and pizzas. I had a nice Spaghetti Pancetta, which included a nice side salad, for $11.95, very reasonable and done well. Service in the busy lunch hour was good, too.It's a bit pricey, and the portions are small. I had bruschetta, it was yummy. I had the vegetarian risotto, which was amazing! I spent $60, and the waitress forgot about me, waited nearly 30 minutes for her to pick up my payment. I had two glasses of wine and I'm a light weight so I hadn't noticed that much time had pasted, the book I was reading kept me entertained.
The Sushi=This might the sushi sleeper in Henderson.  I met a coworker for lunch here since it is near work, at her suggestion.  They have lunch specials, plenty of cooked options, and sushi.For my first time here, I figured the lunch special is a pretty good deal. $12.50 for 6 pieces of sushi or sashimi, 1 roll from a list, and miso soup plus salad.  There were also lunch bentos (pick 2 from a list) but all were cooked options.I opted for sushi, so I could try the rice.  After the soup and salad, I was presented with a very simple but beautiful plate...with generous cuts of nigiri and the roll.  I received 2 pieces each of maguro (very deep red, beautiful), nama sake, and hamachi.  They were arranged in a colorful pattern.  I also got the spicy yellowtail roll as my roll choice.I was surprised honestly - the quality was definitely decent for our landlocked region and the rice was good.  I also got a green iced tea, which was served in a large glass, limiting any need for a refill.  Our server was very nice and quick.  We were in and out in under 35 minutes!  It is quiet inside and there is a cherry blossom painted on the back wall.  The ambiance is nice.  This is a definitely a good lunch spot on this side of town.I don't plan on coming back as they don't have AYCE option, yet their sushi is very much AYCE quality. I can understand places like Miko's not having AYCE because their menu is extensive and fish consistently fresh. The nigiri at this place was just mush, the rolls we had kept falling apart and the prices were on the higher side.When we first walked in, the restaurant was empty. I noticed the decor was very lovely and modern and I had high hopes that we had found a nice go to sushi joint near the house. As we are sitting down, my butt has not even touched the seat, much less looked at the drink menu the server asks what would we like to drink. "Uhhh...guess I'll start with water " is all I could say. I then ask if they have AYCE..she almost scoffs and says no. I think to myself, either this will be some bomb ass sushi or this woman is a delusional witch. It turned out to be the latter. As we are looking through the menu in the span of FIVE minutes she comes by at least 3 times asking if we had decided, increasingly annoyed each time. NO PRESSURE. Eventually we opt for baked mussels (pretty good), nigiri sampler (eight pcs of mushy old fish for $19.99)..oh that comes with a miso soup which I imagine salty bath water would taste like. Ex girlfriend roll ($14.95 and fell apart) and Tiger roll ($12.95..confusing... 5 of the 8 pcs had salmon on top, one pc had half salmon half nothing and the remaining two had "white tuna"). It took forever to get our last roll.... we were checked on once where a different server asked if I'd like my water refilled. At least we got the check and got out of there as quickly as possible. $60 down the drain. I think this place gets rave reviews because a) this is hendertucky and b)there are no other sushi joints in the vicinity. Poor service, poor quality of fish, no AYCE, and stupid prices.
Hungry Howie's Pizza=Decent and inexpensive pizza. I chose HH's because, well, they were in my credit card's rewards program and I needed one more "dine" before the end of the year. I've been past this place lots of times and never thought to stop because of Luigi's.Today I got a medium "Howie Maui" which is their name for the classic Hawaiian pizza with pineapple and ham. Well topped with plenty of both, it was plenty hot and it didn't take long at all. I do like quick service!As far as the chain pizzas go, I would put Howie's ahead of Pizza Hut and far ahead of Domino's, maybe it's almost as good as Papa John's. But like so many things, pizza is a very personal choice. You likely feel different.If I'm ever looking for a variety of pizzas for a party or a lunch, I think Hungry Howie's would be a good choice. But if I was just looking for a slice, I'd look to Luigi's.Note: Some people drive this parking lot very quickly. Be careful.
The Clark Bar=Clark Bar is a casual, neighborhood bar.  Don't expect much of a college scene here.  And because the bar is off the main strip for downtown Champaign, you won't find the modern urban socialite scene, either.  Most nights are relatively low-key, though they do host live music from time to time.   The place is deceptively large as rooms are sectioned off to allow for cozy, private settings for small groups.  I love to sit in their patio area in the summer, which also has a layout that allows for some privacy among groups, including a small screened porch (for people who fear insects).The alcohol selection here is probably not indie rock enough to impress beer elitists.  They offer standard beers and well drinks, but there are no obscure microbrews.For some confusing reason, Clark Bar is listed as a "tapas bar" on Yelp.  I think that this classification is somewhat misleading as tapas evoke a distinctly trendy, European sensibility.  While the tone of the food verges into tapas territory at times, the ambiance at Clark Bar probably wouldn't be suitable for an elegant dinner date.  The menu ranges from standard fare (burger and fries) to surprisingly exotic.  My carnivorous friends rave about the ribs, which are served exclusively on Wednesday and Friday.  Once I stopped by and found fried ALLIGATOR on the menu, an exceedingly rare delicacy outside of the deep south (ESPECIALLY in Champaign, IL).  Any appetizer they make with shrimp is absolutely perfect.  As a fair warning, some dishes are only offered seasonally.The variation you see in terms of food might also apply to the clientele you meet here.  Most nights the bars is populated by absolutely ordinary local people.  However, during one surreal visit, I watched as a stream of people dressed in Victorian hoop skirts and silk waistcoats marched in.  Not an experience you'd run across at most bars.  Apparently Clark Bar was hosting a meeting of the local steam punk club that evening.I'd recommend Clark Bar for anyone who isn't scared of a bar with a "townie" vibe.  This unassuming establishment serves some of the most interesting food in town, depending on the cook's mood.  For those who love to people-watch, there are fewer prime locations in the area.
Napoli Pizzeria=First of all, this place left a menu in OUR mailbox...so it was perfect, we had a flight leaving at 6am and still have a ton of stuff to do to get ready for our flight.... So we gave Napoli a shot....TWO hours later and our pizza was still not delivered. We called to cxl an to say that was ridiculous and the girl just offers a discount and says that they are busy! Really? I have never waited 2 hours for ANY pizza. So did it take 2 hrs to actually get the pizza cooked or has it been sitting under a heat lamp for two hrs waiting for a delivery person? Don't solicit or leave your flyer at or even near my home if you can't deliver a flipping pizza in the proper amount of time.  I would never ever recommend this place.This place should rename themselves to orgasmic pizza or something of that nature. Thanks to my scooby doo crew down the street giving me the best referral a girl could ask for, aka this pizza spot, my mouth just had the priviledge of having a series of orgasms, one after another, all over my mouth and tongue!! The funny thing is... our local friend already knew this place and had ordered from them several times for one delicious pizza after another, just didn't know the name off hand, nor had he been to their location. Wooo! Yeah! So... there was three of us to feed and I didn't want there to be a shortage of pizza and/or us to be scavenging through the cupboards of our beloved friend's house late night tonight, so I wanted to go big, real big. I ordered the extra large pizza, aka 24 inches of pure pleasure (half pesto, half italian sausage) and a greek salad for the road. The salad was anything short of toppings and the pizza was so monsterous, we had to put it in the trunk of my SUV! We barely chipped away at half of it between the three of us. Crazy! Whoa-- the pie itself was ahhhhmazing. Dough made fresh, in-house and completely soft with a touch of browned/burntness around the edges. Another yelper said epic, I will have to second that notion. EPIC PIZZA to start off an EPIC HALLOWEEN. Their pizzas here are consistantly good (based on our temporary roomates reports) and never fall short of perfect. There was no shortage of staff to help the patrons and answer the phones as well.The dining area was small and casual, with lots of eye candy to browse around and look at. In other words there was nothing fancy about it, except the orgasmic pizza and the screamin' Greek Salad! :) The staff was exceptionally nice as well!Absolutely horrible experience. Quite possibly the rudest people I've ever met. I ordered $110 of pizza to be delivered. One pizza was dairy free due to food allergies. When it was delivered 1 hour ten minutes later 1/2 of the dairy free had cheese. When I called and asked for a credit they gave me two options. 1/2 half credit for the part that was incorrect or pick up the pizza and replace it in 30+ minutes. I asked for the manager and he was verbally abusive.  Did not acknowledge their mistake or the fact that they jeopardized my health with bad product. 15 minutes later the driver appeared to pick up the pizza saying they would replace it but I'd still be charged for the pizza.  Unbelievable. The other pizzas were wet and soggy. Extremely poor service and lousy product. Avoid this place. I called my credit card company and disputed the charges. I'm not paying for crappy food and abusive staff.
Pamelas Diner=Did you know you could get healthy options at Pamela's? I sure didn't! Although I would love to stick my face in a plate of their Lyonnaise Potatoes, I'm trying to be good (snooze). I recently discovered their spinach and feta omelet, which I love, so I just health-ied it up with egg whites, whole wheat toast sans butter (because they tend to be heavy on the butta) and a side of fruit. And you know what? It was still tasty! I was even surprised how awesome the fruit was! It was a big bowl full of delicious banana's and strawberries! They also have turkey bacon and sausage. I was tempted to add that one, you know, for more protein, but I stuck with my little satisfying dish.This location is very tiny, so I'd strongly suggest going during off hours. I've been during peak and you wait forever! Plus, there's very limited parking on the side of the building. And most importantly, it's CASH ONLY, with no ATM for a couple blocks.So eat up, with loads of delicious calories or not!
Erin's Snug Irish Pub=I was back in my hometown, Sun Prairie, for the Sweet Corn Festival. Good, small-town American fun. Our plan was to visit the Festival on Saturday. So, Friday Night, my Dad wanted to treat us to an All-You-Can-Eat Fish Fry. I asked him about Erin's Snug Irish Pub and if he had been there before. He hadn't, and in fact he had been wanting to try it out. What a perfect time to do this!Erin's isn't located in a residential area. It's in-between the build up of Madison & Sun Prairie. Right by American Family Insurance. Growing up, this was all farm fields. Now, you can't tell when Madison ends and Sun Prairie begins!  The outside of Erin's is fresh and crisp. Nice landscaping. Inside was a bit of a surprise for me. It's really nice. Woodsy décor. Beautiful rugs on the floor. Lot of little nooks and crannies to sit in besides the larger dining areas they have. Plus, a long bar with plenty of seating. The bar was busy, but the restaurant not so much. We got a table right away. It was a little too close to the bar, as for the noise level was high. Looking into the menu, I saw why the bar was so busy. Erin's has a Happy Hour that runs until 6 o'clock. We arrived just after 5:30, so when our server stopped by, we inquired about it. A buck off draft beers. 2 bucks off apps. Erin's has a good selection of beers and it wasn't hard for me to pick one out. A Wisconsin brown ale. Alyssa went with a Raspberry Tart from New Glarus. My Dad got a Long Island Iced Tea. My Ma, well, I can't remember. The menu is pretty well laid out. Lots of selections highlighting Irish Fare. The back page has all the daily specials. Friday tells me that the AYCE Fish Fry is served standard with Beer Battered Cod, Steak Fries, and Coleslaw for $13.99. That is exactly what my Dad & I got. Alyssa got a Rubin and my Ma got a Salmon Burger with Sweet Potato Fries.After ordering, our server brought us a bread basket. Fresh, hot, garlicky buns with soft butter. Boy. Those were good. We devoured them. Our wait for supper wasn't all too long. My supper came with two full fillets of lightly battered Cod, a large pile of Steak Fries, a medium sized ramekin of colorful Coleslaw, and a small ramekin of Tartar & a lemon wedge. I squeezed the lemon on my fillets and took a dip into the tartar sauce.  Solid taste. Batter isn't thick. Too much lemon might make your Cod a bit soggy. The tartar was really good. Seemed to be house made. It was chunky with dill pickle. The Steak Fries aren't a favorite of mine. I personally don't think they go well with a Fish Fry. They are called Steak Fries for a reason. right? To go with Steak? I think a Fish Fry should get the skinny Fries. The Coleslaw was fantastic. Again, seemed to be house made. Purples & oranges mixed in. Great cutter into all the fried food bites.Our server was alright in checking back in with us. I was able to get a few more pieces. I shared with Pheona and gave a bite to Alyssa. Her Rubin was good. I got a bite of it. The bread didn't get soggy, as some Rubin's do. The cost isn't justified of this Fish Fry. $13.99 is way to high. Reason being: You don't get any selection. No choice of side or Cod. A Baked Cod would be nice. I'm happy we tried this place out, and will be back to have a drink. But $13.99? C'mon Erin's. For that cost, let me choose what kind of potato I get with it. Overall, the food was good. But not $13.99 good. The ambiance is nice, but loud. This is a place worth checking out. There's a little something for everyone.
Polibertos=Poli is a little different than some of the other ~bertos places, with a bit of variety in the menu and a bunch of quality in the food.The place is clean and the booths are quite cushy and comfortable.It was good, but fuhDANGah i can't be loose enough to give 'em more than a 4.0The Carnitas taco was great.  (that's pork for the gringos and recent transplants) It came in full size, not tiny, soft corn tortillas, with roasted pork chunks covered in a drizzle of "guac-like sauce / saucy guac" and some pico de gallo.  The pork was standout - tasty and tender and not dry at all.The Pollo (chicken, Guero!) taco was good, as well, but not the best I've had.  Shredded chicken was moist, sure, but this stuff is always precooked and waiting in a watery broth to be tong'd out into a waiting shell, so not too hard to be decent.  Poli's was average to good in the meat, generous with lettuce and cheese, but the hard corn shell was not the right consistency and crumbled into my hand as i ate.There was a Carne Asade Nacho (grilled meat and chips, Pan Blanco!) plate that was about a foot in diameter and about a third as high.  It looked impressive, but the meaty bit I sampled had a wierd taste -- good at first, but then almost 'fishy' later.  Who knows. 8^ |NQI Napkin Quality Index : poor, not the worst i've encountered, but only a 2 star napkin experience, as best.I will be making more return visits, but this does not earn the title of the best hole in the wall mexican joint from me.  (A title a Somethingberto's near you is wishing hard that they had!)
Eddie's Place=Eddie's Place is as homely of a restaurant as you can try.  The no-frills Cotswold location has a wait staff with character and hearty food.  I'm pretty much sold on those points.I've been a few times and I've had their Greek Cheese steak-it's like a gyro on steroids!  Filled with lamb and beef, this gyro is hard to bet.  I'm not a fan of the fries however-they were "chipped" fried potato pieces without much substance.  The other sides are worthwhile however.  The staff are an absolute riot-I got "jostled" by my waiter for my indecisiveness.  Still, its a laid-back atmosphere and it certainly appears that the staff enjoy their job.  Our server was out to check on us regularly and we felt much love.  I'm going back to Eddie's at some point. The menu has some interesting treats, like Cajun dishes and really down-home dishes that I haven't seen in restaurants.  The beverage selection is top-notch, he-llo!
Restaurant La Colombe=After a long, long day of meetings, our work associates hosted dinner at La Colombe. All I can tell you is they have seriously good taste.  I enjoyed the most sumptuous meal I've had in a long time.It's a small, one room place, with a simple, french-inspired menu of  "cuisine du marche" or "cuisine of the market". And it's fixed price, no matter what course selections you make; though appetizers are extra.I wasn't starving, so I went for a simple beet and greens salad to start. My entree was leg of lamb, and it was the best I've ever had...in my life: falling off the bone and perfectly seasoned, over a bed of what appeared to be black-eyed peas in bacon-infused sauce (I don't exactly know what it was, except Good).  Dessert was a perfect blueberry tart with a matching cup of perfect coffee.La Colombe is BYOB. Our associates had taken care of this as well. Did I mention their good taste? They brought quite a bit of excellent wine, and they didn't seem to want to have any left over.  It was a good thing I took a cab.
Daily Dose=I enjoyed my lunch meeting at Daily Dose today... and I will definitely return, but I can't bring myself to give more than three stars just yet.The location is extremely convenient and despite a ton of Spring Training Game Day traffic, I found a prime spot right around the corner from DD.  Score!Since I beat my companion to the restaurant, I had a few moments to peruse the menu.  There is plenty to choose from and it all sounds delicious! There were a few salads that I was looking at and then I saw that they had fresh crabmeat as a salad topper, and I was sold on the spinach, avocado, grapefruit salad with crabmeat and a cilantro lime dressing.  My companion had a cobb salad with chicken.  I have to say, service was incredibly slow - both in acknowledging us and getting our drinks, and getting our food once we'd ordered... and then, even slower when we were ready to pay the check.  Hence the main reason I'm giving three stars instead of four.But, I will say the salad I had was delicious  -  the perfect light and healthy lunch.  I can't wait to go back and order it again.  The breakfast choices are awesome too.  Just make sure you give yourself plenty of time if you're dining in.DD is moderately priced... it would have been under $30 out the door without my crabmeat ($6.95 additional for that).  If the website that is on their business cards were updated, you would be able to see just how many menu items there are that you'd like to try too!  Hopefully they will get that done soon...One more perk of Daily Dose: they have patio seating!  Go now before it gets too hot!As they say, "trust your gut" - your gut instinct is usually right... and while it's time for a DD update, it seems my gut instinct is still right on with this one.Sine my initial visit, I've been to DD a handful of times, mostly out of convenience.  While my rating is staying the same, I will say that Daily Dose is consistent... they provide satisfactory food and service every time!  Portions are generous and the food is good; it just never blows me away... One fun fact for you new moms out there: Daily Dose has a very large bathroom area with plenty of room to change your baby's diaper if necessary - I believe there were even diapers and wet wipes provided.  (This is probably because the owner has a little one).  I'm not at that stage of my life yet, so don't get any ideas, but good to know for those that are!The Beautiful Carin invited me to accompany her to church this morning after power yoga at the Village...how could I say no? :-)I am her "arm candy" in those kinds of social situations...and in fact, I cannot cross over the transom of the church, unless we are holding hands...I have an unfortunate tendency to spontaneously combust when I try to enter a church on my own:)But we held hands and I safely navigated the inner sanctums of Scottsdale Bible Church this morning:)But, I didn't get a chance to retox immediately after my workout and running on nothing but coffee, I was starving by the time the preacher said "Amen, Go forth", etc.We were looking for someplace kind of close to the house, with a varied menu (we took Carin's mom, the Lovely Lynn, out for lunch after church today, so we were looking for a bit more than chicken and waffles:)I suggested we give Daily Dose another go.Carin had not been here before, nor had Lynn, so there we were:)We were met at the door by the owner, Jenn-Lyn (also of Fusion, although she informed me that they closed Fusion a few weeks ago...sadly:(...but, on a positive note, the closing of Fusion seems to have allowed them to focus on DD, because, the everything is much better than the last time I was there, and they were quite busy:)Drinks and menus' arrived right away, the service was friendly and accommodating and Carin and her mom were just delighted with the menu selections, the service and the ambiance of the place, and I agree...it's a pleasant spot:)I decided to try something other than a burger today and am I glad that I did:)I had a sandwich called the "Old Town Stack...shaved prime rib, gruyere cheese and red cabbage slaw on the sandwich...inventive and very tasty!Carin and Lynn had the Chopped Southwestern Salad and the Spinach Citrus Salad, respectively...they pronounced the salads delicious and the salads were also huge (we ended up taking  1/2 of each home).They made my girls happy, and I am here to tell you, if your wife and mother-in-law are happy, you are going to be happy:)I love getting the chance to give another star to nice people for real improvement!The DD is a solid 4 stars and solidly in the Old Town rotation:)What a great breakfast spot!  Came here for a quick one yesterday before heading over to work for our complimentary annual flu shot and work after.  The weather was delightful enough that I toyed with the idea of dining outside, but wasn't sure if smoking was allowed (I don't smoke).  I decided to dine in at the counter, but did find out that smoking isn't allowed in all dining areas, at least not in Scottsdale!  I'll have to try patio-dining with friends soon.Had ordered the biscuits and gravy platter, which came with herbed potatoes and fruit, but all I really wanted was a biscuit and gravy, and soon spotted it among the sides menu and cancelled the original.  My only complaint during yesterday's experience was that I felt my server had pressured me into ordering more than I had wanted to.  I'd asked if their gravy was chunky since most of the places that boast "sausage gravy" LIE, and she assured me that I'd love their chunky gravy, so I knew not to order a side of sausage patties, but she had asked me more than three times if I wanted to order two sides, so I thought of trying the bacon, but decided against it when my inquiry of whether or not it contained corn syrup and celery juice came back positive.  So I went with the patties.  There wasn't a need to order more meat as the side of B&G is ample enough for little young me :)  [This dish kept me going for almost six hours!]I loved this spicy breakfast item so much, I came back for more this morning!  I literally bumped into an old friend, at the Mayo Clinic of all places!, and we thought it'd be nice catch up during breakfast afterwards.  I arrived earlier and placed my order in for a biscuit and gravy ($3.95) and one stuffed pancake ($2.95).  I chose the peach creme brulee.  (This was going to be a treat as I haven't had peaches in three years!)  No powdered sugar, please, and FYI, the pancake syrup here isn't 100% maple.  My friend, who exercises and counts calories as much as I do, was going to look at the pancake list when I, recalling he liked egg-white omelets, told him that DD offered an egg-white wrap.  He instantly ordered this, but also ordered a blueberry and banana pancake made w/ honey whole wheat.  (I'd lamented that the server hadn't asked me for my batter preference, so my pal said he'd order one with whole wheat, for me to try.  A pleasant double-surprise was when he chose blueberries and banana, the latter which I haven't eaten in three years!)He absolutely loved his egg-white wrap.  I almost tried a bite, but didn't want to play with fire since I was already trying my luck with the peaches and the banana.  (The wrap contained eggs and mushrooms...)  I loved both of the pancakes- the peach creme brulee was perfect w/out any added butter or syrup, but my friend's pancake needed a little maple syrup.  Thank goodness I always carry some, just in case!  =)Can't wait for that upcoming UYE a yelper teased about during our jaunt at Haus Murphy's ;)10/24Couldn't wait till a Friday UYE at DD, so I opted to go on my own and try the Daily Dose Kobe burger and sweet potato fries at happy hour prices ($5, plus a $1.50 upcharge for any side dish substitution other than their hand-cut fries or regular fries).  It's not 100% Kobe, but Daily Dose's "own house blend of Kobe and beef burger patty."  I asked my server to have the sweet potato fries cooked extra-crispy, and she assured me that their way of preparing them made them very crispy.  I also ordered a glass of Cab ($5).Loved the two pieces of thick-cut pepper-smoked bacon!  Their crispiness lent the Kobe-beef burger a much-needed textural component it greatly lacked, or so I thought.  (I'm a huge fan of the "crust" that cooking on flat-tops and grills impart on food, be they cuts of meat, stone fruits, bread, or veggies!)  I enjoyed the harissa aioli on top of the aged cheddar, but I wished that the pretzel bun spent more time in the oven/grill.  The sweet potato fries were very unsatisfactory.  I would definitely order it extra-extra crispy, or I may just try the chorizo mac 'n cheese next time I go.  The Gladiator burger ($5.50, plus fries) is calling my name...Thanks to Donald and Carin for sponsoring this wonderful event! Just got back and it was a lot of fun. Great food and drink not to mention the company - shoutouts to Jim and Kevin ... I also commend the waitstaff highly for their friendliness and extreme competence in handling the many and varied orders of 25+ people with grace and efficiency.Just as a side note, I was also taken with the (XTREME?) hand dryers in the bathroom, which told me at the spout to FEEL THE POWERThat about says it all.Thanks again and best wishes for the season!Holy cow.  I could be a Hindu if only the method of worshipping was eating the object of worship.(which I guess makes my true natural religion Vulvan, but that's another story)   `,8^ }The Half Priced, Half Kobe, Half Chuck, Happy Hour Daily Dose Burger was Wholly delicious.   The pretzel-bread bun just took it over the top.The rest of the menu looked thoughtfully prepared, and a brief conversation with one of the principals confirmed the serious attitude with which they take their establishment.The staff handling our patio party was to be heartily commended.  The server was actually remembering and calling most everyone at the table by their first name!The empty plates and beer bottles never lingered long, and the cucumber slice infused (i'll never enjoy lemon-water quite as much again, this stuff was so refreshing!) water glasses were never empty.Perhaps the wonderful company of multiple yelpers and the genuine conversation had me in a bit of an in-clover stupor, but I left Daily Dose with a feeling of fulfillment that went far beyond my belly.Special thanks Donald for the set-up, and Carin's parents for being so hip and cool!Daily Dose Definitively Delivered Downright Deliciousness.While sitting on the patio with a fubar of Yelpers I kept seeing the "DD" logo with it's overlapping D's and red background and thinking it looked really familiar.  Isn't that the logo for the Marvel comic DareDevil?  You remember that right?  Occasional guest in the Spiderman series, subject of yet another godawful Ben Affleck movie?  That DareDevil?So these folks provided outstanding service (Thanks Tina!-she remembered every person by first name and even caught on when I was trying to slip my charges under Brian's name) and excellent food!  The Yelper special was a great bonus!  Thanks to Donald S for hooking up the UYE and the special with the owner!  I'm sure we made up for any loss from the special with lots of alcohol.The burger (.5 Kobe beef, .5 high quality other beef) was really good and the pretzel style bun was a nice touch.3/2, 3/9, & 4/16Took Mom w/ me for breakfasts twice and then (finally!) tried the $2 tacos on Taco Mondays.  Aja (brekky) and Ashley (dinner), our servers, are always delightful.  They're both warm and friendly (and both pretty, too!), and, most importantly, they patiently listen and retrieve the info I need should I require it.  (I have to contend w/ numerous food allergies, it isn't funny.*)  Breakfasts consisted of the ham benedict and the Rosemary Steak and Eggs.  The benedict's hollendaise sauce was silky-smooth, and not too heavy-- it had a nice mouth-feel to it.  The eggs that laid beneath the sauce were perfectly cooked!  They were a beauty to behold, and even more enchanting to bite through...  Have I mentioned I liked food w/ good mouth-feel??  The slices of ham, while very lovely to look at, were too salty for my taste.  (Mom concurred.)  The DD hash, made w/ caramelized butternut squash, sauteed mushrooms, and caramelized onions, was good, but Mom preferred the country potatoes, and I'll have to agree.  I really like perfectly cooked butternut squash, and alas, the squash preparation here has consistently been hit-or-miss (either not cooked enough or too mushy), but the country potatoes are always a hit!  Perfectly seasoned and browned every time.  Perhaps we would've enjoyed the meal better had we swapped out the muffin and hollendaise sauce for a biscuit and some sausage gravy (DD still serves the best biscuits and gravy I've ever had!).  It's nice to know that this option is always available in any of the benedict dishes!  The rosemary steak and eggs platter was a disappointment.  First, we had to send the steak back, as it was definitely cooked to well-done (we prefer medium rare to medium), but no worries, this was quickly remedied.  Ten minutes later, we were able to try our first bites.  Eh, nothing special.  (Leftover steak was less flavorful, moreover.  What a waste!)  Eggs were a bit scorched on the outside and too runny inside- we asked for over-medium.  (If I want scorched and runny eggs, I can cook them myself at home!  Hehe.  Actually, I make great fried eggs!)  Thank goodness that the toast was delightful, but, in the end, who wants to walk away knowing they paid $20 for, literally, toast and coffee?  BTW, the coffee here is very weak.  We haven't ordered another cup since the initial attempt, and should we try again, we'll have to see if they'll brew a stronger batch just for us.  (Hey, other venues have done so, and quite 5-stars of  them, too!)  So, breakfasts at DD that week weren't too successful, but we'll keep going back for the creme brulee and banana-blueberry pancakes (try the gingerbread batter!), as well as the awesome sausage and biscuits (the chunky sausage chipotle cream sauce is to-die-for!!).I can't believe I waited this long to try the $2 taco special on Mondays!  We tried all four varieties (carne asada, and one each of the crunchy and grilled chicken, and chorizo), and Mom and I liked the carne asada the best (we ordered two)!  I liked all but the grilled chicken, of which I had a bite, but Mom enjoyed it.  If you have an avocado allergy, be sure to let the staff know, and double-check your order, as well, to make sure that the guac is delivered on-the-side.  (The second carne asada arrived w/ the guac in the taco...) DD serves up good guac.  Trust me, I suffered through days of pain and lethargy to be able to say this is true.  Try it w/ any of the wraps, if it doesn't already accompany it!*I don't let the issue keep me from a fave activity of mine, though, as some anonymous "Yelpers" have suggested.  I actually use it to my advantage when dining out, as it aids me w/ finding quality venues and the staff that help keep consumers such as myself coming back again and again.Kobe hamburger with pretzel bread. That's all you need to know! Yeah, I'm a fan! I visited Daily Dose on Whiskey Wednesday. That means $5 whiskeys. After one of those, I just had to eat something! Well, hello Kobe burger! I chose the Daily Dose burger which 8oz is topped with cheddar & jack, peppered bacon, fresh basil, shaved onion, tomato & harissa aioli on a toasted pretzel bun! Whew! The burger was tasty and the pretzel bun was a master stroke. The meat was juicy and cooked to order (medium for me). The toppings added to the flavor of the burger and the pretzel bun was chewy and salted just like a YUMMY pretzel. I was a happy girl! I hope to visit Daily Dose for breakfast, maybe a lunch! I hope they can wow me like they did before!After so many review updates, I usually cease to write more unless I have something really noteworthy to add (a new menu addition or fave dish, or great customer service rendered, etc).  Unfortunately, I will have to say that this morning's breakfast of biscuits and gravy and a platter of peach creme brulee pancakes didn't have us leaving w/ happy stomachs :(  There were a couple of hitches, but these were easily amended.  (I think my love affair of DD's biscuit and gravy has ended.)  My major gripe was that our gingerbread pancakes did not contain candied ginger pieces-- did Daily Dose switch to a new mix/formulation?  If yes, please switch back!  The pancakes we had today were too dense and not at all the flavorful-spicy and texturally-exciting cakes we've had in the past :(  The peach creme brulee sauce also didn't arrive warmed, and instead was squeezed unappetizingly onto a sauce dish.  The leftovers that I usually get to enjoy again on one of my work breaks ended up in the trash.I'm going to go back again soon to give DD another try... I'd like to keep it on my list of fave brekky places!This was a great spot to grab some much needed breakfast sustenance after a night of drinking and partying all night long in the Arizona desert!We were seated very quickly and had our food come to us very quickly as well which was totally awesome because I was hungry!They have a menu that was full of delicious options but the Hangover Sandwich definitely caught my eye for being one of the best things they had to serve.The sandwich itself was oh soooo good packed with a flavor of grilled jalapeños, onions, eggs and breakfast meats what more could you ask for?The sandwich also came with a fruit cup and some potatoes all of which were quite good and went well with the flavor of the sandwich.This is definitely a place I would come to again for breakfast if I was in the area great selection and the Breakfast Bacon Bloody Mary sounded amazing as well if your into that kinda thing like I am!After our RnR visit was a fail, we settled for Daily Dose and I am glad we did!My study group and I were going to have study session Sunday, but in order to get our thinking caps on, we needed food first.We were seated at a high top table and greeted by our waitress promptly. We ordered two bloody Mary's and a lame-o ordered a diet coke. I chose the Bloody Mary with cucumber vodka upon the servers recommendation. Boy, did she screw me over...it wasn't good. Actually, even the regular one wasn't good. So..I got a michelada! YAS! which was so much better!Food time! As our appetizer, we ordered the chicken nachos...BEST NACHOS EVER!!! so many ingredients, and cheese ( I LOVE cheese!), and this cheese sauce that was a little spicy but so good! mmmmm! I got the turkey sausage omelet and added mushrooms to it. It came with a side of seasons potatoes and your choice of butternut squash hash, cottage cheese, or fruit. Well I asked for the servers recommendation (I am extremely indecisive), and she said the butternut squash was good. Once again, she screwed me over because I hated it. Everything else was excellent! The potatoes had the perfect amount of seasoning and were cooked to a crisp. The omelet was exploding with flavor. I don't remember what my friends got but they were pretty happy with their choices. We were all in food coma shortly after. Our plates were not even half eaten before we stopped eating because it was THAT much food. As much as we hated to stop eating, we had to or else the rest of the day would have been bad.The prices are really good here! So much food for like $10.00! Cant beat that! Service was good, I just wish my server had better taste in food.I will be coming back fa sho!
Jim's Burros=If you have ever lived in or traveled through a rural area, the number one rule for finding a good restaurant is to look for the parking lot that is full. Look for the parking lot that has the farmers trucks, the police cars or the fire trucks. When you find this place, you have found the best place in town. Don't worry when you drive by this place that it looks like a little SHACK!!  Because that is just what it is. A place so small and off to the side of the road that if you aren't looking for it, you would miss it. A place so small that if you do see it, you would never think to stop. But if you do venture to try this small shack of a restaurant, you are in for a treat. Jim's Burros offers a small menu of more typical burritos and tacos. They offer a limited breakfast menu, but offer it all day long. And have a daily .99 cent menu item. My favorite... Taco Tuesday... Ground beef tacos on hard shells. Six usually does the trick for me. But that still gets me out the door for less than $7.00. Jim's Burros provides a great food, at an exceptional prices. Most items run less than $6.00. Take Out takes less than 10 minutes. Call ahead and your food is usually ready by the time you get there... I live 5 minutes away and my order is always ready by the time I arrive. If you do Take Out, spend the extra couple of bucks and get a large side of salsa also. It saves well and is better than anything you will ever find in the store. Want a change, try the Chili Reno. A large green chili wrapped in egg and smothered in green chili sauce. This is not an appetizer, this baby is huge. Want a traditional breakfast? Pancakes are so huge that three are two large to for me to finish. Omelette's that are filling. And breakfast burritos that are huge. Again, all for less than about $5.00. Eat In, you get chips and salsa at the table while you wait. Just a perfect taste waiting for the meal. My only complaint.... They are not open on Sunday. This would be perfect for breakfast burrito take out on Sunday morning for Sunday football. If you make it to Queen Creek area, look for the small shack on the side of the road. They have added signs and store decorations to make it more visible. So don't be afraid. It might be a hole in the wall place, but you won't regret it...Remember, if you live in the community, always support your local places. Good restaurants that are just around the corner are few and far between.  So forget the chain places like Filberto's that seem to have popped up everywhere, support the local businesses!!!This is really hard for me. Really, really hard. I have been eating here since the place opened, have loved it. Recently, things have been changing. Ingredients, prices, items on the menu. Food has gotten bland, expensive, and on this last trip has made me sick for going on five days now. I do not believe that the kitchen staff is handling meats the correct way, thus giving me food poisoning. Jims, if you are reading this, STOP! You guys were AWESOME. Go back to quality ingredients not crap we can buy in the frozen section at Frys. Stop changing the menu. Stop increasing your prices while decreasing your costs by using cheap ingredients. Have some pride in your work again. Bacon is supposed to be crispy and fried, not limp and tasting like it came from a microwave. I will not even comment on the burrito that made me sick because it will just put me back in the bathroom. When something is good, don't change it. I cannot tell you I will be back here again, food poisoning is not something I an inclined to risk again. I would sure hate to see the place close down, but you make your other regulars sick, they likely won't be coming back either.
Original Tommy's=The hot dog and fries were very good! Hubby is the burger eater and scarfed down his.It seems a lot of people are always come into this location by foot when I am here. Sometimes there are just groups of people sitting outside eating Tommy's. There isn't a table people just sit on the curb or near the side of walmart. I always wonder if I am missing out on something or avoiding something shady. This isn't my favorite of the NV Tommy's locations but the food is consistent and the workers are very friendly so when working on this side of town it hits the spot.  I haven't tried their breakfast yet we always make it for lunch or dinner!.. :)LAST TOMMY 'S WAS 25 YEARS AGOHamburger with chili no cheese. Momo didn't even share with Yu-go. Hot dog with chili, onions, cheese, pickles and tomatoes ...larger than life, smothered with dripping chili topped with large sliced condimentsChili fries ...piping hot!
J & G Steakhouse=Located on the fifth floor at the Phoencian resort, J&G Steakhouse is a dark, open, sophisticated space. If your schedule is flexible, I would recommend dining around sunset to get that extra ambiance. However, even at 8 pm (that is the time we had reservations), the twinkling lights in the distance gave an extra romantic feel.My husband and I decided to have a date night on Friday night, and we chose J&G since it was Restaurant Week and we had been wanting to try it. As most other reviews have said, the service is incredibly lacking and is only 2 stars. Luckily the food is exceptional and pretty much makes you forget how poor the service is that you are receiving. We both ordered the RW menu - I had the caesar salad, parmesan crusted chicken, and the chocolate cake with caramel ice cream. The caesar salad was very fresh and for an appetizer was quite large. The chicken was the highlight for me. You get two nice sized chicken breasts (I could only eat 3/4 of one because they were so large)...the chicken was so incredibly moist. Plus the parmesan crust on the chicken gave it an upscale fried chicken feel and had a hint of saltiness to it which I loved. The chocolate cake was sinful - once you broke into the cake, there was molten chocolate inside which was complimented perfectly by the ice cream. My husband loved all of his food (tomato soup, hanger steak with fries, apple tart) and even shared the french fries that came with his steak with me (the fries were salty and delicious). With our entrees, we also ordered a side of the mashed potatoes which were amazing. They were so smooth and had just the right amount of butter in them. I only wish the side had been bigger because we argued over who got the last scoop!For a beer, two RW menus, and a side of mashed potatoes, our bill before tip came to $79 which we thought was great. For a nice, resort steakhouse, the prices on the regular J&G menu are incredibly reasonable and we are already planning another trip back to try more items on the menu!9/23Had a friend meet me here for Restaurant Week.  We both weren't dressed for the Phoenician, but I didn't care (and soon, he didn't either).  It's a good thing, too, bec. in the end, we found that this place wasn't ostentatious nor that pretentious.  Dressed casually, we still managed to have a good time, despite the overall lackluster dining experience.First off, let me say that the service could pick up their heels a bit.  By the time we received our expensive alcoholic beverage choices, more than 20 minutes had elapsed.  ($15 for a glass of Cab and $11 for a tiny glass of mimosa?  Are you serious??)  Our first plate, a sub-par Caesar salad, arrived close to an hour after we were seated.  But perhaps the fault wasn't entirely J&G's... Digestif's Caesar salad pretty much demolished all other competitors, I'd say.  How about I testify that tonight's salad was crispy.  That's saying something nice, right?  No flavor, no creamy eggy goodness, but somewhat crispy.  The decimated croutons didn't help the situation...For the entree, we had the skirt-steak & frites.  The latter weren't any better than what you would find at McDonalds'.  (Seriously, I'm not making this up.  Just check out the photos and you'll see I'm all about the truth!)  But the skirt steak!  This baby wasn't much to gaze at, but it was tasty.  Let's just say it was delicious enough for me not to cry over the expense we spent that night on a barely-touched salad, a cheap cut of steak, three beverages, and tip.  Now onto the star of the show... chocolate cake w/ caramel ice cream!  Wait for it... homemade caramel ice cream!  And chocolate-lava cake shaped like a star.  Oh. My. Freakin'. God.  This should be renamed "Foreplay."  Nice ambience, despite it being darker than I would like and that we were seated far away from the panoramic views.  I appreciated the privacy, though.  Women's restroom was clean and orderly, and walking past little caches of wine bottles was a nice touch.  The grounds looked pretty, but I was more impressed w/ the property at The Arizona Grand...J & G = my husband's and my first initials.  For that reason alone, I've been wanting to try this Steakhouse.  The menu is created by Michelin starred Chef, Jean-Georges Vongerichten.  The restaurant resides atop the high end Phoenician Resort.  And I've heard many a good review about this place.  Unfortunately, my expectations were too high; my experience at J & G was mediocre.Our team of servers led by Justis was not the problem, the service was fine.  And the drinks were decent too... I especially was happy with my extra dirty Goose martini - it was as big as my head and went down smooth.  But the food was not worth the money!  The rolls they serve don't compare to the popovers at BLT or the bread basket at Mastro's.  The Caesar salad didn't have much flavor.  The Rib eye  steak, while a nice portion, was dry and lacked typical rib eye flavor.  The Chilean Sea Bass was just ok... and I typically love sea bass, especially when it's prepared with a miso-yuzu broth, but I've had better.  And while I didn't try the sweet and sour pork belly, the guys at our table left half of it uneaten.  That's gotta say something.On the other hand, our party of five enjoyed the oyster appetizer and the family style sides (roasted mushrooms, steamed broccoli, and creamed spinach).  We also enjoyed the ambiance, the beautiful view, and the desserts.  My favorite was the carrot cake but we also tried an apple tart and the chocolate lava cake.Bottom line - it really comes down to the food... If you're looking for an incredible steak house, there are a handful of others I'd recommend before J & G.Friday night was going to be burger night; we were going to go to Relish Burger Bistro, the new restaurant at the Phoenician Clubhouse... (and I was going to get the FTR), but there were no outdoor tables when we arrived, and while the menu was appealing, sitting inside was not, so we decided to head back to J & G to give them another shot.We lucked out at J & G and were given a prime table outside with incredible views... it was me, Jared, my brother, and my parents, and it was a beautiful night!  I was exhausted as I came from an afternoon of drinking and hanging out at both the Giants Spring Training game and The Lodge... but I woke up for the meal that was ahead of me.  I drank water but my dad went for the Elderberry Specialty Cocktail and really enjoyed it and my mom had a couple of drinks too... oh, and my bro had a Steamworks beer!Justis was our server again, and we had several other staff members catering to our every need including an extremely friendly GM.  The fresh bread was better than I remembered from our previous visit.  I started with the wedge salad (and so did my dad and brother).  We were all extremely pleased as the salads were chilled just right, the lettuce was fresh and crisp, and had the perfect balance of tomato, crispy bacon, and blue cheese dressing.  We also shared some appetizers for the table including Crispy Calamari, Parmesan Risotto, and Warm Beets.I went with the Crab Cake for my entree... much better than the sea bass I had previously during my first visit.  Served with avocado, cucumber, and a sweet sauce, the serving size was plenty, and it was delicious!  The texture was crispy on the outside, and warm and creamy on the inside.  I also dug into the sides that we shared at the table including asparagus, creamed spinach, roasted mushrooms, and french fries that came with the burgers... (my mom, J, and Z had burgers).  My dad really enjoyed his Veal Porterhouse.  And as if we weren't full enough, we shared a few desserts.  My favorite was still the Carrot Cake and everyone else loved the Apple Tart.And as I'm typing this review, I'm smiling just thinking about what a memorable night we had at J & G... I'm really happy we gave them another shot!  The other funny thing I'm smiling about is that I just wrote about the menu items we had and that I would recommend, and I think they are getting ready to change their menu... we were told they do so on a quarterly basis.  I just hope that the new Spring menu is as good if not better than the one we had on Friday.  And I hope that our future visits will continue to be five stars as well.  As the saying goes, "you never get a second chance to make a first impression," but in this case, I'm glad we gave J & G a second chance - and I bet they are too... after all, I'm bumping my rating up from three stars to five!  Thanks J & G!Simply delicious. That's how I describe J & G Steakhouse. Not only is the food delicious, but the atmosphere is quite perfect as well! J & G Steakhouse sits atop the Phoenician and overlooks the Valley. Every seat in the house is excellent with a window view and it's a perfect setting for a romantic date or a special dinner. In addition to the dining room, the lounge is perfect to sit and enjoy a couple cocktails as well! The food here is delicious and everything I would expect from J & G Steakhouse. We recently stopped by to try out the neighborhood menu special which is quite simply, a steal. For $39 a person, you order from a prix fixe three course meal that includes an appetizer, entree and dessert. I started with the split grilled shrimp salad which had a delectable dressing to go with it. For my entree, I enjoyed the flat iron steak with BBQ sauce. The steak was cooked perfectly and a tasty combination of tender and juicy. We ended up having a medley of dessert and each one was more delicious then the next! I decided that you really can't go wrong with any dessert here, or really any item from the menu for that matter, it all just depends on your taste bud's likings. This is on the list of one of my favorite steak houses in the Valley and it's because of beautiful atmosphere and delicious food combined. If you have a loved one, want to woo a date or simply want to have a special night out on the town, I highly suggest J & G Steakhouse! For a more budget-friendly evening, check out their neighborhood menu from 5-7 PM nightly through September!400th Review!!!!!!!!I have been dying to try J & G Steakhouse for a very long time, and when I saw there was a group of Yelpers going to try them out during the fall restaurant week I knew this was my chance!  1st off, let's talk about the amazing view, you can see for miles, I honestly didn't want to leave, just wanted to watch the city lights twinkle and soak up the view!For restaurant week, J&G offered a few choices, for me, I went to a steakhouse, so gosh darnit I'm having me some steak!! hahaI started with an arugula & boston lettuce salad with a mustard vinaigrette, now if you don't care of the bitter taste of the arugula, then this salad is not for you, but for me, everything blended perfectly.   I ordered the prime top sirloin cap which also came with a broccoli purée and some roasted garlic & chili flakes on the side, now the broccoli purée on its own tasted very wheat grassy green, if that makes since but the waiter told us to spinkle the garlic chili flakes over the steak and mix the steak with the purée, and OMG AMAZING!!!! The flavors all complement each other! Next thing I knew my steak was gone!! So good!!!   Ended my meal with caramel ice cream and a warm chocolate molten cake, omg so good!!! Love the combination of caramel and chocolate, had I not been at the J&G I'm pretty sure I would have licked my plate clean (not really, but yes it's that good).Enjoyed my evening at J&G and with the company I was with, amazing views, great service, and excellent food! Hope to be back soon!I really wanted to like this place after having such a great time and fantastic cocktails during the Yelp Cocktail society.  Alas, the experience came out to be a 3 star average for me.First of all, this place is beautiful on the inside.  As you walk in, you first notice that it is clean and modern with a sexy South Beach kind of feel to it.  I got the immediate feeling that beautiful people come here and stay and come back.  As you round the corner of the hostess stand, you see the spectacular view.  A beautiful view.  I'm still kicking myself that I had not come here before the Yelp Coctail society earlier this summer.  I recommend to anyone coming here to please go just before sunset so you can appreciate the stellar view this restaurant provides.We were seated right by the window with a clear panoramic view facing southeast of the Valley.  We were greeted by our server and ordered a few drinks.  We were not in any rush, this was a b'day dinner/celebration for me, so it was a casual happy event for us.  This is where things kind of went down hill.....The server must have had too many tables to wait on.  He had some support staff, but we waited for very long intervals between ordering drinks, appetizers and dinner.  I generally don't like that.  And my friend, who is not easily irritated, even noticed how long it was taking the server to come back.So, we finally order our meal.  We decided to go for the 32oz bone in Australian Wagyu Ribeye for 2 that was to be sliced table side.  Cool,  a huge piece of meat, cooked Medium Rare.   We order the sides.  Our steak comes out and... its pretty much just shy of being cold.  Definitely not warm.  We are perplexed by it  to be honest, but one thing that worked in their favor, the time we waited to place our order... and with us both practically starving.. NEITHER one of us would have sent it back - at least the sides were hot!  ha!  so, I ate my steak and kept my mouth shut.  The steak itself taste good.  Just the temperature of it was wrong.For dessert, they brought out the obligatory b'day cake.  A molten chocolate cake.  Unfortunately, that was the LAST thing I wanted to have.  I had had so much molten chocolate cake on my vacation the week before, that anyone else's cake would have HAD to be flawless for me to enjoy it, there's wasn't.  not enough chocolate and it tasted like it was not made with any salt.  Also it wasn't very sweet.  so... YIKES.  I'm giving them a 3 star review largely because I expect something better out of a restaurant in which 2 people spend $250+ on dinner.
Yama Asian Fusion=Third time is the charm...still great and consistent! If you are in the mood for sushi during "off peak" hours (e.g., in between lunch and dinner), Yama is open! I was starting to get hungry around 3pm and I tried 3 different places and by the time I arrived at each place they were closed between lunch and dinner. I guess I was meant to eat at Yama.This could be one of the best sushi places in Charlotte.  I have been here three times now, and have yet to be disappointed.  The staff is friendly and they are more than willing to change a tv to your game of preference.  The best part?  If you order enough sushi, they will bring it out on a boat.  Definitely impressive.  They have all sorts of special rolls that they make, with descriptions on the menu.  As well as the typical assortment of nigiri.The atmosphere is very classy, but you could definitely go in jeans.  They also have a bar area.  I think the fusion comes from the ingredients that they use in their specialty rolls.  They even have soy paper wrapped rolls for those who do not indulge in seaweed.  They were not bad.  Also, another thing is they have a decent amount of non fried rolls.  Many places go overboard on the fried rolls which is a bit much at times.I have only been during dinner time.  Edamame is good.Some of the best sushi that I have had in a while....great rolls with good sauces to complement them. The Chicken Katsu was pretty good for katsu as well (meaning katsu tastes pretty similar in general). The chicken was good quality and the katsu sauce was flavorful. We had the Tempura ice cream for dessert and it was phenomenal.My wife and I are from CA and have been looking for good sushi in the Charlotte area and have finally found a place we both really like! We can't wait to go back and try some more rolls!Note: its not so much Asian Fusion as it is authentic Japanese foodI. Love. This. Place.If you asked me one food I could eat every day for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, it would be sushi. And if you asked for specifics? It would be sushi from Yama. Love the miso soup. Love the seaweed salad (and my husband loves the squid salad). We both love the sushi and sashimi -- it's fresh, delicious, there's a wide selection, and if you order enough of it, they'll even bring it to you on a wooden boat.Haven't tried any of the "fusion" that goes on here, though -- I'm perfectly content with the best sushi in Charlotte.Yama-lujah!  I just found my new favorite sushi spot in Charlotte! A fellow foodie recommended this place as the best sushi in Charlotte......really? After hearing that, I made it a priority to check it out after my next monthly visit to Earth fare. It took me forever to decide on a roll, even though I had studied the menu prior to going, but the server was so very helpful with her recommendations and they were eager to cater to whatever you asked for.......gotta love great service! I finally decided on the Southpark and Filet lover's roll and they both were out of this world good! As good as it was, I'm still hesitant to jump on that 'best sushi' in Charlotte train as Enso's sushi is equally as good as Yama in my opinion, but I will definitely be back........perhaps I'll need to save up before my next visit as the rolls are quite pricey at Yama, but worth every penny:-)I came with my boyfriend and his family for dinner and all six of us were sorely, sorely disappointed. Not only was the food overpriced and gross, but the manager was all kinds of shady.What we ordered:Tempura appetizer ($8.95)Morrison Roll ($13.95)Sunrise Roll ($9.95)Honeymoon Roll ($5.95)Hibachi Chicken entree ($13.95)Hibachi Steak & Scallop entree [+ upgrade to filet mignon] ($22.95)The rolls were DINKY and mediocre at best. My boyfriend says he can find better rolls at Harris Teeter. The chicken in the hibachi chicken entree was overcooked, dry, and salty. The steak in the hibachi steak entree was super dry and supposed to be medium rare, which it wasn't.Honestly, tacking on "Asian Fusion" to your restaurant name does not give you an excuse to serve poorly-made, half-assed, inauthentic "Japanese" food.The fun doesn't stop there. When I got the check, I was surprised to see "19.67% Gratuity" added on to the subtotal. I knew from what was printed in the menu that an 18% gratuity is automatically added for parties of six or more. I called our waiter over to give us an explanation; his response was shady and unclear. I obviously wasn't satisfied so he had the manager come over to explain it, which he did in an even more shady manner. He said something to the effect of "Just subtract the tax from the subtotal and the gratuity comes out correctly." When I didn't buy that explanation either, he said "The computer says 19.67% but if you add it up it's 18%."Anyone with a pea-sized brain would see through the manager's pathetic and feeble attempt to justify the arbitrary 19.67% gratuity. I literally had to punch out the numbers on a calculator in front of him just to show him what 18% really amounted to. He took the check back to "check it out." When he returned, he said he took out gratuity so that we could give however much we saw fit. He didn't even give a simple apology; a "sorry about that" would have sufficed. Needless to say, I left muuuch less than 18%. If you end up siding with the majority opinion here (which I find shocking), at the very least do a double-take when you get your check. I didn't think there could be such shady behavior at a somewhat upscale restaurant, especially in the South Park area, but I was clearly proven wrong.P.S. Fun fact: "yama" in Thai means "don't come." Take that as a warning :PI'm really glad to see new sushi places like this one popping up on the map in Charlotte.   It used to be the same old places, but now with the competition moving in people will have to up their games to compete.Know your roll.... I only tried 2 rolls during my first visit here last night, but they were delicious and very filling.  The menu had a lot of other rolls to try that sounded super yummy so I have a feeling this place will not get old fast with the variety of rolls offered.  The menu also had a lot of sake - which I could totally go for on a weekend.. not when I have a deadline to beat on a Friday (the following day).Our server was very nice and was patient with us since we were a large group and did not all arrive at the same time.  Making reservations for the group, and it was just a quick, painless (less than a minute) phone call.  I did feel a little funny since the phone is quickly answered with a quick "yama" and I found myself stumbling over my words, but I managed to get my gears turning and the words finally came out coherently.   Overall... this is my "sushi-go-to" place for the time being.Yama probably has the best sushi in Charlotte. Their waiter and waitress are soo nice, and they don't forget about you, even when their super busy. I love their Tempura Ice Cream, which is to die for! And their price range is pretty average, but for good sushi like their, I would say their price is very affordable! This place is SUPERB!fresh fish, a very good selection of sake, and a very knowledable owner. this place is great for business meals, family gatherings, and when you want some good Japanese food!
Manna Mediterranean=My top 3 budget meals in my Henderson 'hood (no particular order):- Manna - eg Gyro + fries or salad + drink + tax for less than $10- Gata Thai - $6.95 lunch combo served daily 11 am - 3 pm- Village Pub - steak + happy hour booze is a bargainService is always friendly here and I've enjoyed the 2 dishes I've tried so far.  Looking forward to trying more.I've made it my personal mission in life to seek out and try any and all Mediterranean restaurants in any town I live in. I finally made it out to Henderson to try this spot, and I have to say, despite the friendly service, the food sadly wasn't worth the trek.Standard gyro is meaty, and the tzatziki sauce is a bit different than usual- did not seem to contain any cucumbers? There is a lunch option to add on fries and a drink for an affordable price. The side of dolmades (grape leaves) tasted a little off, as if perhaps they were out of a jar. Filling texture was gummy and off-putting, and there was a strong, bitter after-taste that lingered uncomfortably that I haven't encountered with other versions.Service was polite and the location is clean, but pricing is all over the place: $6 for a gyro is great, $2 to add on feta is a little absurd. I wanted to grab some falafel as a side, but the appetizer order is over $5. I think the odd pricing is why most reviewers (myself now included) only recommend the lunch special.
Jack In The Box=I'm well aware that Jack In The Box is by no means a purveyor of healthy and innovative culinary creations.  But unhealthy as the food may be if eaten on a daily (or even weekly) basis, I don't see much harm in occasionally succumbing to my latent junk food addiction.  Whenever I'm in the mood to throw caution to my waistline while holding tight to my wallet, JITB is invariably the first place that comes to mind--at least so long as it's been a respectable 3+ weeks since my last visit.Setting aside the broader debate on the extent to which fast food may or may not be to blame for all that is wrong with America today, those of us who do at least occasionally frequent what I like to euphemistically term "accelerated dining establishments" are sometimes faced with important choices about where to fill up on empty calories.  For a number of reasons, I think JITB stands above the rest.  First, JITB serves both breakfast and lunch/dinner at all times, so if you arrive at 11:30 am in search of a breakfast sandwich, you won't be stuck getting a burger instead.  Second, JITB always seems to have new and interesting menu items.  Third, and most importantly, the Ultimate Cheeseburger is always delicious.As for this particular location, I've been twice.  Both times, I found the employees to be the friendliest and most courteous I've ever encountered at a fast food restaurant (though the people working at the KFC/A&W location on the corner of Baseline and Central are similarly deserving of praise), and everything I've tried has lived up to my memories of what JITB should taste like.  If at all possible, though, I suggest eating on-site or in the car instead of waiting until you get home, as the food is never quite the same again after those first few minutes pass.
Victor Hugo=A less than enjoyable Sunday brunch was had here recently, and it was enough to make me reevaluate my enjoyment of V.H.As a deli, it's great. As I've said before, there's a plethora of meat, cheese, vinegars, oils. They have a good, varied and unusual range of savoury foods for lunch and dinner every day; so if you were needing a tasty dinner option, didn't want to cook, but still wanted home-made meals, pop in here for a reheatable delight. Seriously tempting stuff. Their cakes are also scrummy.But this is all for takeaway. To sit in I really haven't ever had a 'lovely' expereince. Y'know when you want Sunday brunch, you want to cosy up somewhere for an hour or two, deliicious food, the paper, warm and cheery enviornment? Everytime I've sat in, the staff have seem a little flustered. The girls are all lovely, but there generally seems to be an air of subdued panic. Most recently, the boy and I came here. His order was taken and I wasn't asked what I wanted. As a result, I ordered seperately, and my food came out 10 minutes after his. So he'd finished his soup (which was delicious) and sandwich before mine arrived. When it did, the order was wrong. I'd asked for eggs benedict without hollandaise (I can't stand the stuff). It came with hollandaise. I saw the girl write down 'without' on the tab, so it must have been a misread in the kitchen. It was duly replaced with a fresh one. Fine. But this, on top of my order being taken seperately and arriving later than my dining partner's left me eating it whilst he watched me, without the same shared glow of "mmm isn't this Sunday brunch lovely". It felt more that "right now my food's here, I need to eat it". Yknow?Ok so that was a mini rant. I do still like Victor Hugo's for all the delicious food it provides. But the sitting in experience has always left me slightly jaded, and this particular instance put me off dining in again. A pity really.
Mr Pattie=This is one of the most overlooked Jamaican restaurants in the city (due in no small part to its location), but it might just be the best and most authentic. Raised by a Jamaican mother and having taken yearly trips to visit family there, I'm always looking to replicate the real experience over here and this is one of the few places that fits the bill. The staff is amazing, super sweet and incredibly helpful and the decor, though sparse, is welcoming. There are only a couple seat, so it's definitely more of a take-out place, but it is well worth the trip.The patties are fresh and flaky, served piping hot, and you can also get them frozen or in cocktail size if you're having a party (and inviting me). The roties boast some really delicious curried filling and you can get chicken, beef or goat. Throw in some gizarda and coconut drops for dessert and you'll be more than satisfied.However, the best of the best is only available on Saturdays: the jerk chicken and jerk pork. Holy moly is this amazing jerk! Spicy, sure, but also incredibly flavourful and prepared in a drier marinade than most places use here, creating a jerk coating that really sticks to the tender, tasty meat. You can buy it by the pound, so I would suggest one of each to last the weekend if you're dining with friends. Really, really spectacular.One last mention is that they also stock all the Grace sodas, Ting and even peanut punch. It's the complete Jamaican experience, minus the weather.Words are a powerful thing, intuition even stronger...I had just written my review for Anancy and found myself in the mood for a chicken roti, hmmm, not in the mood to drive, I thought but after reading Kim B's review for Mr Pattie,, I jumped into my car and drive over there!My love affair with chicken roti started when I was 19, my ex is a Trini and he introduced me to this delicious delicacy that I still enjoy and crave to this day!I followed the directions on Mr Pattie's website from Sherbrooke St West, very easy, thank you:) About 15 minutes later, I drive onto Patricia, a little residential street.I walked in and was greeted with a friendly smile and a warm hello.I ordered 2 beef patties, their golden, orangey hue was calling me from their display case and I knew they would be delicious! I also ordered a chicken roti and a Grace pineapple soda.My order was ready very quickly and I hopped into my car to go home.I put my keys into the ignition to go but settled back into my seat to taste a pattie. They were very hot which I like, the pastry was very flaky and the filling oh so deliciously spiced and unlike most places, this pattie was stuffed with filling, no skimpy, thin layer! Mmmm, it was worth the drive! I contemplated eating the other but I was a thoughtful gf and brought it home:)I brushed the crumbs off me and started driving home, my roti tempting me with it's curried aroma teasing my senses.Onto the roti...I got home, opened the bag and took my first bite, oh my god was my first thought! Heavenly! Beautifully spiced, saucy, flavorful, nice chunks of potato and the chicken, beyond tender and delicious! I thoroughly enjoyed every mouthful and I will not be hesitating to drive back when my next roti craving hits me!I can't wait to try their jerk pork and jerk chicken, I definitely plan on getting some to BBQ!Thanks Kim for your descriptive, well written review and thanks Mr Pattie for making your food so delicious!You're sure not going to find a better patty anywhere near Montreal. Got that nice yellow-orange flaky action, well-seasoned (if maybe underspiced; I'm always looking for a little more heat than I can get up here). Really lovely people running the shop. This place is more like a 4 to me, but I'm spoiled from having grown up in the north Bronx, so 5 it is.
Pho Chandler=It's no revelation that Pho Chandler has fantastic tasty Pho, and that its always packed when you go pick up your dinner Pho to-go.What really bowled over my berries was their Pad Thai.  We've all had it somewhere.  I prefer Thai Dressing's version, or even Pei Wei's version to say Thai Rama's.  So I knows whats I likes...The first thing that stood out to me, was the vermicelli noodles.  Much thinner than any other Thai place I've ordered from... and yes, I know this is a Vietnamese restaurant.  Maybe that's the difference... Viet Pad Thai uses angel hair.  I don't know, but I'm going with it.While I momentarily considered it odd, I immediately found it an absolute delight.  And the prep work!  Yes, the prep work.  Everything was skillfully diced.  No chokey chicken pieces here, you know, the kind that are infamous for lodging in windpipes.The taste was there.  The constancy was there.  I was there.  And if I have my way, I'll be there again tomorrow, ordering you know what.  Hey, why don't you meet me at Pho Chandler, and we'll satisfy that Pad Thai lover in you.
S&D Polish Deli=I stopped by this past weekend for lunch by myself.  Having never tried Polish food except for the ubiquitous pierogies, I was keen to sample this unfamiliar cuisine.  Because I can be quite picky about the type and form of meat that I eat, I decided to play it safe and order the meatless platter ($11). It came with the following items: a generous helping of haluski, two potato pancakes, and three pierogies (farmer's cheese, potato/cheddar, mushrom/sauerkraut), as well as sides of applesauce and sour cream for the potato pancakes and pierogies, respectively (see photo).All of the dishes comprising the platter were cooked perfectly, and were absolutely delicious.  The haluski was al dente, and had a nice butter-herb sauce; the potato pancakes were crispy on the outside with a soft, pliable interior; and the pierogies were flavorful and stuffed with filling.  All of them were good, but my favorite was the potato/cheddar, which had a deliciously warm and savory filling that was well complemented by the cool, creamy sour cream.  These were definitely not your grocery store variety Mrs. T's pierogies, which are served at many restaurants around town--these are the real deal!As I was waiting for my lunch to be served, I browsed the store and was intrigued by the wide variety of Polish foodstuffs.  My attention was captured in particular by the pierogies in the freezer (the same ones served on my platter, I presume), as well as the interesting soups in the refrigerator in the back (tripe soup, anyone?).  If you're looking for hard-to-find Polish goods, this is probably one of your best bets around town to find them.  If, on the other hand, Polish cuisine is as foreign to you as it is to me, stop by for a delicious, filling lunch that will provide a great introduction to it!Working just up the street from S&D Polish Deli, I cannot believe it took me so long to get here.  The Deli is a combination of a store and a lunch window, which is perfect.  While you are ordering lunch and waiting, you can pick up any meats or Polish delicacies you could want for dinner!  They also have frozen pierogies that you can take home and heat up for dinner!I came in a week or so ago, and I ordered the spinach and cheese pierogies, which was the daily special.  For only $4, I got 4 pockets of joy.  The butter sauce was delicious.  The inside was 98% spinach and 2% cheese so I would only order these as a spinach lover.  The filling was fantastic, and there was a plethora of it.  I really want to try the farmer's cheese and potato cheddar ones now too.The employees are very friendly, and I look forward to returning soon!
Chili's=HORRIBLE!I will be brief because I would spend way too much time writing on how bad this place is.1. When we asked not to be sat at the bathrooms, the hostess rolled her eyes and pointed to a table behind the 1 she wanted to sit us. After saying once again, "I don't want to sit at the bathrooms please," she huffs and throws our menu's at the 3rd booth and walks away. Normally I would have left but it was the only place open on Christmas Eve night so we had to stay.2. Our waitress, Kris, took her sweet time in getting to our table just so we can order our drinks. I was able to sit down at the table, take my jacket off, get the baby situated, realize the baby needed a diaper change, go and change her diaper, come back and it took her 10 minutes to show up to take our DRINK orders. My husband got a fork where the prong was bent straight up and he had to ask her 5 times for a new fork. She was very slow, fake attitude, and didn't listen to anything we had to say.3. The food....I would have eaten Moist n Meaty dog food and it would have tasted better. Since I wasn't all that hungry, I ordered a Caesar salad and baked potato soup. The dressing on my salad tasted like somebody poured it on the floor, danced a jig on top of it, and scooped it back up to put on my salad. It even looked bad! Caesar salad dressing should look creamy, kind of a pale tan color....this had a dark tint to it and smelled horrible. My husband also got a Caesar salad and he had the same problem. He ordered a cheeseburger that was a hockey puck. The only thing that was good was the skillet dip, the chips weren't even good! They were from the bottom of the pile, broken in a million tiny pieces, most of them were burnt, and salty as hell. We didn't even finish our meals it was so disgusting. Since we didn't have a good experience with the hostess (which we found out it was the manager), we didn't even bother complaining about the food or the service. It was not worth the $30.52 at all. Nobody got a tip and we will NEVER go back there again. STAY AWAY!!
BLT Steak Scottsdale=Holy goodness, this was awesome. Tonight I had a dining experience so amazing that I can't even attempt to be hateful, catty and mean about it. BLT Steak is the best restaurant in the Valley, for realz.The Camelback Inn is a beautiful property and BLT Steak fits right in. The dining room and patio directly faces south on Lincoln, giving you a breathtaking view of Camelback Mountain. This served as a great reminder that I will have to hike my fat ass up Echo Canyon about 50 times to work off all the beef I'm about to devour. Inspirational!The bar has attentive service, stiff drinks and serves complimentary olives, nuts and pop corn with some wizardy spices sprinkled on top. Score - because I like to pre-eat before I sit down and eat. (not being sarcastic)  The servers are great - I think we had a separate food server and beverage attendant, which was fancy and efficient - too things that rarely go hand in hand.But the real highlight was the food. I don't even know where to begin. I'll list everything I ate, and describe it, if I can:Bread with pate: The only thing I didn't like, but I'm not a fan of liver. Not their fault.Moving on...Fresh Popovers with euro butter: The second best bread experience of my life, second only to the GIANT BREAD CART at Le Louis XV, Alain Ducasse's restaurant in Monaco. (An EPIC journey in dining and a must visit for anyone who lives to eat)Hamachi: The freshest buttery yellow tail that ever lived - or lived than died. Whatever - it was dope.Shrimp Cocktail: Holla! Chopped Salad: This was pretty good - but more like a greek salad hybrid. I'd skip it in favor of the...Buffalo Mozzarella Salad: Jackpot! Cheese so soft it melted. Fresh yellow tomatoes, great dressing etc.Filet: The best filet I've had in Arizona, dethroning Maestros and Donovan's, for sure.Ahi Tuna: Rare, plump, buttery, holy shit.Glazed Carrots: I'm obsessed with carrots, particularly cooked ones, and I don't know why. These carrots were off the hook and I almost ate the whole a la carte bowl.Hash Browns: The fact that the hashies came in huge hunks of hash brown pie was pretty awesome and ridiculousPecan Pie: Dope, and ice-creamyFruit Crepe:I  wasn't a fan - too passion fruity for me. But my dining partners dug it.Random Complimentary Dessert Cookies: A nice surpriseSauces: Holy f-ing crap - they offer all these random sauces like peppercorn sauce, horseradish and a mustard trio. Order them ALL even though they are $3 each. Totally worth it!I really liked this entire experience. I left fat and stuffed and happy - and didn't even feel sick or like I had to RUN - not walk - to the bathroom immediately after. Similar dining experiences at steakhouses make me dash for the loo. I know - gross. But you know it happens to you too.BLT Steak 4E, bitches. Seriously.Warning:  what you are about to read may make you want to break open your piggy bank or take a large withdrawal out of your savings account... and likely, you will need to do so to afford to enjoy a meal at BLT Steak.  Read on at your own risk!My fiance and I went on a double date to BLT on Friday night, 2/13 with my parents.  We were celebrating Valentines day a night early, and celebrating the fact that our wedding plans are coming together little by little... this is the perfect place for a celebration!The service was over the top attentive beginning with the valet and hostesses to our server, Matt, and everyone in between.  When I asked where the ladies room was, he escorted me there.  Nice touch.  He also acknowledged our engagement as I told them we were celebrating when I made the reservation.  When we were deciding upon which wine to order, Matt offered to send over the sommelier.  While we didn't take him up on his offer, I was still quite impressed!Since we arrived right on time for our 6:45 reservation, we didn't get to try the "complimentary olives, nuts and pop corn with wizardy spices sprinkled on top" that Jenn H mentioned in her review.  Bummer, cause I love that stuff, but probably good because I had room more for everything else we ordered.I skipped the first bread course but I ate an entire popover - the second bread course.  Divine.  Really.  I didn't realize what a huge popover fan I was until I polished that off!Oh - and I can't go on without mentioning the fact that we had a really tasty smooth and savory bottle of Cabernet that went well with everything we ordered.  OK - on to the apps...I had the raw oysters, my dad had the fried oyster special, and Jared had a spinach salad.  Of course, we shared with my mom as well.  Actually, come to think of it, I think they shared theirs but I'm not so sure I shared mine!We did share our sides, and each one was better than the next... creamed spinach, glazed carrots, and stuffed mushrooms.  To go with those, my parents shared a T-bone steak (cowboy dusted I think), and Jared and I shared a Kobe Ribeye.  It was ahhhhhmazing!We were way full after all of that food, but we were celebrating after all, so we decided to share a dessert which my family allowed me to choose.  I went with the blueberry-lemon merengue.  My dad didn't like my choice, so he requested a chocolate peanut butter mousse as well.  On top of that, they brought us some complimentary espresso chocolate petits fours.Can you say food coma?!BLT was an experience... and I enjoyed every second of it.  I highly recommend BLT for a celebratory meal or dinner/drinks if someone else is footing the bill!Lastly, in case you didn't know ('cause I didn't before I took a BLT business card), BLT stands for Bistro Laurent Tourondel, named after Superstar Chef Laurent Tourondel... and there are several other BLT concepts across the US.We dined here for my birthday on 2/13. We had a reservation and we were seated promptly. We got a very nice table with corner bench seating, so we could sit side by side. Our server was efficient and very friendly. We were served the complimentary chicken pate. Sorry to say, I am not a fan of pate, but it was a very nice touch. Next came the legendary popovers. I understand that these are Chef Tourondel's signature. They were so amazing. We decided to share the crab cake appetizer. It was served with remoulade and spicy coleslaw. I can't say enough about how delicious it was! The slaw and the crab was a perfect combination. It was definitely the best crab cake that I ever have eaten. The best! Since it was my birthday, I went a little crazy with birthday drinking. I had "The Fountain of Youth" which was delicious. Can't remember any of the ingredients, but it's an amazing drink. For dinner, I had the filet mignon. Oh, my. It was perfectly cooked, and so tender and delicious with the right amount of char. I opted for the chimichurri sauce which was SO good. BJ opted for the 3 lb. lobster. Wholly, mother of lobster, it was huge and perfectly prepared. And even more amazing, he was able to eat it all. Well, I helped a bit. For sides, we selected grilled asparagus and a baked potato. The potato was served with add your own sour cream, chives, cheese and bacon. The sides were huge and meant for sharing. Even though we were full, we couldn't not pass on dessert. We had the warm chocolate tart served with pistachio ice cream. Wow, it was so good. Also, they were thoughtful enough to serve this complimentary with a nice bday inscription on the plate complete with candle. How nice. Another thoughtful touch was a letter with the Chef thanking us for dining there and a promise of 10% off on our next visit. Wow, that's sweet!  Also, the complimentary dessert cookies were also very nice!As the other yelp reviewers have mentioned, this restaurant is expensive and best reserved for special occasions. However, my birthday experience here is one that will never be forgotten. It was amazing!!  Thanks BLT!My husband and I ventured up to BLT Steak at Camelback Inn on Friday evening to celebrate our third wedding anniversary, which was two days earlier. We sat inside and our corner table gave us a perfect view of Camelback Mountain at night. Our waiter was super nice and did a great job of suggesting items and answering questions when we had them. There was a seperate server who kept our water glasses full all night - we couldn't take more than two sips without having them refilled it seemed like. My only negative about our waiter was that when it was time for a new glass of wine for me, he didn't check with me first to see if I wanted another glass of the same wine. I think we all know the common saying about assuming things...On to the food...here's what we sampled:Popovers - delicious. I was a bit skeptical about the butter and sea salt, especially since I don't like butter very much, but it was great! Caesar salad - good size and it was one of the best caesar salads I have had in awhile. Crabcake - my least favorite part of the meal. While it wasn't horrible, there was a bit too much celery for my taste and not enough crab meat.Cowboy Ribeye - since it was 22 oz, I graciously told my husband that I would have some of it so he could order it. Now those that know me know that I don't eat red meat because I don't like the taste. But I sucked it up and had some...holy crap, I had a few bites and said, "Wow, this is really good". So that should say something about how good it was. However, my husband did think the outside was a tad too well done, although the meat itself was cooked perfectly. While he liked the ribeye, he did think his steak at SW Steakhouse in Las Vegas was better.Mashed potatoes - is it possible to get divorced over mashed potatoes? I thought we were going to throw it down because one side of the potatoes was just not enough!! They were sooo creamy and delicious. Chocolate peanut butter mousse - we got our dessert for free since when I made the reservation I indicated we were celebrating our anniversary. The dessert was a nice way to end the meal, although the chocolate on top was just a touch too rich for my taste.With tip, our bill came to $162 which we did not think was bad at all for as much as we ordered. Unfortunately we didn't get to sit on the patio or enjoy the view at sunset, but I guess that means we'll have to go back which isn't a bad thing at all!BLT Steak truly is a special occasion restaurant, as my boyfriend and I learned firsthand on Valentine's Day. We arrived at the JW Marriott Resort's restaurant a little early and were greeted by the hostess, who then apologized that they were running a little behind on reservations. Not a problem, since we'd hoped to have a drink in the bar before dinner. The bartender made a good Manhattan for my sweetie and I enjoyed my V-Day special drink, which was a prickly pear-flavored Cosmo. Just a little while later, we were approached by a woman who announced that our table was ready, placed our drinks on a silver tray, and escorted us to our seats. (I love when restaurants go the extra step and take care of your drinks for you. Failing that, I love when my date carries my drink for me.)At our table, we were faced with a terrible decision: order off the $60 special prix-fixe menu or select from one of the many prime cuts of steak on offer. The horror! Fortunately for us, the items on the prix-fixe menu were also available a la carte. We decided to splurge and get the most romantic dish on the menu: the 40 oz. Porterhouse for two, plus a roasted beet salad starter from the prix-fixe menu and sides of creamed spinach and potatoes au gratin. Last of all we selected Roquefort and Bearnaise from the list of sauces. Honestly, there were so many choices in each category and everything sounded so great that it took us about half an hour before we could place our order. Our server was patient with us throughout and never made us feel rushed.Sometime in between ordering our entrees and receiving the complimentary gigantic popovers for which BLT is famous (and rightly so), we were approached by the sommelier who offered recommendations, such as a bottle of DeLille Cellars D2 2007.Our Porterhouse was a massive two inches thick, cooked to the requested medium-rare, topped with a thyme compound butter, and served sliced on the bone with a roasted head of garlic alongside. My first bite of steak practically melted in my mouth, and though they didn't need it, the remainder of my bites were topped with either sauce. Some of the steak seemed to be a bit more done, but that's to be expected when trying to cook such a thick, bone-in cut. I found that I preferred the Roquefort with the more well-done pieces, and the Bearnaise with the rare.The sides arrived in adorable individual Staub casseroles and were also mouth-watering. The gratin was a perfectly arranged layer of potato coins bathed in a rich, creamy, cheesy sauce with a hint of roasted garlic. And the creamed spinach was the best I've had: not too saucy and with the perfect amount of nutmeg.Throughout the meal, the wine paired well and really opened up as the evening progressed. At the conclusion of the meal, however, I realized that the full-bodied wine's flavor had changed to something more, well, saline. In fact, the only note I could taste was salt--and my boyfriend agreed. When Scott came by to check on us, we invited him to taste some of the wine. He declined politely, but when we explained that the flavor of the wine was now off, he poured a small taste off the floor. When he returned he conceded that he could see how we felt it was now salty, and said that perhaps it would have benefited from being decanted. Did we want it taken off our bill? Just then, although we'd declined dessert, our server placed a complimentary plate of brownie-like bites on the table. As Scott was talking, I took a bite and then a sip of the wine. Again, the wine's flavor changed and really enhanced the toffee flavor of the little cake. My boyfriend told Scott that the wine had been fine up until the end--and was again perfect. Still, Scott insisted that we have two glasses of dessert wine, especially since we'd received yet another complimentary dessert plate, this time of chocolate mousse-filled cornets.As we sipped the late harvest Zinfandel and the Hungarian Tokaji, we chatted with Scott and learned that he is originally from Napa. We mentioned that we are from the Bay Area and enjoy going up to wine country. But next time we'll be well armed with his suggestions of wineries to try.My sweetie and I ended up closing down the restaurant, with full bellies and fond memories. Even though there had been some minor imperfections with our meal, the personal attention we received from Scott Larson and the gracious service ensured this five-star review.Oh BLT how I love thee. You are one of those restaurants that my mind wonders to on a hungry day. You are a restaurant that I think about when I want a restaurant with an atmosphere and view of Camelback Mountain. And with your bar and indoor/outdoor seating arrangements, you are the perfect place to enjoy a meal on a warm or cool day.I've dined at BLT twice and I think I will be setting up a sleeping bag and just living there from now on. Most recently, I went last night for my birthday. When asked to pick my restaurant poison for the unbirthday celebration, I didn't have to think twice before saying BLT. I wasn't disappointed. The restaurant was full with people but not overly crowded. Our table was ready upon arrival and situated just by the patio and overlooking the mountains so a perfect mixture of indoor outdoor seating. The service was a bit on the slow side but I enjoyed that since this was a leisurely dinner and not one you want to get rushed. The waiter definitely gave us our time. After beginning with wine (a must at a Steakhouse of course), we were served my very favorite classic starter -- popovers! They were large in charge and full of buttery taste. I could probably go back for the popovers alone. For the meal, my table chose between the classic steak and the sole. I went with the sole and to insert much needed awful puns here...I felt the soul train after just one bite! How do I describe it. Upon taking a bite, I tasted candied pecan. As random as it sounds, it tasted delicious. It was a good amount of sole and due to the heaviness of the sauce (delicious sauce by the way), I couldn't finish it as much as I tried. I know I'll be dreaming about the sole for years to come. Plus, since this is not a restaurant you visit for a random Tuesday night and the dollar signs exceed $$$, I will be dreaming for awhile but it's a good memory to have! Moving on to dessert, we tasted a bit of everything and the cheesecake was tasty. I ordered an apple crisp tart and it was ok, but the entree was definitely the highlight of the evening. The only awkward moment of the night was that since it was my birthday, my table apparently tried to tell the staff three times and put the note on the reservation. But, alas three reminders later, still no birthday candle on a dessert (which was fine by me since I like to avoid the birthday if at all possible but my table wouldn't let it slide.) Finally after one final awkward reminder, just as we were ready to go and plates had practically been cleared, a random chocolate souffle appeared with happy birthday. Still no candle and the moment was kind of over but the thought still counts. So I'd probably say this was a great birthday spot for me since I don't enjoy the birthday candle as much, but if you visit and that's important to you, you may want to get on that as early in the dinner as possible! Now that I am officially full for the weekend, I will never forget my great birthday experience at BLT and I definitely think this is a restaurant you should consider for a special occasion. One last thing -- the mixologist for cocktails is amazing and she knows her bourbon, so if she's working the night you visit, definitely ask her for a special drink!This review is just for Happy Hour:I finally got to try out BLT Steak granted it was just the happy hour menu but I was still blown away.  For starters the prices are no where near the full dinner items so it really makes it affordable to just pop in and see what this amazing place has to offer.  The drink list is huge and again very affordable.  I recommend the mojito very good and just the right mix of tart and freshness.  For light bites I had the Duck Pate with wine mustard which was very good.  It had some nice earthy flavor that the wine mustard really played well with.  I then got the steak tartar which was just phenomenal.  It had a little kick to it and the steak just melted in your mouth and absorbed all the richness of the quail egg.  I can't wait to go back for dinner service.
The Mission=I met the BF for a nightcap at The Mission on Thursday night, and it was such a cool place and had such an appealing menu that I decided to return tonight (Friday) to celebrate my birthday with a small group of friends.  Even though it was kind of last minute, the staff at The Mission was extremely accommodating, and we had an incredible experience.(For those of you that follow my reviews, please note that our birthday dinner at The Mission was quite the opposite of our experience at Estate House in February, in a wonderful way!)I am pleased to say that I did not taste anything I didn't like tonight at The Mission, and I did a fair share of tasting!  Starting with their red sangria, their special frozen mango margarita, fresh made guacamole, incredible salsa (I swear my friends wanted to bottle it up and take it home), scallop entree, sweet potato & potato fries, and milkshake dessert, I feel like I gained a good five lbs at dinner, but I would do it all over again for sure - we had so much fun!  The food really is exceptional and there are still a handful of menu items that I can't wait to try!Sonia was our waitress and took great care of us along with Brian (who runs the joint), and a team of other staff.  Our glasses stayed full throughout the evening and they continued to check on us to make sure we didn't need anything else.  It was crowded with a fun vibe and I am sure we'll be back again real soon as The Mission is a new favorite in the hood for us!So, Gabi did it again!  She somehow found the perfect spot to mingle with fellow yelpers, and MINGLE we did!  I don't know if it was the Coronas or the guacamole, but for some odd reason all of my inhibitions flew out the nicely decorated adobe windows.  I found myself chatting with some very interesting people and thoroughly enjoyed myself.When I first arrived (@5:25pm) there weren't too many people here.  Scott reminded me that it was still a bit early, so I took advantage and GOT MY DRINK ON.  Eventually, a group of blue hairs came in and got the party started (not really, they just sat down and ordered food, but that would make an awesome story, right?!) I saw some familiar faces from past events Julia, Dottsy, & Robert. Sorry, I don't nag my weak memory with last initials, but I also met some GREAT new faces.Thanks, Gabi! I dunno how you do it, but somehow you always do!I should probably give in and up this review to 5 stars but I want to go back and right an update where I use LOADS of exclamation points, so I'll stick with 4 stars for today. That said: !!!!!!!!! and to follow up: yummmm. I stopped by for lunch and sat on the front patio which was perfect since the the sun was diffused, there was a breeze and I could eyeball other people's meals while I waited. My server was Sam who is probably the most gregarious server I've had in a long time. That was great because I was dining alone and he made me feel like I was not a loser. I ordered the Corn Gorditas ($9) and the Taro Fries ($7) and was pleased with both. My only regret was using the fries' two dipping sauces because it numbed my pallate a little in terms of appreciating the nuances of the gorditas, which were a little small for a $9 appetizer but all the same, very complete in their blend of flavors and textures. Then I took my meal to the next level by ordering dessert. I'm not sure "orgasm in my mouth" is a family-friendly term but nonetheless it applies to the pumpkin bread pudding ($6) I ordered. As if pumpkin needed any help, The Mission soaks it in a caramel sauce and sprinkles it with pepitas and pomegranate seeds after adding a heaping scoop of vanilla bean ice cream. orgasm.in.my.mouth. I only wished there were a few more pomegranate seeds tossed on there because their tart juice really contrasted beautifully. I tried not to moan out loud as I ate it. So the Mission isn't cheap, not by a long stretch, but what is created in that kitchen is culinary artwork, and combined with their very friendly staff and cozy atmosphere, I think the Mission is doing everything right.I think for my sesquicentennial review, I've gotten to a point where I'm letting the food direct the show of stars. Sure, we have the servers and cooks as producers, the location as our stage, lighting, sound and supporting staff. But the meal, ah, that is our celebrated lead actor. Without it, all other pieces may paint a pretty picture, but what good is a painting when it medium is missing? The Mission really delivers its lines well. Almost too well. Like Dakota Fanning well. Each plate has a spectrum of flavors--bold and smoky with subtle and delicate undertones of fresh herbs. Each dish is skillfully plated and ready for its closeup. My steak tacos were so intensely flavored, I didn't really dwell on the fact there were but three petite tortilla shells mounded with strips of magnificently grilled flank steak and slices of fresh avocado. And the papas y chorizo, which I ordered as an accompaniment, helped balance the palate yet was still a strong item on its own. Robert M's pozole was as unique as it was flavorful, delicious, satisfying and, ironically, humble. The bread pudding he ordered at the end of meal was, according to him, a premature ejaculation. Apparently, that means it was good, so I'll take his word for that. Those who joined us for this meal seemed to share some of the enthusiasm over the dessert, but I don't eat sweets so will have to believe their accolades worthy. What, pray tell, denies The Mission of the much clamored five-star rating? Primarily, it's the associated fees. On one hand, I was blown away by the sensuous flavors apparent in every edible item. On the other hand, I was blown away upon seeing the bill (especially since I had nothing but water to drink). Does one negate the other? Perhaps. Am I at a place in my life where such a statement rings true? Not necessarily. While my initial response was, I wouldn't likely return to The Mission if it was my decision, I confess that I would, willingly, give myself back to The Mission if only for the sublime sins of doting on sustenance.Since The Mission is getting ready to celebrate their one year anniversary, I figure it's time for an update.  I went in for my first visit last November, shortly after they opened, and I've been in countless times since.  The atmosphere is amazing, the staff welcoming, the food unique and tasty... oh, and the drinks go down easy too!The Mission has become Jared's second home - he's there much more than I am!  I go for an occasional drink or dinner.  My favorite menu item is the tableside prepared guacamole.  It's fantastic!  I am also a huge fan of the white bean puree, the street corn, and the salmon.  I wish they had some lighter options on the menu though - just a suggestion on behalf of those of us that are health-conscious!If you enjoy Latin-inspired fare, for sure go check out The Mission... Or at the very least, go in for a drink and some guacamole.  Look for Jared at the bar when you're there!I"ll for sure be excited to celebrate The Mission's one year anniversary in late October.  I'm sure it will be one helluva party!  It always is at The Mission!I want to love The Mission. I really do. The decor is awesome and the margaritas ROCK! But, the food is not doing it for me and I'm so disappointed! I have had the guacamole and I thought it was fine but nothing so special it should be three times the price of guacamole anywhere else.The cheese plate, on the other hand, I'd say that's where it's at  - the cheese portions were fair and the grilled pan de yuca was warm, soft and delicious!The pozole was good but while I thought it was cute that the "heat" came on the side (you add your own serrano and garnish) I would have liked more of the flavor to come from the kitchen. I actually have to say I did NOT like the mahi mahi tacos and it had nothing to do with the size (they ARE small - the tortillas can't be more than 4 inches in diameter but the filling portions are generous). It was the fat little fish sticks that served as the filling --  all I could taste was the batter! By my second taco, I was trying to pick the batter off and come the third - I just gave up and left it in hopes of enjoying dessert.Dessert was good - I had the churros on the recommendation of the many Yelp reviews I had read and they were OK. I actually preferred the fried bananas - more specifically, the peanut butter mousse that they were plated with! OK, I was going to give this place 2 stars but I'm going to round up to 3 with a caveat: For dinner, "Meh. I've experienced better." but for sharing a cheese plate, maybe some pozole, a couple margaritas or a romantic setting for dessert with a bottle of wine, it's "A-OK."Table side guac is such an awesomely good idea. They'll make it here as spicy as you want, even throwing in habanero peppers if you think you can handle it. Besides the appetizers I tried the mahi tacos and they were great, baja style, but very, very lightly breaded and fried. We also had the please of trying mini-churros with a milkshake (mmmmmmm), fried bananas, and bread pudding. I'm not a fan of bananas or bread pudding so I'm not a good judge of if they were good or not, but the rest of my table assured me they were.I also really dig the interior of The Mission. It sort of reminds me of the Alamo, although I only ever went to The Alamo once many years ago so my memories could be wrong. However, it has that open, cool, stone feel with tons of great chandeliers and candles hanging around and setting the mood. So, um, check it out and get into the mood.Holy Shit. If 'the mission' of The Mission is to serve the best brunch in town...then...Mission easily accomplished. We went here for the weekend brunch the other day and our socks were completely knocked off by how amazing it was. To start...it's just such a quaint and unique restaurant. The salt bricks...the old chandeliers...the antique furniture...it all makes you feel like you've stept into some fine dining establishment in a South American town.Food was AMAZING. To start the chips were fresh and crispy and the salsa tasted almost like it had just been made minutes ago. We then ordered a Black Bean Arepa with fries and a Cinnamon Almond Waffle. The BBA was delectable...two freshly made thick corn tortillas with egg, cheese, black beans, and peppers...it really hit the spot. The fries were a mix of regular and sweet potato, and honestly are some of the best fries I've had in recent memory. Thin, crunchy and fresh tasting. The waffle was also sent from heaven...drizzled with candied almonds, cinnamon, cream, and topped with cinnamon ice cream. It was basically a wedding of breakfast and dessert in all the right ways. Top top it all off...this all came out to a mere 19 bucks. Unbelievable. Incredible value for your money when you're eating at a nice place like this. You could easily go spend the same amount of money at Denny's for God's sake. It wasn't very busy when we were there and I'm not sure why. I'm guessing this place is more hoppin' around dinner time, and I can't wait to try their dinner menu. You've been warned though...you're missing out big time if you don't try brunch here. If they stop serving it due to a lack of demand, I might just explode like the dude at the end of Big Trouble in Little China. GO HERE. 5/5.I never knew that there could be fancy Mexican food that I loved as much as my local taco truck. I was wrong. Dead wrong. Be sure to order the pork shoulder tacos and a bottle of the Inedit beer straight outta Barcelona!My wife and I were spending time with another couple at old town Scottsdale and we decided to eat at The Mission.  This was our first time here and all four of us were extremely happy that we chose The Mission.  Everything about the experience was awesome.  You must get the table-side guacamole, it was amazing!The entree portions were just the right amount because you'll definitely want to enjoy all the chips and guacamole.  Very yummy!  Plus, the service and drinks were superb.  We were able to get in right away on this visit, but I would recommend making a reservation via Opentable to ensure you get a table.  You won't be disappointed.We are looking forward to going back to dine on the patio again.I am torn between two stars and three stars even though the food was Exquisite.Short Story-Great food but smaller than Barbie Sized but full price.Long Story-I had the halibut that was over maybe two tablespoons of rice and had a delicious tomato sauce poured around it that tasted similar to Campbell's Soup but better because I couldn't taste the tin can and it had a great layered spice to it that was just right. The top of my fish was sprinkled with some crisp taro threads and my petite halibut was cooked to perfection and seasoned perfect. Vegetables were not a part of this meal ($28)My husband had the Chorizo Porchetta it was impressive coming out with a flaming rosemary stuck into it, I noticed that it looked like a petite filet  across the table in the dark but was a pork shoulder and the chorizo (a hard style chorizo) was stuffed into it, the plate had a very tiny dish of white bean puree on the side. I am looking at my measuring cups right now and the dish looked like my quarter cup but the dish of beans wasn't filled all the way so it was less than a quarter cup also vegetables were not a part of this entree ($24) Both of us and the two tables seated on both sides of us thought it was too dark in the dining room you REALLY HURT your eyes trying to read the menu in such darkness no matter how young or great your eyesight is.The tables are too close together so much so that you have to pull your table out of the way for people seated on the bench to get out. Service was casual.Petite proteins, less than quarter cup side with entrees (1/2 cup is correct amount of food) vegetable side not included,full price..I wouldn't mind paying $10 more an entree so we could receive 1/2 cup side portions and a vegetable portion.                               We will not return.Whoa. Oh, and wow. So, I was debating giving this place four stars because yes it is dark in there and yes the tables are a bit cramped and it did get loud.... but..... I just can't. The food was so good that it completely made up for those things. The BF and I went here for my (very very belated) birthday dinner (we had made res's somewhere else on my b day that fell through *cough* monarch *cough* and had to make new plans). So I decided to try something a bit different and go to the Mission. I am very glad I did. The BF and I made open table reservations and were seated promptly when we got there. Our waiter was this funny guy named Derek, who, at first I thought I wasn't going to like that much (I have an aversion to trendy scottsdale people) but turned out to be wonderful and make great suggestions all night! So thanks Derek!The BF and I decided to order a few different small plates to get a feel for the restaurant. We ordered the cola crispy pork belly, the table side guac, the steak tacos, and a side of chipotle honey grits. I also got a Mission margarita. So my margarita comes out and it is really great! I have only had one other margarita that I liked equally. It was extremely fresh and it wasn't made out of that disgusting green sweet stuff that normally makes up margs. I would definitely recommend it (with salt). We then get the chips and salsa. The salsa is really smokey and reminds me of the salsa at Abuelos, if you've ever tried that. I liked it a lot. So the man who makes the Guac came over and asked how spicy we wanted it, and we told him hot. He then proceeded to mix the guac using all fresh ingredients. It was so good! and so fresh! I liked how I could taste each flavor that went in, from the cilantro to the delicious tomato and jalapeno.... it was all good.... also, it had pinons on it, which gave it a cool texture. I have only had one better guac, and that is at Barrio cafe.... We get the rest of the food, and the portions look tiny, but in reality, they are huge because I just ate half an avocado and a bagillion or so chips. The cola pork belly was Ah. Maze. Ing. I have never had anything like it. It's a crispy sweet and spicy pork with peanut sauce in a lettuce cup. It's like thai mexican fusion. It was the best of the meal. The steak tacos were also wonderful. The BF said it was like eating a new york strip in a taco. It was a little sweet and a little savory... all good. The grits were the only part that were just ok. I liked them, they were creamy and different, but I wouldn't get them again. So we had to get dessert, as it was my 'birthday' and Derek recommended the pumpkin bread pudding. Holy crap Derek, you are the man! This thing was one of the most delicious desserts I have had, and definitely the best bread pudding. It's pumpkin bread with a little bit of creme brulee, in a sea of wonderful butterscotch sauce (made from real scotch...mind=blown) with the perfect amount of ice cream and little crunchy seeds for texture. Whoa. Just whoa. All this, and the bill was like 65$... that's wonderful! We could come and not get drinks and not get grits and it would be an affordable dinner, which is the best part, because I want to go back.... like right now.It's been awhile since I last wrote a review for the mission but my love still remains. My two favorite things about the mission are their fresh guacamole and the patio atmosphere. The entire restaurant has this charming old world feel to it and the food and drinks flow with it.I was here shopping in Scottsdale's Old Town just around lunch time. I got hungry so I checked the best place for lunch in the area on Yelp and found The Mission, was highly rated. It was across the street from where I was standing so we headed that way.When we arrived we were able to get a table in the outside courtyard in the front of the restaurant. We informed the waiter we had very little time for lunch. The three of us ordered margaritas with salt at $8 each. They charged an extra $2 for one with Cointreu. We ordered two Almejas Al Vapor stews for $14 each and one shaved Kale salad for only $10. The shaved kale salad consisted of aji amarillo vinaigrette, baby heirlooms, blood orange, goat cheese & marcona almonds. My friend loves kale. The Almejas Al Vapor is a peruvian clam stew, rock shrimp, chorizo, pan de yucca, aji amarillo & roasted corn. I especially enjoyed the unusual appearance and spice of the stew. See my pic. The stew made me want to go to Peru for some more. I have never been to Peru. The waiter was very expeditious in serving us.My total bill for the three of us for lunch was a very reasonable $69 without gratuities and we were all happy with our meals, margaritas and service.If only the service had been more on point, I definitely would have given the Mission 5 stars. The food was fantastic. Every single bite. Drinks were well made too. We had the table side guacamole to start and it was remarkably good. Not sure what they do differently from other places, but it works. I had the Green Chile Duck for my entree and it was one of the best plates of food I've had in a while. It had a sweet, salty, spicy thing going on and was really well balanced. The service, while quite friendly, was inexcusably slow. We waited way too long between courses and what should have taken an hour and a half at most, took close to 3. The restaurant itself is beautiful and the crowd was sharp and good looking. It was extremely busy - especially for a Monday night, so I would definitely recommend getting a reservation.
Gina's Bistro=My second time there was a horrible experience. Gina herself told the waiter to stop telling us what's good for the day's menu and told him "they're young they don't know nothing, don't waste your time on them". We were the first people to arrive and order and the smallest group but our food was last to come out and we began to notice that all the waiters, waitress, and Gina herself was entertaining other customers and left us out. I will never go back there again especially after I have told Gina myself that I did not enjoy the service and she just walked away.A great, family owned Italian bistro with friendly service and incredible home made food at very reasonable prices.The bruschetta is excellent and a refreshing start to the meal.  Loaded with fresh vine ripened tomatoes, EVOO, and a touch of sea salt on perfectly toasted bread.  Perfect start.Any pasta is incredible.  Pastas are always perfectly cooked and finished (the pasta is tossed with the sauce over heat not just poured over).  The veal bolognese is a standout (animal lovers please don't hate me).  A rich tomato sauce, velvety veal, hint of garlic, finished with a drizzle of EVOO and perfectly cooked pasta is so hard to pass up.Prices are very low.  Expect to pay less than $20 per person.Well worth the try.Please read this all the way through.  I'm sorry to be writing this, and I hope that the owner contacts me via yelp.  Summary:  horrible service and bad food prep...probably good recipes though.  My gf and I were so excited to go there tonight for a romantic dinner.  She read about the cioppino reviews on yelp and in the local paper, and we can't disagree with those reviews...BECAUSE WE NEVER GOT SERVED OUR ENTREES!!!We got to the restaurant and were encouraged by all the italian speaking customers; they must know something.  Our waiter told us that they had none of the wines on the wine list, but put it out anyway because their new wine list for their new wines wasn't printed.  A bit quirky, but he recommended a Pinot Grigio and it was decent...so onward.As this was our first time there, we asked the waiter for recommendations and ordered our food.  Me:  fried bread and mozzarella in tomato sauce and filet of sole francese.  Gf:  calamari (recommended by server) and (what else?!) cioppino.  My appetizer was a glorified grilled cheese sandwich; nothing special, but not bad and a huge serving.  My gf's appetizer did not come at all.  We shared and got halfway through my appetizer, when we asked the waiter about her calamari.  He said it would be ready in 3 minutes.  Obviously, they started cooking it right then, and a few minutes later, out came her calamari and my entree!  Her calamari was not good.  The breading was decent, but the squid itself was not.  The dipping sauce, however, was excellent.  This place has some of the better tomato sauce we've had in Las Vegas.  Let's talk entrees:  My fish was raw on the inside.  If you check my profile, I love sushi, but not half-cooked, half-raw lower quality fish.  The francese sauce seemed good, but it was hard to get over the mushy egg-coating and raw inside.  The side of vegetables were excellent, but I'm really starving for something good to say.  (pun?)  We asked about my gf's entree and were told it would be out soon.  About 30 minutes later, we left without getting my fish or her cioppino.  Our waiter obviously let us down.  We spent 1 hr and 20 minutes in there and got a glass of wine each, a grilled cheese sandwich and a bowl of undercooked calamari.  We left $40 on the table and walked out.  Our waiter never admitted a single mistake, nor brought a comp'd glass of wine to hold us during our wait.  In fact, our wine glasses were empty for between 30-45 minutes and still did not get the attention of our waiter.  The owner did not acknowledge a mostly uneaten bowl of calamari and an entree that was sent back.  When we walked out, we passed the owner who couldn't be bothered to even spare us a glance.  This restaurant was not busy.  There was no reason that a table of six, who arrived 30 minutes after we did, should be finishing their entrees when we walked out hungry and unserved.  Also, there was a brand new busgirl.  She was sweet, but had no training and was left to her own devices.  She was the only one who saw our unhappiness, but was obviously in no position to do anything about it.  To quote my gf, "Our romantic dinner turned the entire evening sour."  Thanks for nothing, Gina.*** #300  ***A friend read good things about Gina's Bistro, and suggested we try it together.  Soon after this, I saw that trusted Yelp friends gave high marks to this eatery.  So, my party of four soon assembled to find out for ourselves.  As a result of this visit, I am happy to report that I have added yet another fine Italian restaurant to my list of places for recurrent dining, even though there are enough spots listed already that it is getting ever harder to make this list.  Although this is my favorite cuisine, there is only so much time available to indulge in Italian dining.  So, standards are high.What are those standards?  1) Bread products of whatever type must be good or better.2) An Italian style soup such as Minestrone, Pasta Fagioli, Stracciatella, or Italian Wedding Soup, or something similar like mussels in tasty broth must be first rate.3) A Caesar or Chopped Salad must be good or better.4) Veal must be tender, and rendered delicious prepared with either sweet Marsala Sauce, creamy and cheesy Pomodoro or Marinara Sauce served Parmigiana style, with melted Mozzarella, or a little sour, salty, and tangy served with prosciutto with or without sage Saltimbocca style.  5) Pasta must be al dente and available tossed with a tasty Bolognese, Pomodoro, or exceptional Marinara Sauce, and mushrooms. 6) Available desserts must be well beyond Spumoni Ice Cream.The food at Gina's Bistro passed all qualifying tests.  Warm rustic bread was very good.  Mussels & Vongole in a spicy light Tomato Sauce was an excellent starter.  The Caesar Salad was good and tasty, with a light Caesar Dressing.  A quite tasty side of Spaghetti Bolognese with Mushrooms was prepared al dente.  Veal Saltimbocca consisted of three good-sized medallions of tender veal enrobed in melted cheese over salty prosciutto, bathing in a slightly sour and tangy sauce.  And, desserts included a very good lemony Mini-Cannoli with powdered sugar and drips of Chocolate Sauce, and a large and very tasty Chocolate Truffle also adorned with Chocolate Sauce.Seating was comfortable in an intimate space, with tables covered by burgundy tablecloths.  Service was friendly, efficient, and accompanied by a welcome Italian flair.  Even the Iced Tea was noticeably fragrant.  A nice little jewel in the desert!XXXX-1/2 stars overall!I honestly didn't come here thinking it was going to be THIS good but it was really all that and then some.  You wouldn't think a place located in a mostly deserted plaza whose best outdoor view is of a gas station would be serving such great Italian fare, but they are and it's worth checking out if you're in the neighborhood.As a lot of other Yelpers say, the atmosphere is nice and cozy.  Service was great and I think this was the only time in Vegas where we had a server that was actually from Italy.  But on a side note, how hilariously fucking awesome would it be if he were American and just doing a terrific Italian accent every night?  I would fall off my chair!!I am a sucker for any place that hand makes their pasta and they make a lot of theirs in house with the exception of spaghetti and penne.  The parpadelle pasta was insanely good!!  I had it with a tomato sauce that included prosciutto, mushrooms and 2 HUGE meatballs.  Just to avoid going completely carb crazy, we went with a veal dish cooked in lemon butter sauce and that was delicious as well.The only disappointment for us was the tiramisu which tasted a little weird so we didn't end up finishing it.  But who freakin cares when they're pushing out such terrific, well priced food?  Consider me a repeat customer!I have seen this place on many occasions, but never thought twice about trying them out until I saw the Groupon. Italian isn't my favorite cuisine, but when I'm craving carbs, it's the place to be. We arrived around 6 for an early dinner and were greeted warmly and seated. Our drink orders were taken and our waiter gave us a rundown of all the specials. He then gave us plenty of time to review the menu while he got our drinks and some bread for the table. We couldn't resist digging into the bread and it was fantastically crunchy on the outside and moist on the inside. Just like it's supposed to be. We indulged in quite a few pieces while we decided on what to order. I went with the gnocchi quattro formaggi. My fella got the mushroom chicken and my mom went with the eggplant parmigiana. Our Server was incredibly attentive and friendly, even while dealing with several other tables he was able to keep track of us and make sure everyone always had drinks filled to the brim and bread and butter on the table. Our meals came out quickly. All the pastas are made fresh and you can tell. Excellent textures and flavors. We all enjoyed our meals immensely and portions were quite generous. We all had leftovers packaged for later as well. Outstanding service, we were quite happy with our meal, I'll definitely be back to check them out again. They even gave us a 20% for our next visit, which is awesome. They'll accommodate just about any request and mentioned that if you are craving a particular type of pasta, just call them a day in advance and they will be sure to have it ready for your next visit.It was back to Gina's Bistro again over 7 months after my introduction to it.  Amazingly, the same server greeted me warmly and said he was placing my party of four at the same table as last time, and me in the same seat--which he correctly did.  He also accurately remembered what I had ordered on my one previous visit.  Eerie but great memory!  Soon after we were comfortably seated in the rather cozy, romantic dining room, and ordered several dishes, the food began to arrive.Very good lightly battered Calamari Fritti was presented with an aioli, just as I requested, followed by a large and excellent homemade cheesy Caesar Salad with fresh Romaine leaves, and Cozze e Vongole in Guazzetto, mussels and clams in a spicy tomato broth.  There was a nice balance of 6 clams and 6 mussels, and the fairly thick broth was good enough to substitute for soup.Excellent al dente spaghetti was next served with a tasty Bolognese Sauce mixed with crunchy mushrooms as a great side.  This was a fine accompaniment to my chosen entrée of Vitello Piemontese, tender medallions of veal bathed in truffle oil and topped by Gorgonzola Cheese in a reduced sweet Brandy Wine Sauce.  The veal was well pounded, fork tender, and cheesy, and the sauce luscious and silky.  We did not order dessert but received a bevy of varying complimentary chocolate-covered strawberries anyway, including ones covered by sprinkles and nuts.Except for having to ask twice for water, meal service was excellent.  After a friend's bowl of leftover Marinara Sauce had been mistakenly tossed out rather than placed in a takeout box, the chef quickly prepared and presented a full order replacement without charge.  And I received a 10% discount off the entire bill after showing my La Voce card.I knew after my initial visit that this ristorante had great potential, and this time it fulfilled its promise.  My fellow diners and I enjoyed a 5-star experience!This time a star was lost--by partly burned Bruschetta with fresh diced tomato.  Being told by our server that charring the Bruschetta somewhat was intentional in order to make the dish authentic was unconvincing and not at all believable--especially since I have not encountered blackened or partly burned Bruschetta anywhere else before or since.  A cool Chopped Caesar Salad with tasty and crunchy homemade croutons, on the other hand, was very good.  And, a hot bowl of Minestrone Soup was a superior rendition of this Italian mainstay, with carrots, spinach, carrots, tomato, peas, celery, onions, and Cavitappi in a tomato-based broth.  Fettuccine Alfredo was creamy and great in texture and taste.  But, although Veal Piemonte featured well-pounded veal, it was warm rather than hot, and had a slightly stringy consistency to it..  Service was very good, but bread plates were inexplicably removed early from the table.A true Italian loving Las Vegas living the American Dream. Riccardo is the owner of this quaint little traditional Italian restaurant. From my experience in Europe, this is almost atypical of the family dining experience in an Italian restaurant. Family recipes, cooked by (or at least supervised by)  the owner represent the ballast and hallmark of this restaurant. Riccardo bought this restaurant (From Gina) in 2012 and brought his third-generation restaurant experience with him from his birth-home of Genoa, Italy on the coast in Northern Italy near the border of Switzerland and France.This restaurant and the owner of this restaurant are a significant contribution to the Las Vegas culinary scene. This is a unique offering amongst copies of copies. The food is as authentic as the air you breathe, being recipes handed down from generations. There are few independent restaurateurs in Las Vegas who can offer such a wonderful dining experience. This is one of them at the very top of the quality scale. A superb wine list accompanies the superb dishes. A white tablecloth red wine pink sauce experience.Expect to spend $80-100 per person, order appetizers and soup and salad plus the entree and get to-go for the leftovers.Ask about the "7 day discount". "Io sono affimatto" (John Pinette)Even with as long as this place has been around, I have never heard of it. We were up in the Boca Park area craving Italian food and decided to do a quick search. Gina's popped up just a bit away, and luckily it was at a time we could go eat there since they have such limited hours. Open only 5 or 6 hours per day throughout the week for dinner, this restaurant has fairly limited seating and per the website suggests reservations. When we walked in on a Sunday around 7pm, there were only a few tables taken and we got seated right away. There's not much in the restaurant besides tables and a small waiting area, but it's a dark and intimate setting that would make for a great date night. About the only downside to the location is that their bathroom is "outside". You have to walk out of the restaurant into a separated bathroom area, similar to how some gas stations are set up.After being sat, we were greeted by Riccardo, who I believe is also a part owner. If you can't tell by his accent, he is from Italy and has a lot of experience in Italian cuisine. He explained some things on the menu and when I questioned him on a few choices I was considering, he suggested my secondary choice of the Strozzapreti alla Norcina. The dish which he said is extremely popular in his hometown features hand rolled pasta with a sausage ragu in a cream based sauce. Similar to a dumpling like texture, the strozzapreti noodles are thick and were cooked perfectly. Being that they're hand rolled, there's a small section in the middle that acts almost like a bowl for the sauce. Their cream sauce is light, but has great flavor and has a hint of truffle oil in it as well. With the sausage mixed in, it's makes a perfect combination for a very meaty and flavorful pasta dish. We also ordered a piece of their NY style cheesecake to share, and were pleasantly surprised. Sticking with the same theme as the rest of their menu, the cheesecake is made in house and was extremely tasty. The crust was a nice thick and buttery graham cracker that wasn't too hard and added perfect texture. The cheesecake itself was rich and it didn't have that chalky or pasty type of texture you find at a lot of restaurants. Drizzled lightly with chocolate sauce and fresh whipped cream, I'd highly recommend a slice to finish out your meal.Alongside excellent service and food, the prices here aren't one bit questionable for the quality. I noticed some other reviews suggest that you'll be spending a big chunk of change, which might be true if you're ordering apps, drinks, desserts, etc. But we walked out of there for just a little over $60 including tip. Not even taking into consideration the area, that's a price I wouldn't hesitate paying over and over again. Personally, I'm nowhere near finishing off my long list of Italian restaurant bookmarks, but if you're looking for a solid and authentic Italian meal, check out Gina's Bistro...you won't be disappointed.Items Selected:Bread, Butter, Olive Oil, BalsamicArancini - Arborio rice filled with bolognese sauce, peas, and mozzarella, breaded, fried and served hot w/marinara sauceAntipasto Italiano (for 2) - Prosciutto Parma, salame, cheeses, and olivesMelanzane alla Parmigiana - Oven baked, breaded eggplant w/marinara sauce and mozzarella served w/side of angelhair spaghetti in marinaraPollo alla Parmigiana - Breaded chicken baked w/ marinara sauce and mozzarella cheese served w/side of angelhair spaghetti in marinaraGnocchi ai 4 Formaggi - Potatoes & flour dumpling in a four cheeses sauceStrozzapreti alla Norcina - Priest choker' elongated hand rolled pasta, fresh sausage ragu in a tomato cream & truffle oilZiti alla Salsiccia e Mozzarella - Hand Rolled Ziti w/ Italian Sausage, Baked with tomato sauce and mozzarella cheeseDouble Espresso on IceTiramisuCannoliTucked away on South Durango in a small shopping complex, just like many local gems that those merely visiting Sin City will never even know to exist, Gina's Bistro is one of those mom n' pop places I'd passed by a hundred times before finally deciding to stop in and touting "authentic Italian recipes" amidst a setting that vibes of an older couple's home the experience is one of well crafted food at a good price, while service ranks amongst the very best in Vegas...and bearing mind the city in which we live, not in a 'damned by faint praise' way.Truly the sort of place where 'dining out' feels much more like 'eating dinner in the house of an old friend,' a visit to Gina's Bistro first sees the glint of a small kitchen tucked behind the hostess stand and quickly seated at a cozy four-top flanked in old photos and paintings it was mere moments before water was poured and perusing the menu while chewing crusty bread served alongside butter, olive oil, and balsamic a list of several specials was recited, a simply grilled fish atop orzo tempting though the housemade pasta inevitably got the nod.Treated to soft Italian opera, the volume appropriate to shroud conversation without ever trending loud, it was not long before a duo of appetizers would arrive and although I personally would have not ordered the $19 Antipasto given the unexciting options, both the prosciutto and olives proved pleasant and sharable while a somewhat undersized duo of arancini proved far more interesting, though a bit more melted cheese and less ground meat would have certainly been preferred.Moving on to entrees, an order of five proving a bit aggressive for just three diners when taking into account bowls of angelhair served with both plates of parm, it was with share-plates replenished and bread relinquished that a vast tasting began, the hand formed gnocchi a bit overcooked and sticky beneath rich cheese sauce while both ziti and priest-choker pasta were prepared perfectly al dente with no lack of flavor from housemade Italian sausage to be found.Having already noted the duo of plates served 'alla Parmigiana,' it was perhaps an unfortunate choice to do both items on the same day alongside so much other food, for as good as the baked eggplant iteration was with a light breading overlying the baked vegetable and bold tomato sauce draped in cheese, the thinly pounded chicken was almost entirely flavorless beneath the same accoutrements, a slight oiliness reserving me to only a few bites, though by the end of the meal the plate - like all the others - was clean.Limited in sweets, the options comprising small, conservative classics with $5 prices perhaps a bit much when compared to other similar spots in the city, it was a single cannoli with surprisingly delicate filling that joined an equally light tiramisu alongside coffee, and chatting with friends as a few more locals filtered in to half-fill the seating one really couldn't help but see the pride in both the maitre d' and waiter's faces as they circulated the room warmly welcoming each guest, water refilled for the umpteenth time without request as lit candles were placed at the center of each table.Setting aside the fact that many of the classic plates are made using store bought dried pasta, and focusing mostly on what the mother and nephew team is doing in house, Gina's Bistro is the sort of restaurant unlikely to wow but happy to please, the service and setting "Un-Vegasy" in the best of ways while the food is often times quite good, particularly considering the price.
Blu Burger Grille=If I could give them NO stars, I would.We have eaten at the BluBurger location on Jomax and had a great experience.  Good food, decent service, no complaints., so when a new location opened up around the corner from our house we decided to check it out with our neighbors and their 2 kids.I arrived first and went to put our name in for a table but instead I waited.  And waited.  And waited some more.  The hostess finally came over and when I requested a table for 4 adults and 2 kids, she let out a sigh and told me that they were completely backed up and could not seat us.  Confused, I scanned the dining room and counted no less than 4 empty tables and 3 teenaged waiters milling around aimlessly.  Dude, the hostess hasn't even met my neighbors kids yet and she was already throwing us out!  At this time, the rest of my party arrived and I let them know what the hostess told me.  My husband walked over to her and asked why she wouldn't seat us mentioning the open tables.  The hostess told us that they were short staffed and backed up in the kitchen but she will seat us anyway.  She also added that we would get no service, not even water, for 20 minutes or more.  WTF.  I have never in my life encountered such a thing in any restaurant - especially one that was newly opened, the smell of fresh paint still in the air.  Certainly not the way to treat potential customers.  Instead of sticking around and starving, we all ended up at Pei Wei a few steps away.Apparantly we weren't the only ones annoyed with the rudeness of BluBurger.  Within minutes of us sitting down at Pei Wei, 3 other groups from BluBurger walked through the doors.  They got tired of waiting as well.So, can't comment of the food at this particular location but the attitude that we got there was so atrocious that we will not be going back.  Ever.I'm hoping that someone at the Health Department reads this and is as alarmed as I am about what I witnessed at BluBurger last night.I was sitting at the bar and ordered a cheeseburger with no add-ons - so no lettuce, tomato, any of that jazz. Literally within three minutes of placing my order the bartender put a plate in front of me. Surprised by the speed but not thinking much of it I ate a couple of sweet potato fries, then noticed that "my" burger was awfully dressed up. I lifted the bun up with fingers I just wiped my runny nose with (I know, I'm totally gross but I thought it was my food) and saw that it was not what I ordered. At the very same time the bartender came hurrying back, saying she accidentally gave me someone else's order.As she whisked it away I explained that she'd have to make it over again because I already touched it and I have a cold. She kind of laughed and brought the plate back to the kitchen window. I watched while the cook did nothing more than put the big toothpick back into to bun and sent the contaminated plate out to the unsuspecting diner.I don't know if the bartender didn't tell the cook what I said about already touching it and having a cold, or if neither of them cared. What I do know, however, is that is really, really gross, and if I knew that I was eating someone else's snot germs I'd barf.So if you ate at BluBurger last night and you develop a cold this weekend, now you know why.
Buffalo Wild Wings=My husband & I have been avid BWW goer's ever since we moved to Gilbert 3 years ago. We frequented the McQueen & Elliot location almost once a week the entire time we lived nearby.  The wings are awesome and it's the best place to watch any kind of sports. Every time friends come in town we take them to Thursday night $.50 wings & $3 you-call-its. We have since moved to East Mesa and last night two good friends where in town visiting. We were on our way home when they asked about BWW and said they had been really looking forward to making a trip there while they were in town.It was 12:30 am and we were driving nearby this location. I wasn't sure what time they closed so I looked up the number on my phone quickly and called to ask. Someone answered the phone and said "we close at 1." We knew we were cutting it close but were craving wings so we decided we would run in, order wings togo, have one round of drinks while they were being cooked and make it out right at closing. We have all worked in the service industry so we are very cognizant of common restaurant courtesy and always tip extremely well.When we walked in we were immediately faced with the manager, Shana I believe, who very rudely said "we are closed." My husband looked at his phone and said it is only 12:40 and we just called and someone told us you close at 1. She said she was indeed the person who answered the phone and her clock actually said it was 12:55 and they are closed. We explained our intention of ordering togo and having one drink and she again very rudely  said the bar was absolutely off limits they did last call 20 minutes ago and if we HAD to order food it we would be waiting for awhile because she would have to "refire" up the kitchen and get everything back out since its all been cleaned up already. At this point we had no intention of staying and were really offended at how we were being treated. We calmly explained we would have appreciated if she had been truthful with us on the phone. If she had simply replied that they close at 1 but the kitchen has already cleaned up and last call for the bar was 20 minutes ago we would not have even wasted the time to drive there. She did not apologize and was still speaking to us with a ridiculous attitude. Everyone was frustrated at this point and as we started to a leave a server that had walked up earlier called my husband an "asshole". This was completely appalling, so unnecessary, absolutely undeserved and insanely unprofessional. We will NEVER go back to this location, if you are craving BWW stop in to the McQueen & Elliot location where all of the staff are super friendly, accommodating and professional.
Sunrise Coffee=Yay! I FINALLY made it here to have lunch! I am such a lazy slacker that the 5 mile drive from work has been holding me back.  But SO glad I finally went.Got the Yelp special mocha frappe (vegan, with soy).  Awesomeness points - they don't charge extra for soy (or rice) milk! (You can also get almond milk for a bit extra.)Ordered the tofurkey sandwich (veganized - tofurkey, vegan cheez, tomato, spinach, red bell pepper, hummus on whole grain bread) and my friend got the An Alien Left a Burrito in the Middle East (hehehe), veganized - spinach tortilla w/ beans, vegan cheese, hummus, couscous, and veggies.  I had a bite and it was nummers! I'm gonna get that next time for sure. They also have a black bean sandwich (not veganizable) and breakfast items (can't wait to try the breakfast burrito!).  Reasonably priced coffee drinks, lots of teas (including a very tasty local organic "Summer Orchard").Very friendly staff, and we got our food and drinks really quickly.  Was surprised at how inexpensive it was, bonus! Looks like it would be a fun place to hang out with a few friends on one of the sofas (they had several board games). The only disappointment was the vegan brownie; not bad -- just tasted too "healthy."  Guessing it was sweetened with dates? Which is cool if you're looking for natural sugar, but I like my vegan desserts to taste like junk food. :)Will be coming here on the regular from now on!First time here and writing this review chillin' inside Sunrise Coffee right now.  Couldn't wait to write a review because I just had the best effing egg croissant in my life right now!  At first I was like wow $5 fro a breakfast sandwich and the moment I took my first bite I was like oh sh*t, this egg sandwich is hella good.  The croissant was soft enough that it just melts in your mouth,  Egg was scrambled just right.  It came with avocados and tomato and something that I have never had or seen before in a sandwich. It wasn't lettuce but instead leaves.  Yes, like leaves on trees.  Anyone that has been here before know what these green leaves are?  Reason I'm asking is I'm going to attempt to see if i can make a sandwich similar to this at home.And oh, they serve coffee as well, haha.  Free WiFi too along with good music in the background because any place that plays nightmare on wax is a def' thumbs up in my book. They do spoken words (open mic poetry session) I believe every monday night from what I know of before, but I don't know if it still goes on as of now.Aight ya'll, back to studying.This place is AWESOME!  Aside from the fact that it's one of those rare-in-Vegas artsy-farsty bohemian hangout-type coffee shops, with bookshelves full o'crappy old paperbacks and lots of comfy seating...it also serves A*M*A*Z*I*N*G food! I had the "Aliens Kidnapped a Burrito From the Middle East" and it was nothing short of jaw-dropping! Crammed full of healthy shit like fresh spinach leaves, avocado, couscous and hummus...very hard to find quick, healthy eats like that, and it was only $5.99. I will DEFINITELY be spending more time here. It's become a destination thing for me -- if I ever happen to be in that part of town, I will make a point to go there. It was that good!! I can't say enough fabulous things about this place!!We're in the desert people.  This ain't Seattle.  And with the lack of cold and wet comes a lack of inviting public (indoor) spaces to sit and talk, sit and read, or sit and work--otherwise known as the local coffee shop.  Which is the part of the reason that I am such a huge cheerleader for Sunrise Coffee and tell everyone that they should drive to Sunrise no matter what side of town they live on.  Sunrise is one of the only independent coffee shops in Vegas.  And they've done a great job making a caffeinated space to inspire creativity, wakefulness, conversation, and community.  It's a space that's rare in Vegas.  But it's also an inviting space with the options of comfy chairs, tables, outlets to plug in a laptop, and at least one larger table for a group meeting.Beyond the space, Sunrise offers great coffee (organic, fair trade, and well-roasted), delicious steamed milk coffee drinks (one of the few places in town offering a cafe au lait and Mexican hot chocolate).  And if you want a healthier breakfast option or vegan food options, they've got you covered.  Bottom line: I'm in love with Sunrise.  It's proof that we can have the sun and outdoors of the desert and not give up the cozy nooks and tasty warm drinks of the colder cities.My ultimate favorite coffee shop! REAL coffee, none of that watered down starbucks stuff and i'm not a starbucks snob at all, this place is just better..in almost every aspect haha. I'm not even really an avid  coffee drinker but their coffee actually has a delicious, rich flavor and even gives me the caffeine I need (gives me a better boost than 5 hour energy). You can also pick up a bag of their mothership coffee for home :)My favorite to get is their iced truffle berry. It's raspberry chocolate flavored coffee and wow it's just soo addicting! I also enjoy their smore, butter beer (sounds weird but trust me, it's amazing), white mocha, mint mocha, caramel, creme brulee and well, I guess all of their flavors haha! Everything I've tried has been great including their nomnom and alien burrito! I'm not vegan or vegetarian but those burritos were soo good that I don't feel like I'm missing out on any meat. They also have a great selection of teas and pastries. The prices are great as well! My large iced truffle berry is under $5 and they also offer a "happy hour", I have to double check what time it starts though, sorry! All of the workers are really friendly, and 95% of the time has been pretty fast. The inside is very cozy, and they also have a little outdoor seating area. Sometimes it's hard to find a spot because a lot of people like to bring their laptops and work but it's always nice just to to-go and have a picnic across the street at sunset park. I just love this place :)Sunrise Coffee is a golden ray of blissful warmth to get you moving in the right direction!Sunrise is a local coffee house that excels at customer service while offering a nice selection of quality options.They are probably best known for their Mothership Roasters Coffee, but they also have several good loose leaf teas that are sure to please. I also look forward to enjoying one of their tasty wraps. The Alien (Left a Burrito in the Midwest) is my go-to option.  It's a vegetarian option that leaves me satisfied and never missing meat. The Alien consists of a tortilla wrap with couscous, beans, cheese, hummus, spinach, tomato, avocado, and red bell pepper. If I'm not eating eating the Alien I am probably enjoying the similar Nomnom Breakfast Burrito featuring a tortilla, eggs, vegetarian beans, potatoes, cheese, fresh spinach, tomatoes, avocados, sour cream and a bit of cream cheese. The real beauty for me is my wife! Having breakfast with her is divine on its own, but one of her numerous positive qualities happens to be her generosity. At Sunrise Coffee it pays dividends as bites of what she's eating--normally the Multigrain Egg Sandwich. I would order this from time-to-time if not for the fact that I get to enjoy a couple bites of this anyway due to on my previous ability to woo such an incredible partner.Sunrise Coffee is located on Sunset in a typical Vegas strip mall that does nothing on its own to entice you to its businesses, but once you make it in the door, Sunrise offers a clean and comfortable environment to meet a friend or get some work done. Needless to say it is one of my favorite coffee shops around.When a person leaves a review that is less than favorable for a business, the owners have two choices.1.  They can lash out, and post awful things in response, which I've seen a number of businesses do.2.  They can reach out privately to the customer, and sincerely apologize, (also stating that they will be having a meeting to correct the behavior...)This is how I found myself back at Sunrise Coffee so soon after my visit a couple of weeks ago.  I was less than impressed then, but the day after I posted my review, I was contacted by the owner.  He apologized profusely and sincerely, and stated that there would be a meeting to address what I had referred to as "snarky attitudes."That impressed me.  For an owner to reach out on a personal level, well...that scores big points with me.  Well. Whether it was the meeting, or I just happened to be there on an off day last time, today's visit was night and day. I walked in, and the vibe was better.The shop was packed, but employees were smiling...even the girl who was dealing with a rather difficult sounding customer was super sweet.Service was polite.  Friendly...everything I had expected!The coffee, again, was delicious.  Today I tried the Truffleberry, and wowza, is THAT delicious!I also tried a carrot cake muffin, which to me was a little dry, but had an all around good flavor.  Sunrise, you've 100% redeemed yourself.  I intend fully to visit again, and maybe even sit with a good book or my knitting some weekend.The pour over coffee I ordered was not very good. I think the beans are of lower quality than I am used to and the water may have been too hot when poured. I've been brewing pour over at home for years and that's a mistake I made early in the game. It happens. The iced coffee my wife ordered was not great either. Bitter after taste isn't exactly our cup of tea. My previous review, which I deleted for some odd reason, was pegged by the manager as narcissistic and I was labeled as a mean person hiding behind the internet. To that I will say that I understand the manager of a business wants to support her staff and that's fantastic. More power to you. I see that this business has 4.5 stars so it shouldn't be too difficult to accept that not everyone loves your product. I didnt have a good experience and I am certain that I am allowed to express my opinion because after all, Yelp is an application that is all about sharing. Don't get too upset about that and please read some of my reviews. When I like a business, I gush and give great reviews. When I don't like a business I tell the truth about it and that's something I can't apologize for.Wow. I guess it's been a few years since I've visited Sunrise Coffee. I like what they've done with the place. Much more seating inside and a large covered patio outside.I stopped by because I had run out of coffee beans. When I visited Colorado River Coffee Roasters a couple of years ago, they told me that Sunrise was no longer their customer because they started roasting their own beans. As it turns out, Sunrise will soon open up a separate location for their Mothership Coffee Roasters brand. But for now, you can buy the beans at Sunrise.As I walk in, I see that they have four varieties available, but nothing specifically marked as an espresso blend. So I ask the guy for a recommendation. Long story short, I went with the Guatemala Café Femenino. It's organic, fair trade, and all women farmers? Interesting. Anyway, the latte I made this morning was absolutely delicious. Good job women farmers!A nice touch was that my cup of cold brew coffee was on the house thanks to my purchase of beans. To top it off, their cold brew was perfectly tasty and refreshing.It's definitely nice to have a quality local spot to grab freshly roasted beans. Sunrise Coffee and the upcoming Mothership Coffee Roasters just might be my new go to spots.Items Selected:Strawberry Corriander MuffinBanana Walnut MuffinPineapple Cinnamon RollDrip CoffeeVisited occasionally in the past for coffee en route to the office, but overlooked for pastries as items were previously outsourced, a return visit to Sunrise Coffee was planned the moment rumor was heard that all muffins, cookies, and confections were now crafted by the team at sister-shop Mothership; plans to meet owner Juanny Romero at 9:00am just a mile down the street prompting an early stop that showed the brew as bold as ever while the relaxed vibe and free WiFi offered impetus to stick around and enjoy a trio of pastries crafted with top tier ingredients and balance bolstered by creativity as well as skill.A icon of the local coffee culture since 2008, and as such a veritable forefather to the current scene slowly creeping towards the Strip and Western Suburbs, Sunrise Coffee has long featured the locally roasted Mothership brand of beans and with fanciful lattes, espressos, cappuccinos, pour-overs, and presses available it was instead in a medium cup of drip that I invested, the effect of light roasting readily apparent even in the simplest option as fig and caramel tones coated the tongue,Moving on to pastries, each item individually plated by one of four friendly youngsters tasked with everything from barrista duties to crafting sandwiches from organic produce sourced from a farm in California, the glass case at Sunrise is a bit more straightforward than the counter of Mothership, but with some similarities and a focus on balanced flavors the only question becomes where best to invest one's appetite, the seasonal cinnamon roll a good first choice as caramelized pineapple finds balance in light yeast with the sort of frosting that never seems cloying, but rather a semi-sweet delivery mechanism for the cinnamon and butter tones beneath.Passing on a scone that had previously wowed on Green Valley Parkway, instead choosing to focus on muffins exclusive to Sunrise, it was with bites of the strawberry and  corriander iteration that the tasting progressed, and with a supple crumb and flavors that bridged savory to natural sweetness the follow-up was no less remarkable, the bitterness of dark walnuts proving an admirable foil to overripe bananas as  homey autumnal notes rang through with aplomb.Now perhaps best judged as the casual sibling of brainy sister Mothership, Sunrise Coffee Roasters continues to turn out some of the city's best brews, and for those looking to sit, sip, savor, and perhaps enjoy a sandwich there are few better places to do so in town.LIKES- Very friendly and laidback employees! It feels like I'm hanging out with friends who just happen to make coffee and suck money out of my credit card while doing so- Every drink I have tasted is either good or really good, which is rare since I'm pretty picky when it comes to coffee- Seating and outlets!- Outdoor seating for nicer weather; also dog-friendly- Organized and visually appealing menu- Prices affordable especially for the quality you get- Drive-thru available for those in a rush but I'm sure that can't be fun for employeesDISLIKES- The horrible traffic due to construction- It can get crowded aka lack of seating aka don't come in a huge group (a testament to their popularity)- Closes early (not a surprise for a coffee shop of course, but it's nice to study at midnight sometimes)My personal favorite: Truffle berry latte less sweet! Harmonious blend of raspberry and chocolate.Who needs proper sentences anyway? I decided to just make a list of some things I like and dislike about Sunrise because If i were to go into every detail it would be an essay and I am sooo done with school.
Pan Asia Sushi Chinese Fusion=When my husband and I moved to South Phoenix from the Bay Area, we were used to having Asian food three or four times a week. In an average month, we'd get Thai takeout five or six times, have Chinese delivered, enjoy Vietnamese for a casual lunch, fill up on dim sum on a weekend morning, and splurge on tons of sushi and grilled fish/meat at a Japanese restaurant. Needless to say, since moving to south Phoenix, we haven't had Asian food with nearly as much frequency. Although we have found some great Asian restaurants outside of our area, our options within a 10-15 minute range have been limited to Canton Wong #8 (a good but standard to-go Chinese joint) and Sun Asian Kitchen (a Chinese restaurant that bills itself as fine dining but is low on taste and quality). Enter Pan Asia Sushi Chinese Fusion, which just opened this past week in the new center on the southeast corner of 24th and Baseline. We've been eagerly anticipating its opening but were afraid to get too excited. After all, it could have just as easily turned out as bad as Sun Kitchen. Based on the very generic name, we also feared that it might be some sort of buffet (as if we don't already have enough of those in this area!). Well, we tried the restaurant last night, and it totally blew us away! The place definitely has some kinks to work out - the timing of food service was a bit off (we got our Chinese entree before our sushi), the communication between the bus boys and the servers was a little off, and the menu was a little confusing - but the decor is thoughtful and attractive (we especially loved the crystal light fixtures and the patterned wash basins in the bathrooms), the employees are friendly, and most importantly, the food is freaking incredible! For our main dish, we ordered the Mongolian Beef ($9) off of the Chinese menu. Even though they had some much more interesting dishes (one that stood out was the Crispy Beef with Plum Sauce), we like to start with something simple so that we can determine whether the ingredients used are fresh. Well, Pan Asia passed the test on that count! The beef was literally the best quality beef I've ever had in a Chinese dish - it was tender and super-flavorful. We were left wondering if they used filet! The vegetables were also bright and fresh. Best of all, the brown sauce was spicy - it's rare for a Chinese place to have a brown sauce be spicy by default, but we loved the kick and appreciated that they didn't dumb the dish down for an Americanized palatte. As if the entree weren't good enough, our three sushi orders (Las Vegas Roll, Philadelphia Roll, and the Yama Roll) were made with fresh and high-quality fish, well-rolled (a lot of places don't bother to actually roll the rolls well!), and artfully presented. We especially loved the unexpected touches on the dishes - swirls of eel sauce, dots of mango puree, and thinly sliced scallions. If you're not into the sweeter, fancier rolls, you may want to avoid these rolls and stick with some of the basics on the menu (they have a large nigiri/sashimi section, as well as some simple/more traditional rolls), but we really enjoyed the more inventive rolls, and from the freshness of the ingredients in the rolls we ordered, I imagine that the simpler, more fish-focused sushi items would also be really enjoyable. We are so glad that this place opened in our area - now we can go to one spot and get both high-quality Chinese and sushi! This combination may prove useful for groups or couples with varying tastes. According to our server, a liquor license is coming soon. Since we love cocktails just as much as we love good Chinese and sushi, that's great news! In the meantime, though, we'll definitely be back as often as possible. Pan Asia isn't just good for the area - it's just plain good!Was enticed to have dinner here when one of the owners mentioned that on the 14th and 28th of this month the restaurant features 50% off.  Don't know if this is every month... I thought it would be 50% off everything on the menu, but upon arrival was given a menu with a few items that are 50% or almost 50% off.  I asked her if they use rice wine vinegar for their sushi rice, and she said yes.  I was quite hopeful to see if they've improved on it!The restaurant was busy, and there were at least three sushi chefs busily working the sushi bar.  I usually try to dine at sushi counters of Japanese restaurants, but the seats here are too low for me to enjoy the experience.  Measuring at 5'0", I know I'm a shrimp, but the counter here is too low for ANYONE to be able to watch the chefs in action, so after trying one more time to sit there tonight, I got up immediately and sat at the bar.After studying the menus and asking questions, I finally settled on the Norway Pepper Salmon (reg. $5, now $3) and The Bomb (reg. $15, now $9).  The restaurant was quite busy- it took at least 25 minutes before the two-piece salmon sushi arrived.  The presentation was quite pretty, with an orchid and a couple of sauces (pineapple and raspberry) for garnishes, but the sauces did not add anything to the flavor of the salmon.  I was quite hopeful that the rice would be much better this time- I met another owner, John, who told me that he'd read a review on a blog where the reviewer mentioned something about the rice.  However, the rice tasted just like it did on my second visit.  He did come by to inquire about the rice and said he'd try to find out what the problem was.Since I found "The Bomb" (35 minutes or more wait-time) under the the Sushi/Rolls menu (the description stated "baked spicy scallop with salmon wrapped spicy tuna"), I expected to see rice in this dish, but the presentation was neither in sushi- nor hand-roll fashion, just said ingredients.  No matter- I still enjoyed it- so many textures here!  I loved the plumpness of the scallops.  I particularly liked how they weren't chopped into tiny pieces like I've experienced them in other venues.  I didn't find the tuna to be spicy at all.  It was, however, served tartare-style, and so added another textural component to the dish.  The salmon pieces were beautiful to behold and sliced thick, yet were velvety-smooth on the tongue and melted in my mouth!  Very fresh-tasting; no fishy aftertaste at all.I also ordered the Pan Asia Beefsteak and Grilled Salmon entree under the Chinese menu (reg. $26, now $13) to go.  While I detected cornstarch in the sauces that covered them, I did find the couple of beef pieces, nicely peppered, and the sliver of salmon I tasted to be delicious!  Definitely something worth checking out on the 50% price-plan.  I did find it strange that this entree didn't come with rice, either; instead, orange slices were wedged between the salmon and the beef.  BTW, I was able to taste a little bit of the green tea ice cream served here... it is EXQUISITE!  I was tempted to order some for take-out...  From what I gathered, the dessert costs $6 and is served with a warmed banana, a sauce, and whip cream.  A single scoop will set you back $4.I was sitting at work wondering what the heck to eat for lunch. I hopped on Yelp, popped in my work addy and did a search. After getting a few results, I settled on trying Pan Asia. I hopped in the g-ride and headed over. When I walked in to this strip mall location, I was very surprised. This was modern and sleek decor with flat panel TVs and cool music bumping over head. Wow! I decided to sit at the bar for my meal. I was STARVING so I chose to go with the deluxe sushi combo. I was just drinking water and had to trouble 2 people to finally obtain a lemon for my drink. It was a slight annoyance. When my plate arrived, I was delighted by the presentation. On the platter were 2 pieces of yellowtail , a salmon a tuna, a black pepper tuna and the dish usually comes with 8 pieces of spicy tuna roll, but I asked for spicy yellowtail instead. I was so glad that I was starving! The quality of the fish at Pan Asia is so-so. It isn't bad, but it's not without a bit of aftertaste and certainly isn't the highest quality. Again, you won't get sick, or you won't be horrified by the sushi, it's just middle grade. On my second visit, I got to try the "Fire Roll" which is a California roll inside, sauteed garlic shrimp all covered with eel sauce and Bacardi 151 lit on fire. It makes a great presentation and is very tasty for those who don't enjoy raw fish. I would highly suggest this place for run-of-the-mill sushi. I would especially suggest it for those who are with fellow diners who do not eat sushi as Pan Asia offers a full menu of Chinese cuisine. I know that Pan Asia will become one of my regular lunch spots for a quick sushi fix!
Chima Brazilian Steakhouse=I am Brazilian and this place is a bit overratedLet me start telling you about my background. I am from the southernmost state of Brazil, Rio Grande do Sul, where the authentic "churrasco" is from. While I cannot find a really authentic place here in the US (because they are not run by authentic gauchos from the south) there are many others that can serve a delicious churrasco. Chima does delivers a delicious meal, however, for their price range I am obligated to compare them to other upscale "churrascarias" like Fogo de Chao, Plataforma (NYC) and Texas de Brazil. Chima is probably 4th in the list. I rated them this low because for the price they do charge in Charlotte (because they can) is not compatible with the quality of service and meat variety we get in these other upscale churrascarias. This place is surprising the busiest restaurant in Charlotte and I do see why. Where in uptown you pay $50 and can taste so many different cuts of beef? Exactly! But like I said before, being in other churrascarias I think that Chima is overrated as they are trying to compare themselves to Fogo de Chao, which they are not.It is still an excellent experience if you have never been, but as a Brazilian I rarely go because with the price tag they have, we can have an outstanding meal in other steakhouses around uptown.Sides are nothing too special, fried polentas are good but way worse than Fogo de Chao.Chima also does not open for lunch (except in special days) and when they open for lunch they usually charge $37 however they do reduce the variety of cuts and also their service is not too good. As an example, in Miami, Fogo de Chao charges $30 for lunch and they have the exactly same menu as dinner.They also do not feature chicken hearts (which may sound yucky but it is a must have in churrascarias) and they also marinate the beef with garlic in some cuts which is an assassination to the method of preparing the food. The garlic is to mask the bad taste of the beef cut. A real beef cut is seasoned with sea salt only (maybe some pepper) and not with garlic. There was even a project of "law" in southern Brazil that to be called churrasco only Sea Salt should be used, no garlic, no pepper.Desserts are expensive and not required. In Brazil, churrascarias often don't charge for deserts and you would have a buffet. Some upscale churrascarias charge for it.
Denny's=70+ year old hostess Shelby: "Where does a one-legged waitress work" Us: *Blank stares* Shelby: "IHOP" Yeah... it was one of those nights. I was actually really impressed with this particular Denny's. Both the hostess and our waitress were EXTREMELY nice and accommodating, especially since we were a large, obnoxiously drunken group of people stumbling in after midnight. The food came out quick and correct, my cup was never empty and the booth made for a nice resting place for my head. Thanks Denny's. Without my delicious chocolate milkshake and 2 egg breakfast I would have puked and passed out in the parking lot.Everyone knows what Denny's is and Denny's is no 4 star establishment; however this Denny's gets 4 stars for a Denny's.We stumbled in most of us drunk and obnoxious. We were seated quickly by the funniest hostess ever to work at a Denny's. She began telling us jokes that you can read in the other reviews. I mentioned we needed six jokes hoping we would each have one for our reviews. "Sex jokes or six jokes?" She asked."Six jokes.""Sex jokes?"Six jokes...S-I-X.""You don't spell sex with an I....must have been awhile eh sweetie?"Keep in mind this lady has to be around her 60s.The service was enough to boost this place up but on top of it I was introduced to their buffalo chicken sandwich..and it is good. Seriously I swear. It is still a Denny's though.
Switch Steak=Transformers!  More than meats the eye.  Switch is known for the way the walls change every 15-30 mins.  I kid u not.  Walls come out of the ground up, walls come from ceiling down, the ceiling transforms and the light fixtures change.  I'll have to admit while it does feel like a gimmick, that is one expensive ass gimmick.  Think about the motors and rotors and mechanics to make everything so fluid and change with the beat... On to the food, the more important part.  Summer truffle risotto.  Holy crap those pieces of truffle are large.  With  more mushrooms and sugar peas.  The texture rolls on the tongue and slides into the stomach.   Ribeye is tender and quite gigantic.  Scallops are fresh and bathed in a delightful sweet pea verjus sauce, topped with mushrooms corn and more peas.  The desserts are not to be missed either.  Picture perfect and perfect tasting donut holes and masterpieces of art.Me and my friends were starving and found this place through the list of restaurants that were in hotel. We made our reservation last minute on a Saturday night and the only tables they had were on the patio, which is right next to Surrender nightclub or Encore Beach Club during the day. The patio was pretty and the view of the nightclub and the pool at night was beautiful. We thought it was going to be cold but it wasn't cold at all. Our first waiter was really rude and condescending, I was simply trying to order for 3 people including myself because we all wanted the same entree. But, for some reason he got confused or pretended to be confused to make me feel stupid because there was nothing complicated about it. Then a friend was just asking for his opinion on what seafood to get and he goes ,"You mean you want fish?" He continued to repeat three times, like are you freakin retarded! Fish is part of the seafood family numb nuts. I got fed up with the waiter and as he walked by I said, "I'm going to yelp this!" So why would I give this place 4 stars if we had such a condescending waiter? Well because I guess the guy heard me and they switched our waiters to someone who was super nice and talkative. After our new waiter, we all calmed down and we were as happy as can be because the food was good and our waiter was nice! =) I had the chicken and it was really good, usually chicken is really dry and mine was really moist and flavorful! I tried some of my friends steak and it was also really good!Minus the d bag waiter we first had, the experience here was good!Why Steve Wynn needed two top flight steakhouses in a single resort is beyond me.  Makes choosing so hard and forces a comparison.SWITCH elevates steakhouse dining to an elegant affair.  Plate presentation is very modern; if you eat with your eyes, this place wins over SW.Prices are higher than SW.  The American kobe beef carpaccio is excellent.  It is served Italian style with a parsley pesto, porcini mushrooms, arugula, and Parmesan cheese.  YumI don't usually order seafood at a steak place but had to try the monk fish.  Wow.  Perfect.  The  micro herbs and horseradish just make the dish.The steaks are excellent.  The aging of the corn fed beef really brings out the beef flavors.  The dry aged new york strip is incredible.  Nutty with blue cheese notes.  The NY strip steak flight is also a must try.  You get to try all three offerings of SWITCH side by side.  Its like a mini beef tasting!  Its a lot of fun but recommend you share it.  Sides are more inventive than at SW.  The cauliflower gratin, woodland mushrooms, and switch ratatouille are all good choices and all pair well with the dry aged beef.Service is excellent.The wine selection is vast.  Prices are a little high by Vegas standards.Great restaurant.Switch Steak. A steak house located inside Encore, right next to Surrender. Now this ain't your ordinary steakhouse. Afterall this is Vegas, and nothing in Vegas is ordinary. At Switch Steak, you get ever so timely environment changes (every 20 minutes) and fantastic food. I personally loved the decor, over the top vegas style! And every 20 minutes the lights will dim and dramatic music will play and the restaurant will literally change in front of your eyes. The ceiling changes or a new wall will come up....it's very impressive. The food here was excellent!! I ordered a 14 oz steak...medium rare and it was cooked perfectly: http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=h4o8e_Xbca2kXQO_vzOqgg&select=iU01tRSIP2nvA_rr008YuQSteak was about $56 and sides were 10 bucks a pop. But definitely worth every penny! My only complaint was the smell. It was subtle but lingered throughout the whole meal. At the end we figured out it was the leather placemats that were wiped with dirty rags...because it smelled like old dirty rags! Minus 1 star! I would definitely recommend this place for a special occasion or if you wanted a dramatic dinner. Just think of it as a transformers restaurant! Definitely more than meets the eye!
Bilbo's III Bar & Grill=this bar is awesome! Ive been coming to Bilbos for a few years now and it never fails. With an endless selection of beers to the fun game of shuffle board you will have an awesome time here. The bartenders always provide great service and the jukebox playing great music you will love this place. Why only 4 stars? it tends to get pretty smokey inside when there are a lot of people. Oh yea! and the chicken fingers with the volcano sauce is amazing. super spicy!
In-N-Out Burger=It's all about execution, baby!  As an operations guy I really appreciate the execution I see at In & Out burger again and again.  Since moving to AZ I have made probably 15 total visits to In & Out burger spread over 5-6 locations.  Not once has there been the slightest mistake on my order.Not once has an employee been anything less than polite and efficient.While In & Out is not the greatest burger on earth it is pretty good and has been 100% consistent across locations and visits.That's execution, baby.Stark contrast to a local McDonald's where it has actually become an amusing stat for us to follow.  They have not gotten an order right for us.  Ever.The five stars is because this is the BEST fast food burger joint in the USA.The food is hot and fresh, the menu is small so it keeps things simple and dang if the burgers are mouthwatering delicious.  This is the best thing to come out of california next to fake boobs.Parking is a pain, and there is usually a line (inside).  Avoid at all costs at lunchtime, it's PACKED, and that includes the drive-thru.  If you can't stand the line, there many alternatives within walking distance.Oh, and get a milkshake!
BlackFinn American Saloon=Looking for a place to kill a couple of hours before a Yelp event at SMG at Epicentre, we decided to pop a squat at the bar at BlackFinn for some apps and dranks.My GPS managed to navigate me directly to the EpiCentre parking deck (hooray!) where I got a prime parking spot.  Parking in the deck  - $3 per 30 min with a $20 max - so if you are there for dinner and a movie, prepare to pay $20 for parking.  Find the elevators - there are no signs that I could find on the side that I parked on to tell me that - but find the elevators, they will take you directly up to where you need to be.  After wandering around like a tourist for a bit, I walked upstairs to BlackFinn.  It was around 4:30, so I was sent to the bar downstairs, as the upstairs wasn't open yet?  Whatever... we found a spot easily at the big bar downstairs and were served by a friendly bartender who kept us drowning in drinks for 2 hours (great job!).For apps, we sampled the pretzels served with cheese sauce and the queso (more cheese) dip with tortilla chips.  The soft and warm pretzels, instead of being coated in coarse salt, were lightly sprinkled with what I think was parm cheese - good job - very good, much better than me flicking salt off all over the bar area.  The cheese dip was creamy and had a mustardy undertone to it.  The chipotle queso and chips were also very good.  They both made for great snacks to get us ready for dinner at the movies.  Friendly, efficient staff, typical uptown restaurant/bar prices, good food, workout from up and down the stairs - yay BlackFinn!
Kona Grill=If I could give this place less than one star, I would. My family and I had the WORST experience ever in this restaurant. My friends and I frequent the Kona at Scottsdale Fashion Square and we love them! So when we were looking for dinner by our house my dad suggested we go to this Kona, I jumped at the opportunity. BIG MISTAKE. We walked into the restaurant and after a few minutes were greeted by a hostess. She said it would only be about 10 minutes, which was fine with us, so we waited. About 10 minutes later I looked around and there were several open tables, I figured the servers just needed a moment to catch up, so we continued to wait. However, 20 minutes after we were still waiting... The hostess said she would bus the table and we would be seated shortly. She started busing the table then left to talk to a gentleman, who I am assuming was the manager. After talking to him, she finished busing the table. Looking around the front room; I could see at least 5 open tables. However, we were still not taken to the table she had just finished cleaning off. After waiting for over 30 minutes she finally took us to our table, where the hostess took our drink order saying our server would be right with us. The server stopped by about 5 minutes later to say she would be right with us. Where we waited for 10 additional minutes for someone to take our order. Needless to say, after spending almost an hour being ignored and not given service we decided they did not want, not did they deserve, our business. We left $5 on the table to cover the soft drinks ordered and left. The absolute lack of organization and customer service at this location is appalling, and management needs to seriously reevaluate their practices. We will never be back.
unPhogettable=unPhogettable is PHOnominal! Ok, bad joke aside, this is one of my new favorite Vietnamese restaurants. The food is extremely fresh and after talking with the owner, I found out that they make everything themselves from scratch with no MSG or prepackages meats. The service was excellent and the cafe setting was very inviting. Although a bit far from my house, I'll make the drive to come back here to eat again.unPHOgettable is quite PHOnomenalFor being Asian, service is remarkableGet filled up for less than ga$ in your abdominalNo MSG, no trans-fat makes it responsibleSummer rolls and pork taste so verrry nice Add some Sriracha and chili for that extra spiceOh! Love me long time, I need more rice!If ya don't have yellow fever, you'll be enticedEven my round-eye BF began to slantClapping his hands in a chantTried ordering more, though his pants can'tCalm down cracker, no need to take a chanceOn a food coma, me want some late night romanceBeing Vietnamese, I'm keeping it PHO-realEat here for an authentic PHO-bulous mealSituated next to an Asian market For that trustworthy PHO-king feelPHO-shizzle, PHO-sho, this ain't no faux-PhoI would rate this place 3.5 stars.  I really need my .5 star for many of my reviews.  Again, we picked this restaurant partly of its name and good reviews.  The name is very catchy and I wont Phoget for a long time.  however, their Pho did not live up to its name.  It's unPhogettable but not in a good way.  The broth was a little too strong.  I think the cook added too much star anise so it was quite overwhelming.  DH ordered Bun Bo Hue.  He said it was only okay.  My friends also ordered Pho bo and they thought the same thing.  The service was excellent.  Our waitress kept asking if we needed anything else.  The owner also came over to say hi and asked about the food.  I wasn't sure if I should tell her the truth or not.  I ended up telling her that everything was great.  I should have told her what I thought of her broth and maybe she should go easy on the star anise.  Oh well... maybe next time.What do you say in this situation?Great Pho but I don't tip at this place. I found out a while ago from a few workers there that the owners take the tip from the servers. One worker went on to say that even if I tried and put the money in their apron, they would still get in trouble if they don't give it to the owners. There are cameras everywhere. I thought that was kind of sad..so I rate this place a 2 star for good pho but bad business pratice. So remember to not tip!My fave pho place in the Valley!  Not only is the food delicious but the service is top notch and the restaurant itself is beautiful (definitely not a hole in the wall!).  The walls feature murals of bamboo and pretty, artistic photos of women wearing traditional Vietnamese dresses.  The place is family-owned and on several of our visits, the owners have come and chatted at length with us--very nice people!  They WILL remember you.  Being vegetarian, I recommend the veggie pho (selection V4 on the menu), which is like a tofu/veggie explosion in a soup bowl; it has mushrooms, broccoli, cauliflower, snow peas, bok choy, cabbage, and tofu plus the bean sprouts/lime/jalapeños that come alongside.  Really fresh and good!  I also love the vegetarian egg rolls--they're unique in that they come with lettuce and pickled veggies to wrap around them--they're my favorite egg rolls I've ever had hands down!Recommend this place highly!Hands down my favorite place for Vietnamese food~Owned by a lovely family, the service here is very friendly and very personal.  Through the owner's lovely wife, I learned how to drink Vietnamese coffee properly!  You may think that's a ridiculous thing to say but it was very motherly, sweet, and completely unnecessarily.  It's the fact that she took the time out to come over and teach me all the finer details of Vietnamese coffee that made the lesson and experience memorable.  Not even my Vietnamese friends had taken the time out to teach me!  Now the food here is truly unforgettable.  I love the bun by far!  It's crisp, fresh, and always leaves me full but not uncomfortably so.  I love their egg rolls and their spring rolls and the rice dishes are always savory and flavorful.  I must admit though there is probably only *one* other place I'd rather go to get pho over this place [because they're cheaper, just as delicious, and portions are just as big], I give this place one more star than the other because they're just sooo sweet and nice here!  The service really makes that one-star difference.  The prices here are a bit higher than other Vietnamese restaurants but the quality and freshness of the ingredients makes up for it.  With the modern decor, delicious food, and great service, what's not to love?
Blanco=Ate at Blanco last night.. very corporate and super accommodating.. we had a wonderful time which even surprised me.. stuck to the basics and thought it was the best of the Fox restaurants. Seeing that we've never had a good experience until last night says a lot. Was kind of cool seeing Sam Fox there actually quality controlling everything that was coming out of the kitchen.. though you know he was just annoying everyone, LOL!Had the short rib cheese crisp and you know what, it was actually crispy and good. Then tried the queso fundido con chorizo.. pretty darn tasty.. the cheese was slightly burnt on the bottom which I just love, wrapped in a warm flour tortilla, oh yeah! For dinner I ordered the machaca burrito.. is there such a thing as to much meat? I swear it was a whole beef roast wrapped in a tortilla.. the Mr had the green pork enchiladas.. I though those were very tasty but the sides were even tastier.. their rice is like risotto, very creamy! Helen Y was with us and she ordered the shrimp and crab civiche which I thought was extremely tasty though I would have loved it even more if it were on a toasted baguette! More like a shrimp and crab salad than a civiche though that's just me.. We ended with the tres leches cake.. this was a pretty dismal attempt at tres leches.. was so dense, chewy and sickening sweet. It was so sweet in fact it burnt my throat, pretty gross!What a great time! Blanco certainly has a fun open atmosphere and a fabulous patio with VERY comfortable seating out there.. you can order dinner up there instead of eating in the dining room which is very cool! Also, the staff was friendly and VERY attractive.. I think for me, this is the best of what Fox Concepts has to offer so far. Definite mass appeal.I am sorry, but did it say that Blanco serves Mexican food?  This is a disgrace.Lets just start by saying that my experience here was less than mediocre.  I usually find one thing wrong with a place and still give 4 stars.  This place deserves one star and 90% has to do with the food.  (The hostess was the other 10%...very unpleasant...like I was bothering her to get seated....honey that is your JOB!)I met my lovely friend Karla for lunch...she recommended the place and I have been wanting to try it.  We both ordered the chicken tortilla soup to start and I ordered also the enchiladas with green chiles.The chicken tortilla soup was a catastrophe.  It was made with chicken broth with every vegetable you can think of, chicken, and WHOLE tortillas.  The tortillas were a soggy mess and the soup was just G-d awful.  The server (who was nice) had the manager come over and take it off my bill.  (Which was nice.)  The manager even said that my soup looked very unappetizing.Next was the enchiladas...first...I didn't know that enchiladas were supposed to be HARD and CRUNCHY!!!  It was greasy, the cheese was flat out disgusting...and they even put my green chiles on the side when I did ask them to put them in the enchiladas. (Which shouldn't be too hard) And on top of everything else, my rice was BUTTERED WHITE RICE!!!!  In a Mexican style Restaurant?  Are you kidding me?  And it was so unappealing...(this meal I had to pay for...)There was no Mexican flavor or feel at all in this restaurant.  Very displeased and have no desire to ever step foot in there ever again.Like most Fox concepts, Blanco is pretty good. I'm not rushing to come back any time soon (mainly because there is so much Mexican food in much closer proximity to my house), but I would be a repeat eater. The food was pretty good - but not memorable. I really liked the chips and salsa and the guac. The veggie tacos were also very good. The chopped salad was good. The tuna tacos kind of meh. Good. And meh. So why the 4 stars? Blow jobs! Well, almost. I think.I was so impressed by the service. The hosts, waiters and managers were so attentive and friendly. Like, over-the-top friendly and giddy. Almost flirty. I'm sure if I was a dude they would have blown me or something. Next time I'm bringing a guy with me to test this theory. Anyone want to particpate in an experiment?I finally tried Blanco last Tuesday night... there were 4 in our party; not enough to make a reservation.  Luckily, when we arrived around 7:15 pm, we didn't have to wait more than 10 minutes to get seated.  And we must've lucked out, because our service was prompt and attentive.The guacamole is a perfect appetizer to share... and the chips and salsa are worth the splurge.  I shared a Caesar Salad to start, and that was quite tasty as well.  I was debating what to order for the main course and when I asked the waitress about the salmon she said she didn't eat seafood but that she's been told the salmon is 'buttery.'  Buttery salmon?  Really?  That didn't sell me on ordering the salmon, but it was what I went with after all.  And although I would not describe it as buttery, I will say it was good.  It was a generous serving as well, so I didn't mind when Jared started eating it off my plate.  The rice with veggies that it was served with was also tasty.Overall, Blanco didn't blow me away, but I am sure I'll return sometime.  You can't go wrong popping in for a drink or two and some chips, salsa, and guac in a trendy atmosphere.A lively mid-range restaurant. The crowd was mixed, but was comprised mostly of families. Strangely they played clubby music in the background. Service was really good, there were about five people servicing our table as a team. Everything came out quickly and they were able to accommodate all the bizarre dietary needs of our finicky group.The food itself was pretty basic. The big eye tuna ceviche was a significant deviation from real deal, it appeared to have small pieces of tortilla chips mixed in which through me off. The chicken fajitas were fine, but weren't a huge step up from something you could get at a chain.Final word: Ok for a casual or family dinner.Allow me to be an asshole for a moment while I write this terrible review. Maybe its because it was Monday, and raining.. maybe it was because I was in the mood for Humble Pie and not Mexican grill.. maybe its because restaurants in Arizona don't have the freshest sea food in the United States of America, whatever it was, I hated this place. I have this habit of asking my server what their favorite thing on the menu is.. and usually I go with it. I am adventurous, I like surprises.. So homegirl suggested the nachos or the Seared Ahi tacos.. so what do I do? I ordered a taco plate. Since I like variety, I mixed and matched and went with a fish & pork taco with black beans. The Ahi tasted wicked old and nasty fishy. I almost spit it out, but I am a lady and that is rude. The pork was very undercooked.. I don't know about you, but I have absolutely no interest in catching Trichinosis. I can think of better ways to spend my day than with nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, fatigue, fever, and abdominal discomfort.. sorry those are not things I am interested in, thanks anyway though. Beans were served cold and I swear the rice they served was something out a box from the dollar store. My dog could make better rice than that. There was shit floating in my water and the limes I asked for were so dried out that not one drop of juice came out. Seriously? Cut up some fresh ones.. its the little things that count. Service was slow, but the chick was nice enough. One of the girls I went with knew one of the managers, who was supposed to hook us up with an employee discount, but conveniently forgot about us at the end.. but what are you gonna do, nothing is free anymore. I dunno, I just wasn't impressed. The only thing I dug about this joint were the tiles on the wall.. and im certainly not going to return to a place to stare at a wall. next!Lovely restaurant in the Borgata, typical trendy decor that the Fox restaurants have going for them.  My girlfriend and I met up for margs and lunch on a Saturday, it was busy but we were able to get a table right away.  Our server was slow and not very friendly.  I had the cucumber and kumquat margarita with shrimp tacos.  The margarita was far better than the tacos - they were just normal shrimp tacos.  My friend got a cheese crisp which looked amazing and I would highly recommend that dish to anyone.I've been a customer of Blanco's for quite a while now. It's a go-to place for girl's night or a quick bite with my hubby. Unfortunately, Blanco has lost both my husband and I as patrons.On a recent Saturday night, we were craving a delicious cheese crisp and pitcher of sangria. After we had learned our lesson on weekends past, my husband called ahead for seating and we were informed it would be 45 minutes. No big deal and nothing we didn't expect. An hour after our call in time, and waiting in the restaurant for 30 minutes, I approached the hostess asking where we were on the list. She informed me it would be just a bit longer and they were working to get us a table. Half an hour after that, no table. I politely approached again and it was clear that we had been skipped, marked off the list and forgotten. The hostess stated the next table would be ours and to give them just a few more minutes. When I went to sit back down, the couple sitting next to us were seated. Infuriated, we both decided it was time to leave. My husband gave our pager back and the hostesses stood there like deer in the headlights. They said sorry but made no attempt to make the situation right. I find this type of thing to be completely unacceptable. We were patient, understood there would be a wait and still chose to spend our date night at this restaurant. In return we were greeted with lousy customer service and no table. On the plus side, we discovered a new restaurant right across the way we have been to multiple times now. Thanks for the help, Blanco!
Dragon Buffet=Still consistent and still decent, but I would say that I've experienced better. If you have a formula that works, stick to it. Since I started stopping by Dragon, the layout of the restaurant and the steam tables haven't changed. And more importantly, the food items haven't changed. They still offer a Black Pepper Pork and there are Barbecue Spare Ribs at dinner and the steamed dimsum and fried dumplings are there all day. Chicken & Broccoli and Lo Mein and such, too.They've had a few platters of sushi - nothing more than California Rolls - occasionally.With all of that said, there's a new player in town. Not even a mile further south is Jasmine Buffet which has more tables, better sushi and a cook-to-order hibachi grill with fresh veggies. Though it is a little more expensive there.
Mommys Fish & Chips Regd=Don't expect anything fancy, it's a real hole in the wall. This place has been in business since the early 70s and I understand why. Food : amazing. I absolutely love it. Their specialty is fish n chips and you can taste the Scottish authenticity. I hadn't gone in over 5 years, yet I did not taste any difference.Decor : reality is, there is none. Some posters of Scotland, but that's it. Note : they are located on the waterfront. I always go pick up my food and eat on the beautiful and scenic view of the waterfront. I suggest you do the same.
Sticky Fingers Smokehouse=One of my favorite places for ribs. First one I went to was in Greenville and we had our rehearsal dinner at the one in Charleston. ;-)Cost to worth it ratio: 3Eve award: Best baby back ribsHighlights:- Ribs: Meaty but tender; large but no major gnawing needed- Sauces: A variety of your choice for your ribs. Pick from carolina sweet, tennessee whiskey, memphis style wet, memphis style dry, carolina mustard, or habañero hot .-- Carolina sweet: my fave sauce. Basic tomato based one but with more sweetness to it like I like it--Tennesee whiskey: my second fave--has a bit of a whiskey kick- Sides: it defaults as cole slaw and beans but you can pick any 2. Other options are cinnamon baked apples, southern style rice, green beans, baked potato, macaroni & cheese, seasoned fries, or potato salad.-- Mac and cheese: I was craving this and it hit the spot. Cheesy but not too gooey and soft but not mushy noodles.-- Specials: they had broccoli casserole and sweet potato crunch. Love them both. Broccoli was almost blended with the cheese like a filling and very cheesy. Mashed sweet potatoes with brown sugar and nuts went well with the ribs but doubled as a dessert. :-)- Napkins: no measly white paper things here--they give you a green towel. ;-)- Lunch specials: they have a small portion of ribs as well as a few ribs and a bbq sandwich with sides- Location: driving distance from the hub's parents so a dining option I know I'll enjoyLowlights (my flip side to highlights):- MSG: I noticed most of the sauces included this and I prefer sauces that don't include this.- Pecan pie: I love pecan pie but never get to it here cause I fill up on ribsI'll be back to Sticky Fingers next time I get a chance.This place was something of a disappointment. Our server was amicable, but the wait time for the food was long, especially given that the establishment was half empty. When my pulled pork sandwich finally did arrive, the meat was bone dry and underseasoned. Fortunately, making liberal use of the array of BBQ sauces was enough to make it palatable. My companion's brisket sliders were a notch better but still nothing special, as were our sides (mac n cheese and sweet potato casserole). Eight dollars for a sandwich, side, and a drink is a fairly decent value these days, and Sticky Fingers has the right ambiance for the food it serves. However, the kitchen needs to get its act together.We were back in the Concord area and decided to give Sticky Fingers another try. To the establishment's credit, several of the problems (dried-out BBQ and slow service) we experienced during our initial visit did not recur. That and moderated expectations made for a much more enjoyable meal.Sticky Fingers was out of brisket when we visited, so my companion and I opted for a sausage/BBQ combo plate and an order of BBQ tacos, respectively. First, the good: all of the meats were moist, and the sausage had both a wonderful smoky aroma and a savory black pepper kick. The seasoned fries were also above-average. Now the bad: neither the pulled pork nor the pulled chicken had any discernable seasoning. Generous application of the house sauces (there are several, ranging from smoky to hot to sweet) and taco fixings remedied this, but one would expect smokehouse meats to be imbued with more flavor.Service was both friendly and prompt during this visit. While the $8 lunch specials weren't being offered, the $9 to $10.50 blue plate specials came in generous enough portions to justify the pricing. The brick-and-pipe decor remains a good fit for the cuisine, and there was plenty of seating.Upon re-evaluation, Sticky Fingers gets enough right (value, selection, sauces) to make it a decent lunch option, but the underseasoned BBQ continues to hold it back.
Le Roi du Smoked Meat=They claim to have the best smoked meat in Montreal. Is that the case? After eating a metric ton of meat and sugar at Cabane à Sucre Au Pied de Cochon hours before, apparently it seemed like a good idea to eat a giant smoked meat sandwich before bed. I wasn't mad at it. Being a huge fan of pastrami, it was pretty similar to what you'll find at places like Katz's and 2nd Avenue Deli in New York City. A little less fatty, but a nice flavor and stacked quite high. Served to you in a diner atmosphere by women that probably went to elementary school with your grandma, it makes for a fun experience.As others have pointed out, skip the poutine.
Poutine Lafleur=Ok, let's be honest. You never go to Verdun. You don't want to, and probably never will. But after spending a couple years in Montreal, you may develop a passionate love for poutines. Not the kind of drunken one-night stand love, but one of slow savoring of flavors. That's when you start searching for the perfect match.If I were on a Poutine dating show, no doubt Poutine Lafleur's poutine would in my final two. Fresh fries, fresh curds. Both fulfill the basic requirements. But the sauce. It's rich and peppery. A thick chicken gravy, not too saucy. Your fries won't get mushy. And it gets served in the classic container, none of that pretentious thing called a plate.If you're serious about finding the best poutine in the city, give this poutine a try (and Maam Bolduc's too, while you're at it) and forget about la banquise, la belle province or Patati Patata. And did I say it's cheap? $4 with taxes for the one pictured above.edit: This place is NOT to be confused with Lafleur the hotdog chain. It's a local thing, and the real deal.
CiCi's Pizza=When I was young my parents used to tell me that we would all meet up again in Heaven. At the time it seemed pleasant and relieving to think that I could just do my own thing now and catch up with everyone after we were all nuked to death in the zombie apocalypse.And then it dawned on me that Heaven might not be my scene. I imagined an afterlife where I was forced to spend all of eternity with all the gun-toting, bible-beating homo/xenophobes I spent my whole life antagonizing. Them looking all fucking smug and happy, Peaches Christ it makes me want to throw a shark at a mailman.So I have since decided that I will do whatever it takes to get into Hell. With all the drinking and sexing and, you know, changing my gender and all, I'm sure eventually I'll check off enough boxes to get me a backstage pass to Damnation. I occasionally burn down a village and smash a goblin's head in with a rock just in case I can get into Valhalla. Yeah.So Ci Ci's Pizza.Just like that.It sounds like heaven. A pizza buffet under 7 dollars. As much pizza, soup, salad, and dessert you could ever gorge yourself on. Every variety of pizza you could imagine. Fettuccine and spinach pizza. Taco pizza. Hawaiian pizza. Macaroni and cheese pizza. BBQ chicken pizza. And like the meal dispensing machines from "Red Dwarf", the kitchen is infinitely flexible. Want a flavor of pizza not currently available on the buffet line? They'll special make it. Just. For. You. They'll even send out one of their underpaid lackeys to bring it out to you on a tray, like a secret waiter without dignity who won't expect a tip.Ahh yes. It's a venerable heaven for a pizza lover.Until you realize it's everybody else's heaven. Everybody else you hate.Parents who bring their five kids because Little Timmy hasn't developed table manners yet and would just embarrass them at a real restaurant. The unreasonably picky eater who keeps taking one slice of each pizza on the line, taking the smallest of bites, and deciding its too salty too cheesy too saucy for his tastes and throws it away, forcing you and the staff to watch at least three whole pizzas thrown away before he finds a flavor he likes.The family that wisely figures that since Grandma has a hard enough time walking to Red Lobster, they might as well bring her somewhere she'll have to give her legs some exercise just to get some salad.All the underpaid, bitter and apathetic high schoolers who all lost their jobs at Harkins when they showed up for work with their name tag missing...THE THIRD TIME THIS MONTH!It's a shame Ci Ci's has such a suck infestation. Because they'll probably be shut down by the health inspector before anyone realizes that they aren't just pizza makers; they're wizards. No, alchemists.Only an alchemist schooled by The Beast himself would be able to take a lump of dough and make it into breadsticks, pizza, cheese bread, cinnamon rolls, and apple pie.This isn't just a cutesy metaphor. It's seriously the same dough. Fun Fact: The first time I came here I was approached by a manager and offered a job, not based on my experience in the food industry or my impeccable customer service, but because I had a quirky t-shirt on. "You have the sense of humor needed for this."Funny. I imagine Peter saying the same thing to me once I get to the front desk at the Pearly Gates.For the love of trolls, Odin. Give me a sign already.
Pita Pit=Pita Pit is hands down the best final stop on any downtown Charlotte drinking tour.The line is long, but the staff is very experienced at keeping it moving.  Also, you will seldom find a more drunkenly amiable line to stand in.  I made more friends in the Pita Pit line than I made at the last Yelp event.The food is...well...to tell you the truth I can never remember.  However, judging by the clothes I wore the night before, it can be a bit messy.Definitely go here before passing out on your next night of revelry, your hangover will thank you.The people who work the late shift here deserve a medal. Or holiday. Or the biggest hug ever. Seriously, how would you feel if you were at work and an army of blackout drunk people stormed into your office? They deal with it every Friday and Saturday night.I'll be honest... I'm usually not sober when I end up here. I'll make fun of the other drunk people and act like I'm completely fine. I dunno if anyone buys it.My go-to order is the buffalo chicken loaded with some type of combination of mushrooms, jalapenos, banana peppers, insert whatever veggie I'm feeling and a bunch of tzatziki. I usually take it to go so I can eat it at home in pajamas. However, if you can snag a seat sit and stay for the show of the endless parade of the inebriated.I have to give props to the workers here. They handle it all in stride and are pretty good sports about everything. Don't be discouraged by a long line. Pita Pit can pump orders pretty quickly so they wait is never all that long. If you want to avoid the madness, make sure you get here before 2am to get there before the rush.
Woo Che=Wow..!I mean wow! How can you get so much food for only $15.95?Take the gluttony of a buffet and its various entrees, ranging from fried rice and quasi-sushi rolls and smash it together with a Korean BBQ-grill-at-your-table and you get something that's purely American with an Asian twist. Not so great for vegetarians or those trying to reduce their meat intake but I digress. They have an entire row of raw meat; marinated beef and pork, unmarinated beef and pork, chicken, shrimp, squid, etc. So choose what your heart desires because it will stop functioning after one session here.. a last meal, if you will.Enough snark...For the uninitiated:The marinated beef and ribs are slightly sweet yet yield slightly different tastes.The marinated pork and squid are slightly spicy.The unmarinated slices of beef and pork are meant to be eaten with the lettuce.. like a lettuce wrap; you can season accordingly with the various sauces available at the counter. My personal favorite is to mix the salt and pepper with sesame oil as a dipping sauce.If you feel so inclined you can try the tripe.. I didn't.Thanks to Naurry K.'s ROTD and other yelpers that I got to witness the madness of woo-che asian grill buffet.This place is packed, and I do mean a steady stream of customers on a Wednesday night.  Make reservations, especially if your party is more than four!  (And like others have said, their largest table does only accommodate 6 people, so your group will have to be split up if it's bigger!)They have a decent amount of food to choose from with the main focus of the food being Korean.  Soups:Miso soup, Seaweed soup, Korean Tofu soup (which was pretty good, like Eve Michelle C. also mentioned)Tons of marinated meats - beef, pork, chickenMarinated seafood - squid, shrimpOther Korean goodies you usually get as banchan: potato salad-like thing, vinegary clear weird texture noodle thing, creamy version with the weird texture noodle thing (but pretty good!), bean sprouts, kim chee, etc.Cooked foods like baked mussels (with mayo topping), pike(?) fish (that had a salty outside but really good), crab, shrimp, gyozas, veggies, etc.They also have soba noodles, chop chae, purple rice, raw crab (Korean style), lettuce for wrapping your meats, dipping sauces including the sesame oil and salt concoction, etc.And if you must, they have sushi too!  Desserts include fresh fruit (cantaloupe), jello, and shikhye (which I was pretty excited about since I rarely get it anymore at other Korean restaurants).  And plus, vanilla and chocolate ice cream too!Service was good, depending on who you got.   Our waitress was great about refilling our soda and tea (which is included), clearing plates, and they also changed out our grill mid-way 'cuz it was getting so grubby! Overall, you really can't beat the price for the amount of food and selection available.  And yes, keep in mind your clothes, jackets, and purse will stink really bad afterward.  And like Jason L. said, it gets cold in there, especially if you're sitting in the back.  So bring a jacket you don't mind stinking up in there with you!Lunch (M-F 11 am to 3 pm) $12.99/ppDinner (M-Sun 3 pm to 10 pm) $15.99/ppSat/Sun/Holidays (All Day) $15.99/ppThey also have a discounted child price too.**Summary**       - Marinade - All the meats that have marination are well marinated.       - Value - Even though they raised their prices to $18.99 for dinner, they're still below Sura ($22.95) and Honey Pig ($19.99). Plus, they don't restrict what you can get unlike Honey Pig's one short rib order limitation.       - Decor - The place doesn't look as great with their portable A/C units lying around.       - Grill - Don't forget that you can always ask for a new grill when you've burnt yours up.**Price**       - $12.99 Lunch AYCE 11am-3pm Mon-Fri       - $18.99 Dinner/Weekend AYCE 3pm-Midnight Mon-Fri, Sat & Sun**Available**       - Beef Galbi(Short Ribs) (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/07gh-AImcEcWQ2bew-jprg?select=8ps50HLC6pTQ5rJ7rEfkng)       - Bulgogi (Marinated Beef)       - Deungshim Gui (Sirloin)       - Chadol Baki (Thinly Sliced Brisket) (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/07gh-AImcEcWQ2bew-jprg?select=nI_1i_NOfAd0PwpGCPK5vA)       - Pork Galbi (Pork Ribs) (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/07gh-AImcEcWQ2bew-jprg?select=gCmu20le5ieLGe5v3dZhAw)       - Samgyeopsal (Unsalted Bacon AKA Pork Belly)       - Spicy Pork Bulgogi (Marinated Pork)       - Decent size assortment of hot foods (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/07gh-AImcEcWQ2bew-jprg?select=BRiOubp6yE79ZSlkmUJuGQ)**Recommendations**       - After trying all the other AYCE Korean BBQ places in town, I definitely favor Woo Che over the others. They're cheaper and their meat has more flavor.
Kafein Café-Bar=Last night, my friend and I were looking for a casual place for a drink so we headed to Kafein on Bishop. I was not aware that this café by day turns to a bar by night. As I entered the bar, I was immediately taken by the cosy, home-like vibe. The décor was lovely. With its Red walls, the lights dimmed, and red velvet chairs, Kafein is made attractive and welcoming. I ordered a Mojito. Served in a mason jar for 10$, I was satisfied with my choice. I would recommend this place for a date. Though the music became increasingly louder as the night progressed, Kafein maintains a romantic atmosphere, which in turn makes you at ease and relaxed.
Alchemy=So now that I live on the East Side, I've come to really appreciate and enjoy Alchemy. Yes, it's small, and yes, there's almost always a wait for a table. Yes, they only take cash, but hey, there's an ATM that only charges a $1 fee.Despite those very minor inconveniences, the place is a true gem. Nothing beats sitting at the bar, enjoying one of the awesome taps they always have available (or a classic cocktail, or a very reasonable bottle of vino), with a plate of grilled bread (which comes with a spread/dip that changes regularly), and then splitting an entree with a friend.I've yet to have something that isn't delicious; from salads to fish frys to the bella burger - it's all superb. Service has been consistently good, and the vibe/feel of the place is so welcoming.Go. You won't regret it.I feel right at home when the first thing asked of me upon sitting down at a table is, "Bloody Mary's?" On a Sunday morning recovery lunch excursion, our server didn't have to ask us twice. Their Bloodies have the perfect amount of spice and flavor - definitely a fan.For food, I opted most recently for the BLFT, which OMFG, why have I not been requesting my tomatoes to be fried in a beer batter for every sandwich I've ever eaten? I went with a cous cous salad with pumpkin and walnuts for my side since it was the special for the day. It's all about balance, my friends. My companion hammered through the Tinshack Smokehouse Burger with fries and after taking a bite of the burger, I almost went hobbit on that lunch and devoured both our meals. I think I'm still finding green peppercorn aioli under my nails. Yum. Ew.Warm ambiance and a casual setting with anything but casual food. The only downside is they only take cash but the fee for the ATM isn't too lucrative. Get at it.I love this place, so comfortable and "real."The hubs and I had the special burger tonight made with Black Earth beef, portobello mushroom, spinach, Swiss cheese and onions carmelized in the Ommegang Glimmerglass beer. Are you kidding me? Who thinks of these combinations? It was SO good!Paul had their "chips" which are their house fries, and I upgraded to the sweet potato fries. I figure I might as well go all the way if I'm going to eat a burger.My husband loves the rotating beer taps and watches their Facebook page for updates. They go through the specials quickly, so stop in within 24 hours of them posting a special beer if you want to be sure  they have a pint for you.They also make a great brandy old fashioned and a hopquila margarita with lemongrass ginger kombucha! Again, so creative!
XO Le Restaurant=Over the top!!!  Best gazpacho ever along with the most unusual and tasty steak tartar with quail egg. Cheeses and deserts were wonderful. All in a quiet and sophisticated setting. Best French rosé in a long time as well as a great Cotes de Roussilion.
Fiore Bistro=I literally just had lunch at Fiore Bistro. Well, I was not in an actual bistro, but the meal certainly made me forget I was eating in a food court. Though, I have been to this place many times before, their food has not ceased to satisfy my hunger and I. The concept is great. Bistro food served quickly, yet taste and quality remain high. This afternoon, I ordered the grilled chicken with nicely seasoned potatoes and grilled vegetables. All meals include salad or soup and portions are big compared to the average meal size at a food court. My only problem with this place is the price. My meal cost me almost 23$ taxes included. Perhaps my hunger made me forget to check the prices beforehand, though I was not expecting the meal to cost more than 15$. I find this to be WAY too expensive for a bistro in a food court. Yes, the quality is greatly above food court average, however paying 23$ for my meal made me feel foolish. But aside from the price, to reiterate, the food is great. They have other options such as pastas, fish, and steak; some equally expensive others more affordable.
Amarone Ristorante Italiano=Pizza A Metro in CenPho is branching out! For those of you on the East side, you will pleased to know that they are ramping up their new location in the next few weeks with some invite only soft-launches. If you want to be included, stop by the Thomas location and give them your contact info...  The hard launch is scheduled for October 1, 2008.I sat down with Maurizio today during lunch and got some of the particulars to whet your appetites -- The new location is larger, much larger. They will have a wine room, a bar that will seat approximately 25, and the dining room with seating for 80+.Some of your favorites will appear on their menu, but Amarone will include a lot of new items which are more in line with the larger kitchen and the more upscale flavor of the new site.Amarone will be open from 11:00 to Midnight.For anyone that hasn't had the pleasure of meeting or dining with Maurizio, you are in for a treat. This man LOVES food and experiences obvious pleasure from sharing it with others!East-siders, mark your calenders and get ready for Amarone!I think grand is a word I'll be using over and over to describe the decor of Amarone.  It looks nothing remotely like Pizza a Metro.  From the gates through which you enter the restaurant, to the enormous round marble bar which has lights shining up through it, to the giant chandeliers, it seems that the recession has not hit this part of Scottsdale.  The grandeur seems out of place in this tired strip mall with its bowling alley and assortment of small businesses.  But once you're inside, you feel like you're in a different world - somewhere between a restaurant in NYC's Little Italy and a swanky hotel bar.  Maurizio and his friendly team were gracious enough to seat us even though we arrived past 10pm on a weeknight (kitchen closes at 10pm).  The fresh out-of-the-oven pita-like bread that Metro is so known for hit our table first with a side of caramelized onions and other aromatics.  We really liked the light coating of olive oil and salt on the warm thin bread.  Then came our order:Stuffed Mushrooms $10 - shrooms stuffed with sausage, ricotta, parmesan in a lemon garlic veal stock reduction:  lots of flavor although the stuffing tasted a bit too much like liver for one of usShrimp Scampi $11- half dozen large butterflied shrimp in a lemon butter white wine sauce:  the shrimp were huge but unfortunately lacked flavor Homemade Gnocchi  $14 - in a tomato sauce with cubes of mozz and basil: the light and airy gnocchi was definitely our faveI found the sauces on my two apps a bit unbalanced and the plating old-fashioned.  It seems that the dishes that Metro are known for are still the stars here.  Given how large the menu is, I really need to come back and try a few of the 16 pastas ($14-$23) and 17 mains ($18-$28) before I can give a real verdict.  Get the word out: Amarone is open for business!
Restaurant Pho Lien=Pho Lien is the best Vietnamese Beef Noodle (Pho Bo) restaurant in Montreal. Don't take my word for it, that is from the Vietnamese locals who know food. The owner used to run a factory locally, but when those opportunities went to China for cheaper costs, he had to shut down the Factory and try something different. So he went and hired the best Pho cook he could find, employed him for a year, and learned how to make good Pho. It isn't to California standards, but here in Montreal, C'est Magnifique!
Louisiana Fried Chicken=This little place just opened in a strip mall and you'd probably miss it if you didn't know it was there. Fortunately, I knew thanks to a well-timed coupon arriving in the mail.The Cajun-inspired fried chicken is juicy with a crispy skin and just-right flavorings. I had coleslaw and mashed potatoes with gravy for sides and they were great. The gravy had just the right kick and the coleslaw was among the best I've ever tasted.They also carry fried shrimp which I'll be back to try and they have many other sides including fried okra for those with the stomach for such things.Friendly, helpful, and quick counter service in this to-go-only restaurant. It's small, but it has a big heart. It's part of a chain of restaurants, but this is the only one in Arizona so far. Here's hoping it's not the last!I will run on the treadmill for an hour to indulge in the deliciousness that is Louisiana Fried Chicken. The fried chicken is moist and spicy, I paired it with fried okra and mashed potatoes and gravy. It was probably a 2500 calorie meal and I loved every single bite.
Toast! Kitchen & Wine Bar=First impression.  Totally ooh la la romantical inside.  I felt like I was meeting a french lover and we would sit closely and feed each other croissants.  ,I was, in fact, not meeting my french lover, but some fab yelpers for a new dining experience.  They did not feed me anything, but I did enjoy some good food and great company!Being good little foodies, we had researched the menu (thanks Serena!) and decided to go with the food pairing.  Our waiter was little to no help in actually describing any of the menu items we would receive or up selling the extra $20 wine pairing.  Strike one.We decided to not do the wine tasting and just choose 2 half glasses.  It was really interesting how they break down the wine servings.  You can buy a 2oz, 4oz, 8oz and bottle.  I actually like that because it encourages you to try different wines you may not be familiar with.  Or be too scared to try and not like for fear of blowing $10 a glass!  Strike two came as we sat there for a good 20 minutes after our food was ordered waiting for our waiter to come back and ask us what our wine selection would be (hint to business: people who drink spend more money, so hurry it up:).  We actually had NO clue what kind of food we would receive for the tasting.  Not a good choice for a picky eater.  I applaud those who aren't (and get annoyed at those who are, sorry folks!).  The first course came and it looked as if two people received one dish and two people received another.  I had the angel hair crab pasta.  It was an interesting dish to start with but it was a strong start food wise because the white cream sauce was really tasty.  The next dish was trout with greens, or it at least looked like that.  I could barely understand the food runner as he literally, ran away.  It was OK.  Nothing memorable...literally because it's the one dish I struggled to remember as I thought back at the four dishes.  Third dish was the spinach salad with goat cheese and blueberry vinaigrette dressing.  I love when restaurants have interesting salad choices.  A simple salad is just that, simple.  You can add flavor, literally, to any salad with an array of toppings and dressings.  I really enjoyed the uniqueness of this one.  My last dish was quail with risotto and spinach.  Greens were obviously in high quantity in the kitchen tonight!  I actually thought this was the best dish.  It surprised me because I'm usually not a fan of "chicken" dishes.  It was really tender and flavorful with a ginger reduction sauce.  I also liked the risotto and spinach mix.  The sauce made it really rich and flavorful as well.Where's strike three you ask?  Well, we waited FOREVER for everything!  Water, wine, meals....Bueller....Bueller??  The saving grace was that someone (server, food runner, manager, busboy...no clue) came out and apologized for the slow service and told us desserts would be on the house.  If you know me, you know a desert can fill a lot of voids in my life.  Maybe even bad service.  We received a peanut butter ice cream sandwich (YUM!), balsamic ice cream (DOUBLE YUM, surprisingly), rhubarb pie (Ew, too tart) and lemon pie (Ew, too sweet).  The only one on the table left almost in tact was the rhubarb pie.  Tasting menu's are usually the way to go when you're at a new restaurant and want to sample a bunch of different items.  I almost feel like I may have been better off choosing one item (mac n cheese, I'm looking at you!).  So yes, I'll be back.  Soon?  Not so sure.  And I'll for sure be a one meal kinda woman.  French lover style.I visited Toast for a date with CM on Tues. evening at around 8pm.  He wanted to do something low-key, and I wanted to get drinks, so Toast fit the bill for a compromise as a low-key bar.Sure enough, when we arrived, it wasn't busy at all, and was pleasantly cozy and quiet. To ensure that we'd get a table, I'd made a reservation, so our waitress seated us at one of the tables in the back area under the painting of a city skyline. There was music playing from a speaker above the table, but it wasn't too loud, and was quite an interesting mix of older and more contemporary tunes, adding to the mood.Given that the Tues. special is $6 cocktails, I assumed that it referred to all of the cocktails on the menu, so I mentioned the special to our waitress.  She clarified that the $6 cocktails are special and off menu, however, and vary by the week.  This week, our choices were a cocktail called a ragtime, which tasted reminiscent of root beer, which I ordered, and a Prosecco cocktail, which CM ordered.  Both of the cocktails were nicely balanced, with mine being on the sweeter side (though not overly so), and we both enjoyed them very much.  In addition to the cocktail, I also ordered a glass of the Riesling ice wine, since I enjoy Riesling, and I'd heard of ice wine, but had never tried it before.  If you are looking for a good dessert wine or enjoy sweeter wine, I'd definitely recommend it, though it's on the pricier side for $10/glass.  Unfortunately, I ended up spilling some of it by knocking the glass over when gesturing.  :-(In addition to our drinks, we ordered the cheese board to share ($12), which came with the following cheeses (as explained by our waitress): Goat cheese, blue cheese, camembert, manchego, and sharp cheddar.  Additionally, it came with some apple butter and a few toasted bread strips (see photo).  All of these components were quite tasty, with my favorites being the goat cheese and camembert. I only wish they would provide more bread sticks or crackers with the cheese plate--though our waitress was happy to provide us with some more upon request.Overall, I was quite pleased with our experience at Toast.  In contrast to others' experiences, our service from our waitress (didn't get her name) was attentive and helpful.  To be honest, given the mixed reviews in combination with the cost of entrees, I doubt I'd have a full meal at Toast (except for with a discount, perhaps). However, it's definitely a great spot to have a few drinks in a cozy, intimate, and relaxed setting with some good friends or a date! 4.5 stars.
Bull & Barrister Draft House and Grille=How anyone had a good enough experience here to leave anything but a scathing review is an absolute mystery to me.Such a shame, and a waste of a great location and nice building - I want to like this place, I really want to, and I tried to SO HARD. This place was great when it was a Midtown Sundries, and I had high hopes when they dressed the place up when it sold and became Bull and Barrister, but it's been a steady decline in every way imaginable over the past couple of years. The only thing worse than the food the last few times I was there was the service, and I *used* to enjoy the atmosphere, but I have a hard time enjoying anything when everything (EVERYTHING) I touch is sticky (the floor, the tables, my seat (wtf?)...)This place got more chances to get their act together than most because they're less than a mile from my house. Often times we'd say "well, it sucks but it's close by...maybe this time they'll surprise us?" Yeah, we were in denial.First off, you'll likely wait quite a while to be seated, and then you'll spend the majority of your dining experience waiting on your server to grace you with their presence. It isn't that they're busy - far from it - it's just that the hosts/hostesses are busy dicking around in the kitchen with the line cooks and the waitresses are far too busy texting their bfs and bffs on their cell phones to acknowledge your existence.I can even forgive crap service for decent food at a convenient location, but everything I ordered during my last handful of visits -aside from the sweet potato fries - sucked hardcore: southwestern taco salad, barrister club, nachos, chicken fingers...I tried simpler and simpler things to make (how do you screw up something you just toss in a fryer?) but to no avail, it was all pretty repulsive.The very last thing I ordered there was a black and bleu burger. I had a vague thought after I ordered: "hmm...our waitress did not ask me how I wanted that cooked, oh well, I'll deal with a well done burger..." When it arrived I realized that they used those frozen 1/2 inch beef patties that are too think to cook any way but well done. It was also suffocated in overly salty shake spices and charred to resemble a little black hockey puck, except I think a hockey puck may have been a little more savory and moist. I hate HATE sending food back, it's maybe once every 5 years that I do, but this was just inedible. When our waitress finally stopped by about 20 MINUTES after dumping off our 'food' I tried to politely point out my problem and asked if I could just get some chicken fingers instead hoping those would be safe and she said with a look of utter confusion "sooo....you want two dinners?" uhm, what? no. I'd really prefer to eat dinner just once, and I'd prefer it be digestible. What is wrong with you? I ended up just asking for the chicken fingers to go and she took my sick sad burger to the garbage, but sure enough, when the bill came, I was charged for both a burger and chicken fingers. I just paid it so I could get out of there as soon as possible and never return. Every time I pass this place (daily, damn it) I wonder how it is still in business and say a little prayer that maybe tomorrow will be the day the sign gets taken down and we have something halfway decent down the street from us. The only thing I'd find this establishment good for at this time is a bottled beer. And the only time I'd go there for it is if I was in the mood for it to be warm by the time it made it to my table 20 minutes after I ordered it. Just sayin.
Fogo de Chão Brazilian Steakhouse=Havent been to a Brazilian-style steakhouse since in Puerto Vallarte this past summer. While the meat was better in PV the salad bar at Fogo is a low carbin' dream! We're talking fresh mozzarella, mushrooms, Parmigiano-Reggiano (a whole wheel), manchego cheese, prosciutto.. delicious and satisfying all this and more for only 19.50! Now if you want to have endless rounds with the Gaucho's you'll have to pony up $42.50 (including unlimited salad bar), a real bargain if you ask me, great quality. The meat just keeps coming and coming.. highlights were the leg of lamb, garlic beef and the sausage. They also bring a basket of bread (they forgot ours) as well as fried bananas, mashed potatoes and fried polenta.. be sure to skip that stuff and stick to the meats and salad bar. Oh, avoid the pork ribs.. while the Mr liked his, mine tasted like they were in someones ass for a while.. pretty nast though I think was the bones. Now if the only the Gaucho's were shirtless or wearing ass less chaps.. well one would hope.What an amazing event! Fabulous food, wonderful service, cool atmosphere and terrific company set off a spectacular evening. 12 hours after it has finished and I am still full. Fogo De Chao offers remarkable service that is extremely attentive leaving customers wanting for nothing. One of the staff even took us in small groups to tour the kitchen and see how the various meats are cooked to perfection.Gabi - thank you so much for organizing this event.As I sit here, consumed with a meat based hangover, I have fond memories of last evening.  The service, the food, the crowd all fabulous.I can't thank them enough, for a graduate student who has had dreams of reaching meat nirvana, this was an excellent opportunity.What a great way to get introduced to Fogo De ChaoAnd I thought I would still be full this morning because of all the wonderful food I consumed last night.  (Sorry meal plan, but I had to break a couple rules last night...)  Food, service, atmosphere were all A+!!!!  The meat was cooked to perfection.  The salad bar is AMAZING!!!  And the tour of the kitchen and the private room was a great touch to end the evening.Thank you Gabi for putting this together!  It was such an excellent treat!A meat feast!  Woo hoo!I am STILL full. The staff was great. Everything was delicious. I really can't pick a favorite. I wish I would have been able to have more of what was offered at the salad bar, but I wanted to save as much room as possible for all the meat. And there was plenty of it. Thank you Rolando for taking us on a tour of the kitchen. This was so neat. I think he said all but 2 of the cooks were Brazilian.And thank you Gabi for putting this together. We had an amazing time.  :)Too many restaurants, too little room in my pants.  Although on my list, Fogo De Chao had taken a back seat to other less deserving establishments it seems.  Not forgotten, just cast aside for the time being.  I hang my head in shame at that now.I could not resist the abundance of tempting offerings at the salad bar.  Since I could not possibly try everything and still eat meat, I opted to sacrifice everything green.  I filled my plate with cheeses, smoked salmon, prosciutto, roasted veggies, and everything not in the leafy green category.  At the table, I could also not resist the fried polenta and fried bananas.  And those little popovers!  Since they were small, I didn't count how many I consumed.   Leaving little room for the meat attraction, what I did sample was tender and flavorful.Big thanks to Gabi and the wonderful staff in the front and in the kitchen who made sure we were taken care of from start to finish.  Once I recover, I'll be back for more!Filet, Sirloin, and Ribeye, oh my!This was my first Fogo De Chao experience, and it exceeded my expectations!  I've been to other Brazilian steakhouses in the past, but Fogo was fabulous!  Sure, I could've made a meal on the sensational thirty item salad bar on it's own, but I took a breather and then went for the meat.  Green light on!  I also enjoyed the crispy hot polenta and caramelized banana side dishes. Yum!Rolando was the waiter I had the most contact with and he was remarkable.  Evan, the GM, was friendly as well... this was such a treat to be a part of, and of course, even more fun because I was surrounded by some of my favorite yelpers!Thanks Fogo folks - once I digest my 2 - 3 lbs of meat, I'll be back to see you again!I've had two experiences at Fogo.  One with a very large party and one with a party of four.  Both the service and food were consistent.  For anyone new to Fogo, it's a fixed price (about $45) for salad bar and all you can eat meat (beef, pork, chicken, lamb).  Start with salad bar (save room) and flip your little card to green when you're ready for meat.  A parade of servers will offer their wares, say yeah or neah and wait for the next.  Flip card to red when you don't need service.Salad bar is fantastic.  I can't resist the smoked salmon, mozzarella balls, and apple salad.  In fact, on my second trip, I loaded up so much from the salad bar, I skipped the meat entirely.  I'm also particularly fond of the polenta and bread (which is more like a popover).  Based on my first experience, some of the meat offerings are better than others.  But since you can have as much or as little of anything as you would like, try everything.  I can also recommend the papaya cream for dessert.  Don't worry you won't have room.  It's light enough that you can make room.As far as service, it is excellent.  As soon as you flip that card to green, servers are there.  The only complaint on both visits is that they do ask if they can bring you a particular cut of meat, and then they don't follow through anyway.  It's not like you'll go hungry, but it can be a little annoying.This is meat nirvana, and the best Brazilian-style steakhouse I have visited.I started with a Brazilian beer in the bar, then met up with several friends for dinner here on Saturday night. We all had a great time trying the 15 different cuts of meat, the unusual salad bar, and the sides of potatoes and plantains (which are all included for under $50). My personal favourites were the filet, ribeye, and the "house beef".What's that you say? A VEGAN going to a Brazilian Steakhouse? How can this be? Two Words: SALAD BAR! Set in a Fine Dining Atmosphere Fogo De Chao offers a Pristine Salad Bar fit for a Vegan Queen. Choices like Brazilian Hearts of Palm, Whole Shitake Mushrooms, Jumbo Asparagus, Whole Artichoke Hearts, Sun Dried Tomatoes, Butter Lettuce and the list goes on and on. Some of the traditional side dishes are also vegan safe like the fried bananas and also the fried polenta with no cheese. Both are very delicious! Trust me you wont leave hungry. I've been twice now and would gladly dine here again anytime!P.S.  The staff was incredible, our service was flawless and, we were completely taken care of every second of our visit.Valentine's Day and what can be better than a wonderful night out with my beautiful wife!  We booked reservations at Fogo de Chao and were looking forward to a wonderful evening.  We arrive promptly for our reservation and were warmly greeted by a 20 minute wait standing in an overcrowded lobby.  We overheard the hostess tell another patron that Fogo was running behind because people were taking longer than expected to eat.  I guess they did not account for folks actually wanting to enjoy their meal and their conversation on Valentine's Day.  We were taken to our table and our waiters greeted us with "Man, I am tired, can't wait until by shift ends."   - Sorry for the inconvenience.  We will try not to ask too much of you. -  Well, I think he read my thoughts because we went to the salad bar and returned to find that we still did not have our drinks, including water, or forks.  We did a quick check to see in anyone else was eating with their hands as part of the cultural experience.  But, they had forks and water, so we waited.  And waited... Finally, we flagged down a meat chef who kindly gave use the equipment necessary to begin our meal.  The food was average.  The steaks were great, but the lamb was gamey and the chicken was average and a bit dry.   The rolls were beautifully prepared and had an interesting texture.  We were invited to try their dessert, but decided that we did not want to overstay our welcome.  So we politely asked for our check and waited.... We did pass the time watching the waiters flip through the bills from other customers evaluating their tips like the IRS agents checking tax returns.  To be serious for a moment, for the price of this restaurant, we expected a more classic dining experience with a professional, attentive wait staff, etc. However, it may have just been a over overcrowded since it was Valentine's Day.   Yet, that is exactly why we picked this establishment in the first place....First, on a personal note, I can't eat a lot in one sitting, so all-you-can-eat places generally aren't for people like me. $65 to eat an amount of food I could get for a third of the price doesn't make sense to me. If you can eat $65 worth of meat, by all means, come here. I was pleased with the meats. All were prepared well, and the flavor was amazing. I got to have leg of lamb, lamb chops, various steaks, and some pork loin. All were satisfying and tasty. My problem is with two things: value for the dollar, and soft drinks. The website for the establishment says all beverages and desserts are extra. Fine. But for $65 a head, I think I should be able to have a bottomless beverage, not $4 for each 12 oz can of ginger ale. This is America. Get with the program. Bottomless beverages are expected in this country. Install a fountain. I got to try a bite of the key lime pie, and it was no better than a slice of Edward's frozen key lime pie that you can get in any grocery store. Why do I mention this? Because a single slice of key lime pie here is $8.50. I can get the whole pie and a can of whipped cream for that and still have change left over. I am a frugal person, and I believe this place lacks a few amenities that its price tag would usually indicate. I probably won't be back any time soon.
Brutopia=Good people trying to make something that matters in the Montreal community. Jeff and his team both at Bru and at Jane are scrappy and pouring a lot of love and hard work into what they do. Like Hurley's, Brutopia is a haven on lower Crescent but Bru is generally a little younger and more rawkus. There are lots of small corners to tuck into, and sitting near the shiny brassy beer-making apparatus always makes me feel cozy. The food and beer might not be always superfoodie accolade winning, but for those of us just looking for good heart and a tasty good time somewhere away from tight pants and hairspray that dominates much of this strip, especially during F1, Brutopia is gold. The layout is pretty great for live music and quiz nights and open mics too; intimate but with a lofty upstairs perch that feels almost old timey.Je ne suis pas type bière, mais je suis allée dans ce pub une fois avec mon mari et des amis pour un 5 à 7. Il y a un bon choix de bières et d'alcool. Les prix sont raisonnables. On peut aussi y manger, il y a une cuisine. Le choix de mets est typique de ce type d'établissement: nachos, ailes de poulet, etc. La serveuse était assez gentille, l'ambiance était feutrée et sombre et la musique était raisonnable, donc on pouvait se parler sans crier à s'en briser les cordes vocales, ce que j'apprécie grandement quand je suis avec des copains!
Don Pedro Mexican Restaurant=After five years, we're back to Don Pedro for a late lunch on the weekend. It hasn't changed at all. My daughter and I ended up in one of the booths along the wall.The food is still good and the portions are -massive-. The plate in the entryway is what you're going to end up with so be ready. I had the Deluxe Burrito and there was a ton of it. It might be hard to tell in my picture, but buried under that sour cream and guacamole is a large burrito stuffed with chicken.My daughter chose the chicken fajitas and there was also a lot there. Only three tortillas, but plenty of chicken, onions and peppers.Drinks were refilled. The queso is no longer a problem - it probably wasn't poured into a cold bowl so it stayed cheesy until our entrees arrived.Service was quick. Table-side guacamole is available too.If you're looking for fancier Mexican, you've found it. Don Pedro is a step above the usual Mexican places along Burrito Way.
Humble Pie=I'd just like to thank Andrew K. for introducing me to this gem. You are a wonderful wonderful man because dudes, this place is delicious. Strawberries, Gorgonzola & candied pecans on fresh greens - hell yes. Perfect pizza crust that is crunchy on the outside and fluffy on the inside covered with delicious fresh toppings. Cozy seating AND a full bar. This place is pizza perfection and you need to go here immediately. The mouthgasm is totally worth the drive.I used to live by this Humble Pie and never went. Now that I live downtown I finally make it there? Go figure. I met the venerable Richard Z for lunch today. The other leg of the "Tripod", Dallas G was missing. The place wasn't too busy for lunch, but it was about 130 so the lunch rush may have already ended. We sat out on the patio since it was a typical 70 degree December day. Nice patio that is probably perfect at night. The menu had salads, pastas, and of course pizzas. They offer a pretty good lunch special of an 8" pizza and salad for $8.95. They have specific pizzas for this on specific days, but our server said we could have any pizza we wanted. I give credit to Mr. Z and his charm for that. I decided on the Artichoke which had fontina and ricotta cheese, 3 different olives, and caramelized onions. I got the Veggie salad which had jicima, romaine, tomatoes, green beans, avacado, white beans, and fresh mozzarella with a herb vinagrette. The salad was very tasty. Z had the Cesar which he noted that the croutons were amazing. He subsequently bit his tongue in half following this statement. There was blood and everything.Our pizzas came out before we were done with the salads, which is a bit of a pet peeve of mine. Mine was very good, but I wish the crust wasn't as bready and a little more well done. Otherwise perfectly delicious. Z got the Egg pizza which had a sunny side up egg and panceta. He seemed very pleased with his selection. I could tell by the sounds coming from across the table. I also enjoyed one of the iciest Stellas I have ever had. Perfect for a day like today.Overall a very good experience and I would definitely come back to this location or any of the others throughout the valley. Well done Humble Pie.
Sadie's Soulful Southern=I had read about Sadie's a while back, and figured that we needed to check it out.  I might not be a true Southerner, but I'm getting there, having lived in the South for going on twenty years now.  I can enjoy some Soul Food with the best of them.The big problem that I have is that Sadie's, as much as the name would indicate and people would like to believe, doesn't really hit me as soul food.Yes, Tamara (Sadie was her grandmother) serves chicken and waffles.  But the waffles are sweet potato waffles with cinnamon and other spices (you do get these with chicken wings).  The waffles are served with pre-packaged butter and syrup, on paper plates with plastic utensils.  I don't mind that they use those, but rather than tossing the butter and syrup on the table, get a bottle of Aunt Jemima's and a nice dispenser.  Even better, buy some maple syrup from Cracker Barrel.  The Food Detectives showed how much presentation can change things, and it would make a huge difference here.Another thing is the menu itself.  There are items like red beans and rice and fried corn on the cob (which is excellent - at least as good as R&R in Concord).  But they also have a quesadilla.  Since when is that soul food?  It's not that it's bad, either.  In fact, it might be the best thing on the menu, which just makes matters worse.Sadie's does have some good tea (not quite as sweet as my granny's, but good), and overall the experience is solid.  But it's not great.  The main problem, other than the menu issues above, was service.  They might have been missing some staff or something, but service was SLOW.  When we came in, it took several minutes to even be greeted.  It was a long time after that to receive drinks, and we received our appetizer (the quesadilla) just as we were about to give up.  Our dinner came just a minute or so later, and that was when they weren't busy!  As we were leaving, things really picked up - though much of it was orders to go.
Blu Sushi=We will not be going back to Blu. I've said this before, but we always seem to get invited by different people, and we've given in. But this time, it's official, as I promised to write a review on behalf of 7 other people that were a part of our group on Friday night. There's no one left who would want to go back there amongst our group of friends. Our experience was so bad, it was surreal. Just some of the highlights:It should say something, when before even going in, when the other restaurant's on the same strip are on a wait and packed, and there are 3 guests in Blu at 6:30 on a Friday night. We committed to meeting a large party, though, so it worked for us, on this occasion.We went in, and our party got there at staggered times, couple by couple, which should have made it easy to keep things separate.  After 4 of us were there (2 couples), the server came up to us, and made a big deal about having separate checks. Keep in mind that there were a total of 7 guests in the whole restaurant at this point. She kept pointing out on the menu that their policy is that they won't do it. We didn't argue or really make much of a comment, but she kept repeating it to us. She finally said that they would do it, but with major protest to herself.At 7:00, a sushi chef came around, turned on a disco ball, and cranked the music so loudly (still, less than 10 guests in the whole place), it was difficult to hear each other across the table.  The 2 sushi chefs would frequently yell out (think hibachi) and partake in sake shots. During our 2 hours there, we saw one of the chefs (who referred to himself as Charlie) take at least 7 shots, growing louder and more obnoxious with each one. At one point, Charlie came over to our table started dancing ON one of the women with us, and asked who wanted to arm-wrestle.  One of our visiting guests, jokingly took him up on it, and ended up with Charlie taking him down on the floor, fully wrestling him, arm around his neck and (I'm not exaggerating) touching him inappropriately. Seriously.This is not even a reflection of the food...yet.  4 of the 8 of us ordered cooked rolls, which we have had in the past. Normally they take some time to get, but come out piping hot. This time, they were unrecognizable, and COLD. We actually asked the chef about it, and he went on a rant, about he doesn't make it the same way that they last chef did, and that his way was better. He actually said that the last chef was an a**hole, before he took the cold rolls away. When we were (oh so) ready to leave, we asked for our check(s). You could immediately tell this was stressful for our server, who disappeared for a solid 10 minutes, re-appeared to tell us she needed a break from our checks, and that she would be in the bathroom (necessary??), and returned another 10 minutes later. The total experience was bad enough, but finding out that the pricing had increased at least 20-30% with the new management, put the nail in the coffin. $11 dollars for a goose and soda? I would expect this pricing in Scottsdale or at a hotel, but in Litchfield Park, not at all. We will not be going back...don't even think about giving it a try. We have...multiple times. Service is always an issue, but this was above and beyond! There are much better sushi options in the West Valley!
Primarily Prime Rib Restaurant=We came here for dinner before a show.  We had no reservation but since it was only 5:30, we were seated promptly.  Our order for iced teas were taken promptly.  We were brought a basket of sliced bread and some butter.  My wife ordered the Cottage Pie with split pea soup for an appetizer.  I got the South Point cut of prime rib with a baked potato.  For my starter I got the prime salad with bleu cheese dressing.My wife enjoyed her soup.  My salad was tossed table side on a classic style steakhouse cart.  The greens and dressing were in the wooden bowl when he pushed the cart to the table.  He mixed the dressing and greens together.  It was quite good and a server gave me some freshly ground pepper.Our main courses arrived and my prime rib was very rare as I ordered.  My baked potato was loaded with butter and sour cream as I asked and I was given a side of creamy horseradish.  I opted not to get the blackened cajun thanks to Philip T's review.  I also don't like that the "blackening" process cooks the meat more than I care for.For dessert, my wife got the tartufo, a white chocolate and raspberry dessert that consisted of a ball of raspberry sherbet surrounded by some vanilla ice cream covered with white chocolate.  There were some fresh berries with it also.  I got the chocolate layer cake which was not a standard slice of cake but rather a two layer round cake frosted with chocolate and also served with fresh berries.The meal was good and service was very good.  Robert and Jayme made a good team for the table.  This was a good meal and something different to try.
Sweet Melindas=You know when you go on holiday to an exotic European city and you want to find the perfect restaurant off the beaten tourist-trail - an authentic neighbourhood, hidden up a tiny alley, best-food-in-the-City type places? Whilst Edinburgh is already full of amazing eateries and luckily is scarce in the Promenade / Plaza aforementioned types, finding Sweet Melinda's felt like I'd unearthed one of the Old Town's best kept secrets.Nestled in Marchmont in the innocuous spot between the fishmongers and fruit shops, and literally hidden behind a huge draping red curtain is the most wonderful wee restaurant, serving exquisite meals, that is both fine dining due to quality of food but also homely and friendly complete with creaky floorboards. It feels like eating in an old-fashioned dining room or a Parisian basement restaurant that was founded circa 1940s and hasn't changed much since (more to its benefit), and you half expect a man with an accordion to emerge from the waiting area to serenade you, and then once you've finished your meal to step out out of the restaurant onto the banks of the Seine.  A fish restaurant, there are also meat options, and everything is just wonderful.There were 5 in our party, and whilst we were told that we would only have the table from 7 - 9pm that wasn't a huge problem. We did overstay by about 15 minutes, as we were enjoying the cheese so much, but the staff were ever courteous and attentive, and apologetic. It's August in Edinburgh, we completely understood and weren't put out.The menu is a set two courses at £22. Whilst I appreciate that not everyone is willing to pay for two courses, I would say for the quality of the food it's good value. Despite there being 5 in our party, we all ended up ordering very similar meals. All of us had the squid salad to start, and there were 3 rack of lambs with sweet potato mash and black pudding, and 2 sea bass fillets.The lime and coriander dressing on the salad was beautiful, and there was a moderate portion of squid. But the rack of lamb. Oh my. I requested mine medium-rare but was told by the waiter this wasn't a problem as it's all served that way. And medium rare it certainly was. The black pudding was far too moreish, and the whole meal just cooked beautifully. (Check out the photos).The cheese board to finish, along with our port and whisky, was a wonderful way to wind up the meal. The dark chocolate truffle, evidently home-made,served with the coffees was, dare I say, orgasmic.I love the red, draping curtain concealing the entrance to the restaurant. And the curious antique photos and pictures on the wall. And the creaky floor boards. And the friendly staff. And the food. And the fact this is a real neighbourhood restaurant in Marchmont that is focusing on doing what it does best. The fact that it's a fish restaurant and I didn't have fish as my main means I simply need to go back... just have to find the occasion!
Restaurant Nilufar=How had I not discovered the $2 trio earlier? I will soon be duchess no doubt. The windows that line the front of the restaurant allow plenty of light despite it being slightly lower than street level. The cashier was a doll and you could tell by listening to her interactions with regulars that she's part of the charm and reason for the repeat business. I splurged the extra 25 cents for garlic sauce in my wrap and I would suggest you do the same. I was impressed at the significant choice of soups and was pleasantly surprised that they make a point of serving the juice in a larger-than-normal styrofoam cup rather than something that doesn't hold more than a juice-box. You won't find a better lunch for $2, that I can guarantee.As a fairly cheap and broke Concordia student, I like this place. I REALLY like this place.The 2$ trio became 2.50$ trio (including cheap drink in a styrofoam cup, a falafel sandwich and a soup of your choice). It is THE best quality/price Lebanese restaurant I ever set foot in.Granted, the portions seem smaller than other Lebanese restaurants but it's still at a higher quantity/price ratio that I've ever seen. The pitas are the freshest I've ever tasted and the service is fairly fast. The lady at the counter seems hateful towards life but is actually really friendly if you bother to throw more than a "Hi I'd like X, Y and Z please" at her.The place is kind of small and cramped but with those prices, it's to be expected. The chairs at the tables seemed to have been stolen at a local daycare center and the tables wobble.Recommended. :)
Harry's Lounge Tempe Mission Palm's Hotel=Harry's is a NO.I am often leery of restaurants in hotels but I thought in the Mission Palms it should be safe.  I stand corrected.Giving credit where credit is due, the service was friendly and attentive throughout the meal although at this point I am wondering if there was some duplicity going on here.  I'll return to that.I had the fish & chips.  It was both soggy and overdone.  To accomplish this you first have to cook it too long.  Then to get rid of the crispiness you have to cover it with something and let it sit a few minutes so that the food gets moist from condensation.  The fries were lukewarm and soggy.  After I ate I excused myself and went to the restroom to use some floss because the overdone fish had stuck between my teeth quite generously.  Uck.  But here's the real rub:  They added an 18% gratuity without saying anything.  In the semidarkness of the outdoor seating area I did not catch this and added in another roughly 18% tip.  Later as we were heading home and talking about dinner we realized it seemed kind of high.  We'll be addressing the bill with the restaurant and contesting the charges on the credit card.  In the meantime, be warned.  Seriously, wtf?Oh and parking is valet only and they were pretty disorganized.Update:  they refunded the charges.
Restaurant Juni=5 shining stars for Jun i. One of my top 3 meals this year.Sushi is fresh and inventive. No cream cheese rolls here. We had an Indian-inspired roll over a yogurt curry sauce and fought over the last piece.The kitchen specialties are pricey but completely worth it. Roasted scallop, langoustine and snapper over saffron scallop stock and parsley cream was the best thing I've had in my mouth in quite a while.Soups, tea and sake are also fantastic.Sleek, calming nature-inspired decor with cozy, (fake) furry-backed chairs.Perfection.A Sante~
Valvona & Crolla=I love good food. I love Italian food. Valvona & Crolla's is the epic Italian deli of Edinburgh, having been here for almost 100 years. The deli up the front of their original Elm Row branch is wonderous, like Willy Wonka's for meat, cheese and pasta lovers. I love it.The caffe bar up the back sells all their delicious food stuffs, which is good. So why the three stars?The boy and I came here for breakfast. A £30 breakfast is transpired. Yes, we weren't counting as we ordered but we normally order the same thing where ever we go and it usually ranges from £10 - £20. The usual being normally two types of cooked (poached eggs and bacon, or smoked salmon), a tea and coffee, and two OJs. The only difference here was the boy also ordered one of their fresh chocolate croissants for after (they are that good).So either the chocolate croissant was £10 good or their prices are just generally higher. I can't actually remember the individual prices, but paying £30 for two for breakfast is a wee bit much. The food really is great and they are an Edinburgh institution so I think the prices reflect this. But when I can get equally good cooked breakfast elsewhere at half the price..well you do the maths.The other thing that I don't know if they could change is the space itself. It only has sky lights so whilst there's light, there's no view. The decor is quite dated and the chairs and tables are spread out across a rectanguar floor in a very orderly order (ehh you know what I mean). It just feels a little soulless. This is a total contrast to the dark, high-ceilinged, meat-strewn deli up front. It just isn't somewhere I'd *want* to go for long leisurely brunch or lunch. Which is a real shame.Don't get me wrong, I love their deli, I like their other cafés (despite that they're also really pricey) and I love their food. But the prices are just too high and there are other places nearby with much more personality.
Hanny's=Back to my days as the doorman at the Wyndham across the street, I used to watch construction of this restaurant. Such a great old building, and I was so happy they were finally doing something with it. I've watched progress in person and in pictures, as well as chatted about it with my friends, and three years later it is finally something.The inside of the building is beautiful. Absolutely stunning. They did a great job with the old department store, and utilized a lot of space very efficiently. There are some neat touches here and there, one being the empty elevator shaft with a plexiglass cover, and some mirrors so you can seemingly see forever. It's not that deep! The restrooms upstairs (shame they are ALL upstairs) are awesome, in a white room surrounded with mirrors. I felt like I was in a padded asylum with mirrors, the asylum because I couldn't figure the place out. There is a DJ booth above the front door that is very easy to miss, and really a cool touch. The colors are all browns to keep with the nostalgic theme, and did I mention there are mirrors everywhere? The building and space get a 5. It's just cool.We sat at the bar and were followed by a friendly little asian guy, with menus and he seemed genuinely interested in us having a good experience. He was previously across the street asking people to come over and try the restaurant. I wish I could say the bartender was half as friendly or committed to his job. The bald one was extremely unfriendly, seemed very arrogant, and for a person in a loud restaurant should practice his vocal skills. The service was prompt without mishaps throughout, but very cold.I ordered the Carne Pizza. I have to say, it was one of the biggest disappointments I have had in a loooooong time. I have made better pizzas in my home oven that came from a box. Honestly... it had a paper thin cardboard like crust, no quality toppings, and not exactly a memorable taste. It tasted fine, and that was it's only redeeming quality. My neighbor had the roast beef sandwich and it was no better, or higher quality. The deli counter at Safeway can make a better sandwich. I earlier chastised someone for judging food on opening night, but now I see it really is bad, there is really no quality.  No sandwiches come with sides. No fries, no fruit, no salad, nothing. They are about $10, and if I want a great sandwich for $10 I'll go to Switch, and it will come with a great Caesar Salad on the side.This is not a restaurant, but rather a bar that serves food. If I think of it like that... more like a bigger version of The Roosevelt, I can think a little more positive about this, but not much. Bad service, bad food, bad review. I'll not be coming back, even with the walking distance proximity. It's just not worth it, especially for the price, and to feel like a not busy staff doesn't want to be busy. We are now at the point where there are other options downtown that are better. It's no longer a Downtown where you can be mediocre and survive.If you're a fan of AZ88 and are expecting Hanny's to be a downtown clone, you'll be partly pleased. The design, decor + ambiance will feel somewhat familiar, as will the quality of drinks at the bar (aside from much smaller martinis) - but the food at Hanny's is a strange departure from the top-notch bar food found at it's sister restaurant in Scottsdale.While still bar food, Hanny's offers an odd assortment of pizzas, sandwiches and salads. And not a big assortment, either. Everything we tried tasted OK, but sounded better on the menu than it actually was. Portions were also disappointing for the price, especially the chopped salad, which was half the size of the chopped at AZ88 - and half as good - for about the same price. The oven-fired pizzas had a nice thin, crispy crust, but toppings were just so-so and felt uninspired. Sandwich selections were more inspired, but only slightly appealing, from Charred Pork to the P.A.T., a fancy BLT made with pancetta and arugula. The Bar Plate was probably our favorite item, though still just OK - fresh prosciutto (sliced at the bar on a very cool Euro-style slicer), chunks of parmigiano-reggiano, slices of melon, and ciabatta bread - good, but nothing to write home about.What is worth writing about is the place itself - a must-see, and just what downtown needed. Sleek, urban and the coolest industrial rehabbing around - from the clever open elevator shaft to the maze of bathroom stalls. And once the rooftop patio and basement lounge open, this place will surely be the hottest spot in town.As for now, stop in, check it out, have a drink or two or three, and enjoy the beginning of a new era for downtown Phoenix. Just hope the menu improves with age...After Happy Hour last Friday the J-Man and I found ourselves not in the mood to go home, but in the mood to continue our fun out in downtown Phoenix. After meeting with 2 of the most bad ass Yelpers at our place- Stevey P and Mr. K- we headed out to Hanny's to meet with more of Yelp's best- Bonnie G., Erica O., and Lauren V. Hanny's proved to be a fun and interesting place for us to relax. We didn't try any of the food since we had eaten earlier but we sampled the drinks and explored the space. I ordered up a mojito, which came with an unexpected dark rum float on the top. It was strong on the liquor but not on the mint. Perhaps next time I'll try a mai tai. After that I sampled a drink brought over from AZ88, the Moscow Mule, which was very nice and refreshing. The bar area is nice and large, the bartenders friendly. The prosciutto slicer in the middle is, um, well its odd. The space is incredible. There are so many areas to explore, nooks and crannies to find. Some are cool (room of light and mirrors, white room, upstairs balcony, front part of the upstairs that overlooks Adams) some are creepy (the elevator shaft freaked me out, the stairs up to who knows whereâ) However, its clear that the space was a department store. The central bar on the main floor was obviously the cosmetics counter and my husband kept getting whiffs of a floral smell, which I have to assume was the ghost of a crazy perfume lady past. I think Hanny's has great potential...there are no other places like it downtown. It just needs people. So please, everyone go there. When do you hear me say that in a Yelp review? Never. But Hanny's is within walking distance of my place and could be a great destination downtown when one wants to enjoy a night at a nice lounge.Check out the "Tongue" couch and stand on the glass floor look down the abandoned elevator shaft, trippy to say the least. Great addition to downtown.  Sleek and contemporary interior.  Soon  they may have a club downstairs according to our server.  Upstairs is a neat, albeit slightly odd space.  They have a DJ in a small room over the main entrance, look for him.TRY THE BAR PLATE!!!  It's about $7 and you get fresh shaved Parmesan and prosciutto, melon and bread.   It's so F'ing good.They have Pimm's, but I don't know to much about it but it tasted OK to me.---IMPORTANT: the "pizzas" are not normal, they are super thin, I mean like 1/2 of a tortilla thin.  Tasty, but not a filling as a normal thin crust pizza.Darn snazzy place.So, it can ONLY be a good sign when you walk into a place and see a giant wheel of Parmigiano-Reggiano, right? I mean, I'm pretty certain this Italian girl could sustain herself on one of those perfectly-aged, salty wheels for, like, at least 6 months! So, I was DELIGHTED when that was the first thing to catch my eye upon entering Hanny's this past weekend.Then, to be able to enjoy a Pimm's Cup No. 1 (Corbin's Bar & Grill is the only other place I've found it as prominently displayed in the Valley). Pimm's Cup No. 1 is an English gin-based, slightly spiced and citrus flavored liqueur. The version offered on the drink list at Hanny's is a gingery, cucumbery, bitters-like concoction. I spent the summer of 2006 drinking Pimm's lemonade, so was excited to hear Hanny's has fresh squeezed lemonade.  But, I found their lemonade to be too sour and will probably stick with the standard Pimm's Cup next time I'm there.As for the ambiance, I liked it. It felt crisp and contemporary to me. Also, unfinished... which it is. I'm looking forward to watching this place develop!My 4 stars for Hanny's are driven almost completely by the atmosphere of this converted department store. A friend and I met up for drinks there last Friday, and lingered for around 5 hours (another friend was flying in from NYC and his flight was delayed several times, so the rounds kept coming). Several people have commented negatively on the service, lighting or music, but they must be working out the kinks with all of the above because they were spot-on during our visit. The DJ was spinning a combination of subtle vibe-enducing music mixed with "oh, I LOVE this song" uncovered and unexpected old favorites. The lighting gradually shifting during the evening, so that by midnight it was a cozy and romantic mood. Speaking of, let me just say it: something about this place just felt...sexy. I don't know if it was the music, the lighting, the "baby it's cold outside" week before Christmas, or my malbec-shiraz. The things-could-happen-here feel especially hit me when I went upstairs and saw the unisex restrooms all lined up; white unmarked doors all in a row to their own little rooms -- it was straight out of a Madonna video circa 1995! Biggest watchout: the martini glasses were offensively and ridiculously tiny. I mean, really?!? I had read about this in reviews before going, but I was so shocked at the size that I refused to order one and stuck with wine (which I wouldn't say was a "healthy" pour, but at least took me more than 4 sips to finish). The menu is also relatively limited. We shared the bar plate and a prosciutto pizza (added mushrooms) and enjoyed both, but neither were outstanding or very filling. All-in-all, I will definitely recommend this place to friends for drinks or drinks/apps. It's a unique space with a great vibe and I am sure it will do well once word gets out.200th review! And on the last day of December 2008, of all days. 2008 was a great year for Phoenix Yelp but not for Phoenix itself as one local business after another closed its doors and efforts to revitalize downtown didn't do so well. Anyone who attended the downtown pub crawl can attest to that. I really believe that 2009 can be a better year for Phoenix, though, and I think that the light rail being open (and creating a flow up and down the central corridor) will definitely help. The other thing I think will help is entrepreneurs like Karl Kopp (the owner of Hanny's) being willing to take risks and open businesses that may not necessarily fit the cookie cutter mold of what a "cool" Phoenix establishment should be. I really applaud him for that. In some sense, opening a business that's different than what people are used to or expect helps you create a cult following--not everyone will like you, but if enough people refuse to listen to the other people who don't like you, you will create a pretty passionate crowd of supporters. I really think that Hanny's will gain this type of cult following and then over time, as similar types of businesses gain a footing in Phoenix, it will become a place everyone accepts. Or that won't happen and I'll pray that enough people start to see the magic so that Hanny's won't be the next business to close!In case you think that I only like Hanny's because it's different or new, I want to emphasize that I also really liked the food and drinks my husband and I tried. Yes, the martinis were small (my husband had the special Hanny's martini with vodka and gin and I had a French martini), but they were mixed well and at only $5, my husband's was well priced for the size. We also both thought the food was really well executed. We especially loved the pizza with prosciutto and arugula. The crust was definitely too thin even for "Roman style"--having been to Rome five times, I can tell you that the crust there has a bit more substance to it, but the ingredients on Hanny's pizza were simple and fresh, which I know to be an authentically Italian approach to pizza making. But I can see how you might be disappointed if you are used to very saucy and savory pizza. The pork loin sandwich was also really good--the thinly sliced pork was very flavorful and the bread was nice and crusty. The green peppers were a bit strange, though, as they made the pork taste more Mexican inspired than Italian. That being said, though, I'm kind of content overall to not try to force Hanny's into a box. What I like about the place is its slight imperfections and its inability to be easily defined. Is it a bar? a restaurant? a lounge? I don't really know, but I don't really care. I think its unique character make it a great destination for those who are looking for something different in Phoenix, and I hope that it survives the economic slump that the city has been going through. If it does, maybe it will expand its offerings and become a place that everyone can appreciate.Hanny's ... you have quite the tasty Riesling. But...your service leaves a tad bit to be desired.On the flip side, you have hot hot hot bartenders, so I really don't mind the wait (sorry DG).My favorite thing about you is your bathrooms. I mean, I really really love the bathrooms. Actually, I love the entire place. If I were going to open a bar, I would want it to look exactly like Hanny's. Well, except the meat cutter at the bar, because I am vegetarian. Perhaps I would get an industrial strength cheese cutter. (ha ha ... cheese cutter!)Ooooo another bonus... you are right off of the light rail and you normally have parking available right outside... therefore I consider you to be in a good location.Yeah, Hanny's ... I love you. Quite a bit. Let's go steady.3.5I'm a fan, but not a devout fan. So I guess that rounds down to 3 stars.I have visited Hanny's twice. I LOVE the building, and the modern/wacky decor. I would imagine this place packed full if it were in NYC. I was there last Friday and I loved the vibe that the DJ created while he chose to spin soulful R&B. It was great. Our server, Tyrone, was a rock star. He handled our large group without a problem and he was quick with the service. Everyone at the table decided to order something and then pass it around. I had the pizza with pepperoni and onion, which was tasty. I think everything was great. The loser of the evening was the onion strings. I really wouldn't waste your time unless you were madly craving a whole plate of onion strings. I know people have complained about the teeny-tiny martinis. Don't judge too quickly. Those little things actually pack a good punch.What I don't love is the VERY limited and unimaginative menu. Listen up people, you can only do thin crust pizzas, and paninis at so many places before the trend wears out. Hanny's menu is so limited that I couldn't see myself going to eat there very often because I would be eating the same things. I really hope they expand their menu. Maybe offer a nightly special? Is that asking too much? I will most certainly go to Hanny's again. I don't know if I would go for dinner necessarily, but it's a great place to start the night out in Downtown Phoenix!Hanny's is two things..and neither at full potential.1st, it is very chic and modern in a retro feel. as far the the interior style and potential i give it 5 stars. i was told the basement will be a full blown dance club in the future. but for now..this place is completely underused. there is a second bar upstairs, but on a friday night i counted more open tables then filled ones..so clearly the second bar is premature.2nd, the pizza tastes good, the flavor i thought was there. but give me a fucking break, 17 bucks for a crispy saltine baked at 600 degrees with some toppings...drinks were strong..saving grace on the menu side of this review. but i think the pricing is seriously out of wack for what you get.no free birthday dessert...better and lesser places have no problem doing this. hell if i was a server..i would have compped it either way..it was a table of 10 people drinking and my tip alone was 40 bucks. not to mention the unrequested table bread....that was put on my bill..WHAT THE FUCK!!!it will be awhile before i come back to Hanny'slike i said the potential for a 5 star awesome place is there. but seriously the clown menu needs some revisions..if you want to charge this much for dining, get a real menu deserving of it. hopefully the wait staff too. at one point in the night i saw 3 servers standing around by the main entrance. look busy asshole. coolest thing would be the DJ nest over the dining area. also the bathrooms, which i believe used to be dressing rooms. i can totally see some awesome carnal experiances in these private bathrooms. but i think it's kinda weird the bathrooms are 20 feet from the upstairs bar..and in line of sight...Hanny's i wish you the best..and hope you can grow up to be what you want to be. send me a kite when you do..i look forward to hearing from you.What a cool spot! Came here the other night for a drink and was pleasantly surprised that a place that used to be a clothing store could be turned into such a charming lounge. Feeling a little adventurous, and because I freakin' LOVE Brazilians, I opted for the Capiriana.. Fortunately, the bartender did not disappoint because these can be hit or miss. It even came with a sugar stick lolly-pop, pink I may add, so that was pretty neat. Feeling the munchies come on, I ordered the snack plate, which came with a variety of sliced meats and cheeses, along with pistachios, bread & olives.. perfect for sharing too! The interior is huge, and very open.. I love that the bar is situated directly in the middle too, friendly bartenders and tons of seating. . Unfortunately I didn't venture to the bathroom, which is supposed to be a site to see.. maybe next time.We were downtown chic last week and attended a Mercury game (VIP I might add...for whatever that's worth!) and dined afterward at Hanny's. WOW! Walking in I felt the heaven's had opened and the choir was a-singin'! This space should be my home. Beautiful, modern decor with the right lighting casting a soothing blanket of warmth. Nice. Greeted immediately we sat at a high top table near the window. I was so consumed with the fabulous company I was with I hadn't realized something. We. Were. The. Only. Diners. A few bar flies scattered around the bar in the middle of the room. 9:15 on a Thursday. My heart sank. Or was I actually slipping off the bar stool from those two $9 beers from the Mercury game? The good:Well, service was swift and friendly. Though he seemed a tad nervous. Perhaps because we smelled of lesbians. Not sure. Ambience. Duh! Covered that. Including the restrooms and the glassed in elevator shaft. I still get dizzy just thinking of that!PIZZA. Yep. I never would order pizza in a non pizza place. Rickie did. Rickie won. Rickie ate. Carne pizza. Order it!The bad:TINY martinis. Who makes these? Barbie? Tattoo from Fantasy Island? The Lucky Charm leprachaun?Empty room. Bummer. I like a good, energetic, lively vibe. But we did entertain ourselves with lively banter about nothing important and most certainly became shallow and caddy. Realllllly, makes you want to hang out with me, eh?The ugly:My sandwich. The prime rib, with thick slabs o bacon, fried egg on ciabatta. Steak Umms. Was all I could compare it to. So disappointed. One thin, thin, thin, strip of, er, um, prime rib *cough* *cough* Steak Umms. Dry. Bland. Overcooked. Like my Aunt Helen after too much Chardonnay at a backyard BBQ. Onion strings, however, FANTASTIC.My other diner/Mercury fans were OK with their sandwiches; I remember one had pork the other hard boiled eggs. Not sure exactly. Sorry. Those $9 beers really did a number on me. The good Part 2 Electric Boogaloo:Onion strings! Had to repeat. I WILL GO BACK TO YOU HANNY'S. It was sort of like an awkward first date. Started off dicey. In the middle we had some laughs and wiped mayo from our lips. But did we kiss at the end of the night? Hmmm...not so sure. Let's see what happens on that second date.I really like Hanny's, even after my most recent experience there.  The bottom line is that Hanny's is a great place with good food and terrific classic-style cocktails.  The Pimm's Cup is fantastic, for example.  The DJ deserves mad props as well, and the whole place is fairly gorgeous.  I love the decor and the reclining booths.  Basically this is a great spot for a bite and a couple drinks.  I've had a couple pizzas, a sandwich, and a taste of the cauliflower veggie plate, and while nothing was exactly stand-out awesome, (although now that i say that my mind goes back to the meat-lovers' pizza i sampled and my mouth starts watering...) i would order any of it again.  The one uneven spot has been the service.  The first time i was ever here, only a month ago, we were served by a novice, and it showed.  painfully so.  the times i've visited since, we've had experienced servers who have done their job pretty well.I am in love with Hanny's.  They now have a new upscale classic drink menu that is on the pricey side, but looks AMAZING.  So far, I've tried the English Garden, which supplants any other mixed drink I've had as the best summer beverage.  It's 13 dollars, and contains the perfect proportions of Hendrick's Gin, St. Germain liqueur, and muddled cucumber.  Quite refreshing, strong, and yet incredibly quaffable.  Check it out.This place is so sexy.I actually spent my most recent birthday celebration here with some great friends because the days of parading around half-naked in nightclubs are a tad behind me now. They have an amazing drink menu here. The Moscow Mule comes in an adorable copper cup that makes you want to commit a small crime. I would also definitely recommend the St. Germain. It's a sweet martini, but one of the best I've ever had. This place also makes me want to buy a meat slicer and a slab of prosciutto for my own home.  Hanny's is definitely one of Phoenix's finest gems. It has a great deal of personality. Drinks, food, and tunes are always fantastic. See you there!Recently visited Hanny's for the first time and received crap service from a waitress with an attitude. She was not willing to happily accommodate any requests and acted put-off at anything we asked about or asked for. Plus, the place wasn't even busy while we were there, it was pretty empty. That's how you drive customers away.I went to the restaurant and my party spent over $300. My phone was stolen in the restroom with the district manager Alex less than 5 ft away. I asked for him to please make an announcement, or call my ph to see whom answered. He refused stated " It would kill his ambiance" and walked away. He refused to allow me to use the restaurant phone to call the police to file a report, he refused to provide me with the ownersw name or any contact info, he did not allow his staff to give me their names. The waitress actually said he was horrible to work with and apologized to me but she needed her job so she could not side with me in front of him. Actually Alex called the police ON ME as a trespasser. The police apologize to me when they arrived. Alex lied to the police and treated me like a dog. I will never frequent that restaurant again.I walked in with a 4-star expectation and walked out with an exhausted jaw.  :-\"Can I get some fabric softener up in here, please?!"  Why?"Cuz this son of a b*tch is hard as hell to eat!"Never again shall I torture myself through that.  *_*On paper, the roast beef sandwich sounded like a home run.  Who doesn't like roast beef that is griiiilllled? complemented with fried egg and bacon.It didn't help that the ciabatta was just as tough to chew.  Boy, was it a loooong lunch.  One bite after another, thinking about all the starving children of the world.  I'm doing it for you guys, you hear me?! You guys!!!Alas, I finished every single bite.  A few things that could improve this sandwich: use butter, perhaps make the meat a little rare, and use softer bread!The only thing that saved this whole lunch was their homemade doughnuts.  It was soft and airy complemented with their fresh strawberry sauce and chocolate.Another fail was trying to find their restroom, which I never found! I was told to head up the stairs and through mirrored hallway?! As contemporary as this place was, this creepy area I went to just did not fit the picture.  I eventually came across this narrow hallway with mirrors all around and then all of sudden it got bright with a bunch of doors.  I seriously felt like I was at a carnival and I was suppose to choose, Door #1, Door #2, or Door #3.  Where the freak did I end up? Did I just enter the Twighlight Zone? Doo-dee-Doo-Doo...Doo-dee-Doo-Doo#creepyHanny's is hidden in the midst of Downtown Phoenix and I believe it was one of the first "trendy" restaurants to hit Downtown Phoenix. I've visited a couple of times for cocktails and then more recently for food. The atmosphere, cocktails and overall lay-out is cool, but the food is just A-ok as is the service. The service was pretty slow-moving and we soon learned that this is probably not the best spot to stop by if you're on a time limit. The food itself is decent, but the selections to choose from on the menu are pretty random. I couldn't quite pin point the type of cuisine this restaurant would be categorized as, but it's a hefty selection of Mediterranean eats such as prosciutto, cheeses, paninis and pizzas. The pizzas are only around $11 and they are easily able to be shared. The salads are also pretty large in size and could easily be shared as well. In summary, this is a good spot to have a couple after-work cocktails and maybe stay for an appetizer or two, but I'll probably keep Hanny's at just that for me and choose another location for my meal, especially if I have to be somewhere! *** If you visit be sure to visit the bathrooms on the second floor. It's like walking into an Alice in Wonderland maze.Well Hanny's. Since that first, really, rather awkward first date we had, I'm pleased to say that you have won my heart. I've been back many times since and have some delicious and playful culinary delights to please my Culinary Comedian palate.From the bruschetta to your steak and your awesome Manhattan's...you most deservedly earn at least one extra star. Loving the banquettes with the backs that ever so slightly recline. Think airplane seat recline. But with more leg room. And better food. Though I must say, the restrooms on an airplane, though small, are more convenient than yours. What is it? The fifth floor? Sixth? I forget.Loving you Hanny's. Dare I say we are actually dating now? The real deal? Next time I see you let's hug and I'll give you a little slap on the ass!I have been a frequent goer to this restaurant while living in the city and while the food and drinks are great, the service is absolutely terrible. I have never met such an overly arrogant and prideful staff. They feel that as long as you have a minor issue, it is your fault and not theirs. For example, my friend specifically asked for the midnight martinis, it is 12:02 PM. She serves us full sized martinis. My friend was a little concerned that the waitress didn't hear us correctly, and to make sure we were not being charged full priced, she flagged the waitress over to which she says "those are full priced martinis." My friend proceeds to state that we have specifically requested midnight martinis to which the waitress responds "I didn't hear you.". So instead of apologizing for the misunderstanding and offering the midnight specials, she retaliates and gets defensive. Because of her incompetence, we request to speak to the manager to which he towers over the table and asks "What's going on here?". oh hi, nice to see you too. He didn't even introduce himself properly nor professionally. I was so turned off by the negative and defensive attitude, that I have just about had it with that place. IT is not the first time I have received this poor service, and they need to get off their high horse and get their game together. Sorry i'm not sorry Hanny's, but we're going to have to part ways.What is a huge turn off of all, is knowing that after scrolling through these reviews, 1 out 5 customers are very unhappy with the service provided and almost all have the same context, "servers and waitstaff are rude". I am pleading out to the owner of Hanny's: For the sake of you're great restaurant, please hire new management and waitstaff, they are making you look horrible!!!**Warning****Warning****Warning**This review is NSFW (Not Safe For Work). You might just end up reading it, calling in sick, *cough*, *cough*, catching a ride (cab, light rail, uber, lyft, friend, bicycle, skateboard, roller skates, shoes, or slippers) and spending your day at Hanny's instead.Hanny's has a special place in my heart. Oh, Hanny's. You're close enough to my house to be an easy light rail destination, and just far enough for me to stay away most of the time. "Dangerous curves ahead" doesn't even begin to cover the tepidness one should take while ordering your $5 martini's, especially when you order them on the rocks, in a tumbler glass, and a couple of limes to dress it up instead. Your $5 martini special is always special and that's just why I like you, you make every hour happy and not just the hours between 3pm and 6pm ;-)The one complaint I hear from most people and many reviews is that at Hanny's, there's no Happy Hour, I think you just have to know to order their $5 martinis. I generally consider happy hours to be happy only when they come coupled with a decent drink selection AND food selection, but those martini's, they make up for it.Happy Yelping Phoenix, set your limit at two, possibly even one, be sure you've got a DD and have the happiest of hours.Been in a few times now and have had fun every time. Love the food, love the drinks, hate the service. The best thing I have to say is this place is amazingly consistent. If you loved a drink or menu item before you'll love it again because it's totally consistent.  The service is also consistent in making you feel like a total bother. They're not all out rude but there's no hiding that they'd rather be somewhere else.
Red Ribbon Bakeshop=I had heard of this bakery from a competitor who holds shop in Chandler.  I have fond memories of delicious cakes from Red Ribbon from birthday parties of years past back home.   Filipinos LOVE to throw a party, and I swear cakes from Red Ribbon were always present.  You can imagine the nostalgia that swept over me, then, when I finally found this bakeshop situated near the food court in Arizona Mills.The shop looked so pretty- all lit up and all these enticing baked goods wrapped in plastic/cellophane with candy-red printing.  (Hmm... an alarm went off in my head after seeing them all wrapped up.)  The shop looked very clean, with welcoming tables and chairs, and my, how lovely those cake rolls look in the case!  Imagine, then, my disappointment upon reading the nutrition info on these plastic-wrapped goods to find that most, if not all, items are made with margarine, not butter.  These baked goods failed the "farm vs. factory" test- ingredients listed sound more like they're mechanically-produced in a factory rather than being all-natural, such as "flour, eggs, butter, milk," etc.  Before sampling what I must admit was a delicious morsel of mocha crunch cake, I asked if the frosting contained powdered sugar.  The sales clerk looked at his coworker, whom I assumed is a manager, who looked at him, then looked at me, and then said "We think it's whipped cream."  Think??  How can you not know what ingredients are used in the products you sell?  I also inquired if any items are made on-site.  No, he said.  Everything is shipped/trucked in, and the only preparations done at the bakeshop are the frying- the FRYING- of the empanadas and the re-heating of the siopao and noodle dishes.  Sorry Red Ribbon, but this Filipina only wants goods baked with butter, not margarine.  I said BAKED, not fried.  With the exception of the pie shell used in the egg pie, all of the pastries served at Manila Bakery are made on-site, so you won't find preservatives listed in the ingredients, as well.  My fond memories of those cakes will have to be just that, memories.  All the better when it comes to those twice-daily weigh-ins...
Teriyaki Madness=This place is decent if you want that teriyaki fix. I usually get the two item combination plate. Its your choice of any two meats. Comes with steamed rice and salad. I usually get brown rice instead of white and macaroni salad instead of their basic house salad.I paid a total of 10.53 for this meal. That doesn't include drinks. You would think that paying 10 bucks for lunch would get you somewhat of nice size portion but I finished my meal with no problem. I think they don't give you enough meat and the rice was like two small scoops. They also charge you extra for brown rice. Dont get me wrong. The food is good but the portions and the price gets two stars subtracted. Also a couple times my coworkers got food poisoning after eating here for dinner. They were up at 4 in the morning hanging out in the bathroom. Im surprised I havnt got sick yet for I have eaten here several times. I think sometimes they cook the meats too fast and not cook it long enough. Service is ok and the overall size of the place is pretty good to handle the lunch and dinner crowds. They are kind of tucked away in a plaza just off the 215 and Stephanie exit. So overall, If I can just get a little more food for the price I pay that would make things perfect. Either that or lower the price a bit because spending 10 bucks for lunch a day is considered a luxury for some people.Madness in a bowl!This location is nearby on the corner of Stephanie and Paseo Verde.  Since it's in the same parking lot as Eos Gym, there were many gym goers stopping in. The dining area is clean.  Not a very large area with tables but it seemed there were a lot of carry out orders so it was fine.  Service was fine- orders were correct and made in a reasonable amount of time.  I have been on a tofu kick so I wanted to try their Tofu Bowl.  I chose brown rice and vegetables to be included.  The bowl is plenty for me.  There was a good amount of tofu as well as fillers.  It was actually pretty decent.  I wouldn't mind ordering it again when I'm in the tofu mood.  For a quick and easy meal, Teriyaki Madness is good for me.
Dragon House Chinese Buffet=Sure, you can find places in Charlotte that have cook-to-order food along with a buffet (think Chen's Bistro or China One).  Unfortunately those places lack something - usually you can't communicate with the chef, or if you do, the chef mixes your order with someone else's, or you can't add the meat yourself.  Something is always missing.  Not at Dragon House.Don't get me wrong - this isn't strictly Mongolian BBQ - but it's awfully close.  You get a buffet line dedicated solely to the BBQ line, with a number of veggies and lo mein.  You get chicken, beef, shrimp, (possibly imitation) crab and something that appeared to be a sort of seafood.  You get at least a half-dozen sauces.  Throw whatever you want in a bowl, put it in the queue, and come back a few minutes later and it'll be piping hot, ready for you to eat.  Sweet!To make things even better, there are three lines of regular buffet fare to keep you busy while you wait, and a fourth line that holds a few sushi items and desserts - even a soft-serve ice cream machine.The buffet food isn't the best I've had, but it's far from the worst.  You'll find bite-sized appetizers (the dumplings are good) and typical entrees too (the coconut shrimp was my favorite), but it's the BBQ that I enjoyed the most.  Since BD's shut down a few years ago, it's what I've been craving, and now it's back.  If you don't want the pressure, the buffet is quite decent, and the price isn't bad either.  Service is good, but beware that you might see a line at busy times of the day.
WaffleS Cafe=So you won't believe how I ended up here. Somehow I had it in my head that the Wild Wild West was the hidden gem of Vegas buffets. Well, when Jamie W. and I drove there, we discovered that it was a tired motel filled with frog-voiced smokers next to a Denny's. Surely my mind was playing tricks on me. As I realized much later, it was Sam's Town I was looking for, but regardless, we were jonesing for breakfast. Thanks to the trusty Yelp app on my iPhone, we zeroed in on WaffleS Cafe. Surprise, surprise...it's in a strip mall just like almost every non-Strip eatery in town. It really looks like a smoothie shop since I couldn't tell if they even had a kitchen. The overhead menu would have you believe it's a virtual waffle-palooza in there. Perhaps but I didn't hear the sound of a griddle or the plop of the batter, which made me think the waffles are made elsewhere and heated up in the back. It was just too quiet in there. Anyhow, both of us went for the $5.49 Breakfast Special - which consisted of a large, round waffle; a couple of eggs; bacon or sausage; and a cup of coffee. I ordered the pumpkin waffle and had blueberries and whipped cream placed on top. It was good, and the meaty sausage and scrambled eggs helped a lot. Jamie showed greater forbearance and had his pumpkin waffle plain with a pat of butter, but he weakened and went for the bacon. All in all, it didn't feel substantive enough to be the breakfast we desired, but it did tie us over until the dogs we had at Pink's for lunch. Not because of the server, who was quite nice and cheery, but I doubt if I'll be back simply because it is slipping from my memory as I write this. FOOD - 3 stars...nice large Belgian-style waffles but the oomph factor seemed missing AMBIANCE - 3 stars...surely they sell Jamba Juice here, don't they? SERVICE - 4 stars...peppy and responsive TOTAL - 3 stars...just not quite memorable enough for me to return for a waffle
Cafe Monarch=Guess I'm the first... brace yourself.... I'm feelin chatty.Café Monarch is exactly what we've been looking for in Old Town. I don't know if there is a term for what this place is... kinda bistro, kinda café, kinda semi-private dining room: a castro privé? a bafé? Whatever it is, it feels like home.THE PLACEThe Monarch resides in a small, charming building with its own lot. The style is rustic, cozy and clean modern at the same time. A well-equipped, open chef's kitchen greets you on the left as you enter. There are a few tables inside, tucked into niches. There is one very clean and beautifully done bathroom. The design/decor is impeccable and creative. You can tell how much thought and detail went into the space. There is nothing about it that says "turn-key restaurant operation". And best of all this time of year, a fantastic patio, candle-lit, dark and surrounded by great plantings. There is no way I would refuse the patio, unless soft-ball sized hail was in the forecast.HOW IT WORKS (based on our first visit)We had some idea what to expect: the place is an extension of the man, the chef/owner - Chris. Whatever he has decided to purchase, is what's for dinner. Just an oral menu. He tells you what he's got on hand and runs it past you. I expect, if you had some special needs, or even objections, he could easily offer up alternatives. Everything sounded great to everyone in our party, so he just started bringing stuff out at a leisurely pace. L-e-i-s-u-r-e-l-y. Which was exactly what we wanted. We were in no rush. You shouldn't be for an experience like this. The pace is like a large family meal in Europe. Prepare to relax and enjoy each course on its own.An important note: it's BYOB for wine&beer, which we love. If you know what you like to drink, BYOB is a joy. There are numerous wine shops near Old Town to grab something on the way.THE FOODIt was excellent. Everything fresh. Hearty, layered flavors. Generous portions. Expertly prepared, but with the welcome rough edges of a gourmet meal at someone's home. Although I guess it varies daily, here is roughly what we had: - a hummus salad(?) loaded with good stuff served with hearty, crunchy hearth crackers. - warm, baked goat cheese surrounded by sauteed grapes(!) and greens with rustic bruschetta, crunchy on the outside and chewy in the middle. - some sort of chunky beef soup, with mediterranean/moroccon tones - a meal in itself. - a GIANT rack of grilled lamb. giant. seems like colorado lamb, due to the size of the ribs and the tenderloin and the pleasant gaminess. 6 huge chops. nicely balanced between sweet and savory, not some horrible overpowering chutney. personally, i like a more herby, garlic, salty approach with no sauce. but it was awesome. - dessert? maybe? i was way into the wine by then. i always skip dessert. i think gelatos and strawberries.IS IT FOR YOU?Hopefully! But I could see how Café Monarch is not for everyone. If you're generally fussy, or antsy or uncomfortable if you're not being ushered from activity to activity, stay away. If you are excessively picky and have trouble finding something you like even on a large menu, stay away. If you like Olive Garden pasta, are sad about losing Bennigan's or if french fries are your favorite French food, stay away. Although I bet he makes some bitchen french fries.I hope for your sake, it's for you. But if it doesn't sound like your type of experience, I wouldn't try to force yourself into it. There's an Outback nearby that's got a beeper with your name on it.IMPORTANT NOTES - do not come for "a quick bite" - this will be your evening (or your morning i guess). - again, BYOB. bring plenty.  - currently, there is lunch service on weekdays, and breakfast/brunch on weekends, dinner is only Friday & Saturday. not sure if there is a closed day. - no cheesecake factory menu of 1000s here, you're eating what Chris is making. - call ahead, or you may arrive to be greeted by a "Sorry, we're off catering!" sign.I'll be back, and update as needed!Wow. Did brunch today, as opposed to dinner from the previous review.Outstanding. 3 little waffles with fresh berries and a lemon-pistachio butter(?). Best waffles I've ever had. Light and crispy on the outside. And not just "fluffy" on the inside. More unique - almost like a popover texture in the middle. Not overly sweet, just the crispy, moist waffles with natural sweetness from the berries and a handmade syrup from fruit.Then a whole nother course: scrambled eggs on top of melting gouda, next to toast with pesto and artichoke hearts, bacon and chicken breast stuffed with sausage.Either one of these courses could have been my whole brunch. But I couldn't resist eating both. Thank god we rode bikes there and back, and then rode again later to dinner with friends in the hood.And great news! Smokehouse Sunday is theoretically starting next Sunday at 11am. (for future reference: this review is from Oct 2008)Cafe Monarch is romantic, quaint, charming, and quirky...a nice change of place and pace in Scottsdale. The chef, Chris, cooks with love and artistry from the moment he greets you to the moment he serves you. My salmon dish was prepared perfectly (I told him I wanted something healthy) with a blend of mixed vegetables. It just wasn't the meal itself that was good, but the presentation and portion of my meal. Too bad I didn't have my camera with me, but it was beautiful. He then surprised me with a small slice of bread pudding for dessert soaked in (vanilla?) cream sauce. Is he a mind reader, too? Bread pudding is one of my favorite desserts.The one thing that makes this place so unique is that there's only one chef and maybe another server to help him out. Remember, patience is a virtue. Don't expect a large menu, though, because there isn't one. Simply displayed on a chalkboard are a few items you can choose from for lunch. I will definitely be back to enjoy his brunch.Oh! And for those of you not in the know. I love (addicted) to coffee and I kid you not...my coffee mug was never empty. Chris kept that baby and my caffeine levels loaded. Maybe I should marry this guy?Another dinner to leave me slouched back in my chair with my hand on my belly, a stupid grin on my face and a contented sigh on my lips.  I brought Ada G., Elaine B. (formally known as P - I kind of like her "formally known as P) and B here for dinner on Thursday night as I've been talking about it for so long, they wanted to know what all the hubbub was about since I couldn't stop talking about the roll-your-eyes-back-in-your-head brunch I had here last Spring so we finally made reservations and off we went.When you make reservations at Cafe Monarch, you want to let Christopher know if you have any food aversions or allergies, or maybe even if you're really counting on something in particular that night so he can plan in advance.  He shops for the freshest produce and selections for the night are restricted.  That being said, I wish more places did it this way.  It's tiring to flip through pages and pages of menus of nearly identical items.  I'd just as soon be told the chef bought the freshest items possible that day and this is what inspired him or her and this is what will be served tonight.  Will this suffice?  Why yes, yes it does!  Thank you.  Do you understand my point?We brought along a couple of bottle of champagne and a white and red.  It's all BYO here and we figured we'd hedge our bets not knowing what we'd be in the mood for.  (By the way, it's also cash or check also - no credit cards) We started with some champagne and Christopher told us for dinner he had in mind a penne pasta with a pumpkin cream sauce, toasted walnuts and sliced Gorgonzola on top.   For the next course we would have a warm salad of fresh artichokes, olives and peppers and for the main course was a beer braised chicken.  All of it sounded fabulous to us, of course none of are picky eaters.  Isn't it just more fun to dine with good eaters?  Pretty much anything he would have made, we would have ate.  No food aversions at our table!  (Innards.  I take that back.  I don't like innards.)We enjoyed our champagne while he worked on the pasta.  The smells coming from the kitchen were just intoxicating.  The restaurant itself is so cozy too.  We sat inside this time and the best I can describe it is a cross between a French bistro and Buca di Beppo.  OK.  Total disservice to Cafe Monarch but he has the coolest things all over his walls like Buca di Beppo does.  As for the rest, I could swear I was back in a cafe in Paris.  Our pasta came out heaped on a platter family style.  The sauce was a lovely pale pumpkin hue accented with fresh herbs and lovely, pungent slices of Gorgonzola and crunchy walnuts it was pitch perfect.  We all ate as much as we dared while Christopher came and entertained us with his stories.  In most restaurants when the owner or manager comes by to see if everything is OK that's all fine and dandy but you usually don't want them hanging around spouting their propaganda, but with Chris it's the complete opposite.  You don't want him to go!  You wish you could eat with him every night.  He told us about growing up, what he did last summer, he joked around with us girls, commented on Ada G's. cowgirl sheik attire (I'll let her go into that) and even explained to me exactly how he made a couple of the dishes.The warm salad served next came in a small, cast iron skillet.  Baby sliced artichokes were sautéed with capers, sweet Italian peppers, heirloom tomatoes and thyme.  It was light, flavorful and a welcome departure to the typical green salad I've been eating all summer.Our final course was fit for a small village.  A platter of chicken pieces all beautifully browned and braised in Full Sail Ale.  The braising sauce was exquisite spooned over the spicy chicken meat.  The cute, little, pregnant one of us who claims she can't eat much anymore even ate two pieces of the chicken.  You've got to love Christopher, he boxed up all of the leftover pasta and chicken for us into individual boxes.Right when we thought the best was over he brings over a couple of slices of pumpkin cheesecake with walnut brittle.  I like cheesecake but it's usually something I wouldn't order because it's so heavy but not this one!  Light and creamy, like a baked pumpkin cheesecake chiffon.  The perfect sweet ending to a beautiful meal.Though I want everyone out there to go to Cafe Monarch because I think it's one of the best restaurants around, I don't think it's for everyone.  Of course you can tell him your allergies and aversions when you call to make reservations and allergies can't be helped of course and who doesn't have an aversion to something or other but meals like this are best when you leave it in the chef's hands.  Relinquish the control you think you need and let him decide what to prepare for you and I guarantee that you too will be slouched back in your chair rubbing your full belly and a contented sigh on your lips.I walked into Cafe Monarch and knew instantly how my dream kitchen would look, how my dream restaurant would be laid out and how my dream clientele would be. We had called in advance to see if Chris could prepare a vegan meal, a request he gladly obliged, and we were welcomed warmly in various ways: 1) A lovely greeting from Chris, excited to meet the vegan with additional questions about how food can be prepared, 2) prompt opening of our bottle of red to get us started, 3) a cozy seat by the fire outside while he prepared appetizers.The food was fresh and delicious, though I think he may have been timid and slightly insecure about not being able to cover anything on my plate with cheese. After an hour long post-dinner chat about vegan cooking secrets, he was (dare I say) excited about the idea of trying something completely new in the kitchen. So regardless of the food, which sounds odd because that's the main component of many of our reviews here, his contagiously friendly personality, openness and fervor for food were worth many more stars than this rating system will allow. Bravo and I can't wait to go again.Even though I didn't get a chance to eat here on my recent trip, Chris earned me as a fan when I stopped by. We'd just checked out of the Valley Ho and were heading to the Fairmont when I noticed the sign for Cafe Monarch. Having read all the great reviews, we pulled into the parking lot so I could jump out and make reservations for later in our stay.I instantly liked the look of the place: cute, cozy little house with some porch seating. But I was still taken aback when I walked in and realized the main room was seating and open kitchen combined--in a very small space. Chris, partially hidden behind kitchen racks, greeted me right away even though he was clearly busy. I explained that I wished to make reservations for a friend's birthday on Monday. He said they're closed Monday through Wednesday (the remainder of our time in town), as he plated some amazing-looking salmon on a bed of greens. I think I looked really sad (mostly because I just wanted to grab one of those plates of salmon and dig in), so he said he was really sorry but he hoped we'd come back when next in Scottsdale.You know I will, Chris. I'm just worried that it will be even harder to get a table next time! ;)Note: I also asked for a menu to take with me, but Chris explained that there's never a set menu since he changes it daily, depending on which fresh ingredients he can source.QUESTION: If you're in Arizona and can only do one thing, which do you choose:(a) Gaze upon the Grand Canyon.(b) Hike the trails of Sedona.(c) Tour Kartchner Caverns(d) Dine at Café MonarchBelieve it or not, the answer is (d) and here's why.  The hole in the ground, the red rocks and the bat-cave have all been around for thousands of years, and will continue to be around for many lifetimes. You can see them anytime and they're not going anywhere.  Now we are all traveling mortals, placed on this earth for a finite time.  You, me, and Chris (the chef at Café Monarch) are no exception.  Now I wish all of us, including Chris (the waiter at Café Monarch) a long and prosperous life.  But lets face it; none of us know what our Creator has in store for us, and that includes Chris (the host at Café Monarch).  Also, we never know when the landlord is going to sell our shop's location to turn it into a Wal-Mart, and this goes for the place leased by Chris (the busboy at Café Monarch).  Finally, we never know where we're going to be in a few years.  For example, we could fall in love with someone special and move back to New York City and this includes Chris (the dishwasher at Café Monarch).Let me put it to you another way... If Michelangelo painted the Sistine Chapel in disappearing ink, wouldn't you rush off to see it?  Some works of art or natural beauty will last forever.  But when food is art it must be experienced (i.e. eaten) hot off the grill and whenever you can get it.  So when the medium of the 'genius-artist' is food, you have to grab every opportunity to experience the masterpiece.  Chris brings a passion to his cooking.  He tells us that cooking became a necessity as a child, but it was also his chosen form of creative outlet.  He has developed an intuitive ability to combine flavors, spices and textures.  He provides beautiful presentations that are layered with tastes... you and your pals will be guessing at the ingredients.  This "artwork" is tasty, healthy and generously portioned.  All for about 40 bucks plus a $10 corking fee.  Arizona is lucky to have Chris feeding a few selected diners who are smart enough to make reservations.  Go see (and eat) this man's art.This is a must see, must do restaurant in Old Town Scottsdale.  If there was one restaurant I'd recommend in the entire Phoenix metro for a great meal/experience this would be at the top of the list.  Cafe Monarch is great and sure has found a niche that it thrives well in.  Very out of the ordinary with the owner holding the duties of chef/hostess/busser/and server, but he sure does it well. Having a very limited menu posted near the front door proudly tells what the chef wants to serve his patrons for that day. There's only two to three items listed with little description.  I was a little confused myself as I like to understand and take control of things, but I soon realized this was something to let the creator(the chef) to have his way with.   His creations come with enormous skill glorifying fresh ingredients into a dish that can appeal to anyone's palette.  I've enjoyed salads with salmon and chicken the times I have visited, but who knows what will be on the menu on my next visit.  Whatever it is, I will must certainly try it! Two final matters, bring cash as the owner doesn't like give up the 3-5% the credit card companies like to charge for convenience of the American consumer.  Lastly, you will have to wait until September to enjoy this place as it is closed for the summer.Cafe Monarch is everything the five star reviews make it out to be and more. It's a must try for a unique brunch/lunch/dinner/whatever experience in the valley! I'm reluctant to review this place since I don't want to wade through patrons on my way to another lovely Sunday brunch, but my taste buds will not be deterred. (Plus I have until September before they re-open, so there's plenty of buffer room.)It's an impromptu fly-by-the-seat-of-whatever-the-chef-feels-like-whipping-up type place. The kind of place where you show up to breakfast and are asked one question: Sweet or savory? So whatever you do, leave those picky eater at home! When it comes to dinner, you don't want a wonderbread palate ("Um, I don't eat anything green...") influencing the meal. Chef Christopher is a dynamo in the kitchen, and you need to leave that one man show plenty of room to create his masterpieces. No exaggeration, his dishes are crazy delicious masterpieces. It's like having your own personal top chef customizing something just for you.The fact that this place is BYOB makes my heart smile. I love sharing a couple bottles of good wine or champagne among friends over dinner, and the fact that I don't have to pay a restaurant mark-up is ideal. He's also cool with you brining in some orange or cranberry juice for  DIY mimosas in the morning. There's a $10 corking fee, but considering the fact that a glass of wine is often more expensive than that, it's a screaming deal. Be forewarned that this is a dining experience rather than a quicky meal. A much more European approach to lingering and enjoying the food, drink and atmosphere. It will take you a couple hours to get through everything from initial seat and greet with the chef (who doubles as the waiter/busser/todos!) to your last scrumptious bite. Totally worth every minute of waiting. Also, you might not want to come here starvin marvin. And definitely don't invite anyone you can't stomach hanging out with for a couple hours. Let's wrap it up:-Don't bring picky eaters.-Don't come so hungry that you'd eat the ass end carpaccio out of fresh roadkill.-Don't bring socially awkward schmoes that will suck all the fun out of the room because you've got to be around that for hours, man. Hours.-Do BYOB, and don't be afraid to bring a mixer for mimosa fun.-Do bring cash only, and tip very, very well. (He deserves it!)I now set you forth upon the world with the knowledge necessary to enjoy all that Cafe Monarch has to offer. Use it wisely.Welcome to another secret garden of Old Town Scottsdale. Are you wondering where Cafe Monarch is located? Well, it's hidden in the most delightful way and I wouldn't want it to be any other way. But if you really want to find it (and I don't know if I want to give the secret away), I will say that it's located just south of Indian School off of Goldwater. When a restaurant has a five star average and nearly 60 reviews, they've got to be doing something right. Cafe Monarch is no exception. After months of anticipation, Cafe Monarch finally reopened its doors after a summer hiatus and I couldn't wait to give it a try. Through yelp reviews, I heard that you come prepared to eat what the chef feels like making that day. Yelp friends, don't question the chef. He knows what he's doing. He knows what you want more than you yourself know what you want. I began my meal with a freshly made hibiscus iced tea. It was the perfect refreshment to enjoy the warm weather on the adorable patio surrounding the restaurant. Since this is BYOB, the chef mentioned that this iced tea is also quite tasty with some vodka in it, but since I had a long day ahead of me, I went the alchi-free route this time. Possibly dinner next time? The menu had a variety of items to choose from including a chicken pesto sandwich or salad and a prosciutto panini. I went for the chicken pesto sandwich after the chef said it was his favorite (and remember, don't question the chef's choices) and I couldn't have been more pleased. The chicken was roasted to perfection and moist with freshly made cheesy pesto giving it a hug. Situated on a freshly made french baguette, it was a treat to put in my mouth and I secretly didn't want the cuisine experience to end! To accompany the sandwich, the chef made a salad full of fresh cantaloupe, grapes and strawberries. I assume he makes salads based on the season and I was very happy the fruit season was upon us! The meal was perfect. It was light and satisfying in a perfectly peaceful setting. The house is adorable and I wish my own could resemble it. I think this could quite possibly be one of the perfect locations to dine on a lazy afternoon when I don't have a care in the world (or want to pretend that I don't). And before I go, I wanted to mention how nice the chef/owner is! He's very personable with his customers and makes each experience unique and delightful. I believe that delightful is absolutely the overall word to describe my experience at Cafe Monarch. Some things to note before you visit:- Cash only, so come prepared. I had an iced tea and sandwich with a salad and it was around $16. - BYOB and if you forget, there's a Circle K just next door to buy some "quality" booze - Be prepared to relax and enjoy yourself. For being a one man show, the chef/owner does an excellent job of preparing a delicacy in a short period of time, but the atmosphere is so adorable you should plan on staying to enjoy it while you're there.Shortly after I wrote my 3 star review, Christopher contacted me. He was very apologetic about our experience and wished that we had enjoyed our meal more.  He immediately offered to refund us the cost of the meal because we weren't 100% satisfied.After discussing his offer with my friends, we decided to take a 50% refund.  Let me just say that I was personally a little uncomfortable with this because while I have received refund/free meal offers from other businesses in the past, I've never taken them up on it.  I don't think it's about the money and I certainly don't write reviews to elicit free meals.  However, since the 3 of us split the cost of the meal evenly, I felt that it would only be fair if I took my friends' suggestions into account. Anyway, the refund check arrived in the mail yesterday.  I decided to upgrade my review to 4 stars given the overall experience.  It's rare to find business owners who value their customers as much as Christopher.Yes yes yes, for every reason all the 5 star reviews state below!  Multiple trips to wine country with more than my (small) wine fridge will hold, this is exactly the place I want to crack these bottles open and let the atmosphere and food wash over me.  Hey...though I love to cook at home, I admit my meals do not justify these bottles' price tags. :P  So bring your beautiful wine and enjoy the evening away...  actually bring 2-3 bottles and decide what you are going to pour once you hear the menu  ;)PS.  Just talking to Chris on the phone, he has more personality than some folks exhibit their entire lives!First off, I feel bad giving this place just three stars. After reading all the reviews, I was really hoping to like it a lot more than I did. I've heard for months from friends and fellow yelpers about how awesome this place is, so we decided to give it a try for early Vday dinner. The atmosphere is very very nice. Nice little cottage with a kitchen (where they have a few tables next to the chef), a dining area, and an outside patio area. There are lots of candles and can be romantic place. The waiters were all nice, but we had some issues with the service. A group of 4 that came 20mins later than us(just 2) sat next to our table and kept getting food quicker than us. The most annoying part was that the waiters kept telling us our food would come, but the speed and service was definitely lacking. As for the food, it was definitely worth 3+ stars except for the main chicken pesto dish. It was just two butterflied chicken pieces with pesto sauce, no vegetables, no special sauce, nothing special. I did love the appetizer 1 (white bean soup with side of bread with asiago cheese), appetizer 2 (barley and poached shrimp w/ sweet asian chili sauce), and one of the main dishes (pork tenderloin with a sweet chutney/hint of curry sauce and asparagus). The dessert was just some strawberries and fudge brownie. Again, nothing special.All in all, I did like the experience, but the food left me thinking there could have been more or that it could have been better. Maybe I went in thinking too highly of this place. I am willing to give it another try, but it's not #1 that I would recommend to a friend.** I wanted to add something. Chris, the owner of the restaurant sent me an apology via email and phone call. This says a lot considering chefs will get very offended if you talk remotely bad about their food/creations. I have to admit. I feel bad if I seem very cruel in my review, but I feel that I was not over-exaggerating anything. I like to think that I speak the truth and hopefully readers can appreciate that. One last thing.. Chris pointed out to me that the chicken pesto had provolone cheese and spinach. I am sorry Chris, I have a dull palate. Again, i would like to try cafe monarch again and will update on my next visit!My goodness! Where are these reviews coming from?? A PR company? I've seen such positive press on this restaurant that when my husband tried to make a reservation and they told him that we needed to wait 3 weeks and  bring two friends since they only had a four top I was still excited to go. Disappointed. One, you pay a cork fee for your wine but the waiters are nowhere to be found to pour it. Not ONCE. Two, the decor was sterile at best. It was like modern looking office depot desks placed in a warehouse in some parts and then fake pine needles and mirrors in another. Kind of 'off'. Maybe they need to consult a decorator. Three, although we were told to bring two people since there were no two tops, there were 2 of them just in our little room alone not even including the front area. FOOD: You had no choice of appetizers or desert. One choice.  For the entree you got to choose between fish and meat but when we ordered the meat they didn't even ask how we liked it cooked. It was all average. AND, the reviews all tout how involved the owner is in choosing the meals but we saw no hide or hair of him until we were in the parking lot ready to leave.  Small asides: I asked for black napkins. They had them but they were wet. Yup. Wet. And when we decided to take a doggy bag (yes, for the dog) they handed us a cardboard box and told us to have at it. DISAPPOINTED. We will never ever ever ever ever go back again. The food was OK but nothing to brag about. Considering they only have FOUR dishes in the whole restaurant I expected to be wowed. Not so.Don't waste an evening out or your hard earned cash on this place. And I mean cash literally. They don't take credit cards.I am surprised at all the 5 star reviews.  Café Monarch is mediocre for the expense.My boyfriend surprised me for my 40th birthday with a dinner at Café Monarch.  We were impressed with the restaurant concept, high end, delectable fare, operated as a one-man show.  The starter white bean soup was bland and the main meal was very, very spicy.  It took about 3 hours to get through only three courses; it was BYOB unfortunately the owner/chef charged us a corking fee. We were not able to choose what we wanted for dinner, we only noted any food allergies we may have had and the chef prepared surprise spicy beef dishes.When making the reservation, the owner/chef/waiter offered to make a special birthday treat and asked my boyfriend what my favorite dessert was.  He told him that I love cupcakes and Chef said he would make them for us.  At the end of our meal, he informed us that he had sold all of my cupcakes.  That was absolutely, positively, 100% unacceptable.I do understand why it took so long to prepare and serve the meals, but just that he sold out all of my birthday cupcakes, not even just saving one for the birthday girl, was disappointing.Unfortunately, I will not visit Café Monarch again.So, somehow, I had never heard of this place. I can't even recall how I stumbled onto it. Probably when Googling something like, "top places in Arizona that make you feel like you're dining in the movie 'The Secret Garden'". Or something like that.This place is spec.tac.u.lar (said like Kevin Spacey from American Beauty).My friend and I just kinda went on a whim on a Thursday night, not knowing what to expect. I didn't realize the menu was prix fixe, but the hostess quickly filled us in on the details - $45 for a 3-course meal. Salad, entree, and dessert. Fine by us. We were greeted by extremely friendly staff and a delightful little patio, lit up by soft lighting and actual candles. Not that fake fire plastic cheesy bullshit. We were seated by a little fountain at a small table with a chair on one end, and then a 2-person couch on the other. Clearly meant for some type of romantic snuggling. A few minutes later, the owner, Christian, came by to chat with us a bit about the history of the place. He was very friendly and sincere.Our server took our beverage orders and I said something along the lines of, "I dunno, gimme something fruity. No cucumbers". He brought back something perfect for both of us, and they were SKRONG drinks. I was already giggling like a schoolgirl. Luckily, the eggplant salad came out quickly after to soak up some of that alcohol. It was super unique; filled with diced tomatoes, olives, chunks of eggplant and a bunch of other tasty stuff neatly placed on a bed of greens. Oh, I should mention, their menu changes daily, so you get something unique every time you go. Not sure if it changes for lunch/brunch, but for dinner it does. The salad and dessert are the same, but you have 2 choices for entrees. It makes ordering very simple. My friend had the short ribs and I had the shrimp polenta. Our entrees followed quickly after the salad, both looking and tasting delightful. I honestly don't know what the Hell polenta is, but it was yummy. Everything was so fresh and simple, and being a bit of a cheap, uncultured person, I appreciate things that are simple. I had a bite of the short ribs as well - tender AF. Lastly, our desert came out. Simple as well. Just a lovely brownie with some ice cream and wait...HOD UP. Is this brownie toffee!?? Yes, it was a toffee brownie. I tried to be polite and take adorable girly bites, but fuck it. I ate that thing in like 5 seconds. Afterward, the chef himself stopped by to get our feedback on the food. He was a character. Funny, friendly guy who unfortunately told us he was moving back to San Diego in a month. But I'm sure whoever replaces him will be just as badass. I would expect nothing less at this point.So after 2 drinks and a 3-course meal, I'd say yeah. We were pretty satisfied. Our bill came to about $120 total. Not what we had intended on spending, but certainly worth every penny. This place is really great for a romantic evening, a special occasion, and definitely a wedding. I haven't been for brunch or lunch yet, they've been booked up the past couple of Sundays sadly. But I can't wait to try it and write a novel on how I feel about it for your reading pleasure.You're welcome.What a wonderful experience for me.  I had planned all winter to visit this resto.  My friend and I kept trying to set a date that would work in Mar/Apr this year.  With it being the high season here in AZ, we had to book about 4 weeks in advance to get a decent seating time on a weekend night.  So, we booked our date.  A week out, my friend has a family situation that came up and could not make it.  Well, I waited all that time (not including the time it finally took for us to settle on a date) I sure as hell wasn't going to cancel the dinner JUST because my friend could not go.  Ok, so this is definitely not the type of place one would expect to see a woman sitting along eating dinner.  NO WAY.  This place has the most romantic, quiet and beautiful patio dining room.  With it being April, the patio dining room was in full effect and in walks ... ME.. solo.  Dressed to the nines in my 5 inch heels and dress and etc as if I were meeting someone.. Nope... table for 1.I am seated right away and this is when I began to really sit back and enjoy myself.  Every person that came to my table called me by name, Ms D, can I get you some more Tea?  Ms D, how was the this and Ms D, can we get you a that?  Oh man, all that fuss over me made me feel like a true princess.  Chef Chris even came by twice and commented that he was happy I had decided to come anyway.  I was too.My meal was very good.  A week or so before the dinner, Chef Chris personally called me to ask what types of foods we didn't like and what we liked.  I said Chilean sea bass is my favorite fish and I generally enjoy fish.  I forgot to mention that the only thing I really HATE is fennel and caraway seeds - like PLEASE DO NOT PUT THAT IN MY DISHES.  How I manged to forget that important detail is beyond me!  So its the dinner night....   On my drive to dinner, I remember thinking to myself, how could I forget that i HATE fennel and caraway seeds.  I thought, what are the chances that he would have fennel or caraway seeds in the dish?  I shrugged it off and thought, "naaaah".  Get to dinner and discover they had Chilean Seabass (Yeaaa!) with, you guessed it, blanched fennel and etc.  My heart sank because I don't really eat beef, which was the other option.  so, I ordered the Chilean Sea Bass.  I figured I could possibly remove anything with fennel in it and just eat the fish.  To my surprise, the fish comes out and, you guessed it, I LOVED it.  Fennel and all.  I was shocked.  I ate EVERY bite of that fish.  Chef Chris told me that blanching fennel calms down the flavor and he was right.  It was actually extremely pleasant.  Any place that can make me like fennel and cause me to start cooking the fennel in my CSA basket at home deserves a minimum 4 stars.  They get a bonus star for the stellar service.I think I will return for a b'day dinner... alone in the next couple of weeks.  I'm due for some food pampering.  Bravo Chef Chris and staff!Wow!  Just wow!  Totally and utterly overrated.  I really wanted to believe the hype and hysteria.  I really did. My best friend and I went there last week.  The menu was melon soup with lime sorbet, heirloom tomato and cheese salad, and either ribeye or curried fish.  First the atmosphere is fantastic, really quaint and romantic. The servers were well meaning too.  First course: the amuse Bouche soup. It was about two table spoons of melon smoothie that anyone with a Vitamix can make.  Oh but it had a dollop of lime sorbet on top and a colorful swirl of who cares.  It was like getting dessert as appetizer but much less satisfying.Second course: the heirloom tomato and super sprout phenomenon salad.  It had three  one quarter inch thick half moon slices of tomatos, three pieces of cheese and three quarters of a pound of sprouts of some über micro green.  But to be fair it did have a shmear of some paste on the plate.  Basically tasteless, tomatoes were less than ripe and still very hard.   Really 55.00 for three slices of tomatoe, cheese and a handful of greens? Call me crazy but the value for a a foodie for food that tastes like my kindergartner made it is just not there.  Fail number two.  Third course entree:  I had the "ribeye" and my friend had the curried fish.  The ribeye was unlike any ribeye I've had.  It frankly wasn't ribeye.  It was three medallions of lean beef over black lentils and drizzled with who cares wine reduction.  Again very lacking on flavor, contrast, and flavor.  But seriously folks who doesn't love a bite of top round with a deliciously bland mouthful of lentils to deaden all your taste buds?  Oh and before I forget, after we ordered my friend noted to me they didn't ask how you wanted your steak cooked.  So the next time the server came 'round we asked why and said I want it rare.  The server (who I think is in training bc he seemed to have to ask the other server everything - which is fine better sad than sorry there's a sometimes steep learning curve in fine dining) said, "the steak is cooked medium rare the way the chef wants it."  Now I haven't worked with Gordon Ramsey but I bet you a million dollars that he'd ask the patron for his opinion on the matter.  That said I still really think he was in training and forgot to ask and didn't want to go back to the kitchen and get yelled at for not asking etc.  Been there myself.  Fine medium rare will do just fine - the chef said so.  My friend's curried fish (I totally forgot what type of fish but I think it was mahi mahi) was the best dish of the night.  But it too was not that impressive.   I think I would rather hit malees for fish in curry sauce.  And again it had some lentil bland mound under the fish.  The final course was dessert.  We ordered two Lagavulin 16s on the rocks (it took a minute because the server had to ask the lead server to talk to is about scotch options) to go with the...oh wait the dessert was so unmemorable I forgot what it was.  I literally can't remember what it was.  But I do remember being unimpressed and saying to my friend the first course soup would've been a better dessert.  Lastly the bill.  The night before we ate at Mastro's In Scottsdale and had  a much much better bill to food ratio.  And I am a ravenous foodie and I understand small courses and I Know it's not a steak house.  My point here is that at the most expensive steakhouse in Scottsdale where the ribeye is 70 dollars or so and you know you are being plundered for meat you could buy at AJs and grill or put in your salamander you are still getting tastier food and more bang for your buck.  Or likewise if you went to Binkleys in cave creek your money would be So much better spent.  Food doesn't get masked and duct taped with lentils there.  And you could do 3 or 5 or 7 courses or just order off the menu AND Chef Binkley will take the time to ask if there is any special accommodations for allergies, taste profiles etc that he needs to change or modify for you.  Oh and it tastes amazing so you get your money's worth.  At cafe monarch (where the chef is king) they must be doing summer budget cuts and dialing the food down a notch as the snow birds leave and the locals get the table scraps, or maybe it was an off night, or maybe they just serve food that way I don't know but frankly it sucked.  TOTALLY AND UTTERLY OVERRATED AND UNIMPRESSIVE!  Oh and the ice cubes for our scotch cost $2.00 each.  That's right two dollars for frozen water put into a rocks glass.  Seriously, the budget must be really out of balance.I had to come up with some place special for my wife's 30th birthday this week. Wanted it to be somewhere romantic with amazing food. Enter Cafe Monarch. Arrived for our reservation at 8:30. Taken straight back to our cozy little spot by the fountain on the patio. This place is beautiful. The lighting and ambiance in the back on the patio made me totally forget that merely hours earlier I was cursing at the sun and wondering if I would ever be able to hydrate again. The misters were on and it felt perfect (it hit 109 degrees today).Our waiter came out quickly and explained the menu and we ordered some wine. Smallish wine list but some great choices. Went for some Oregon pino.The meal started with amuse bouche of sweet pea soup with lobster, sweet corn and mint. This stuff was mouth watering. I could have had three more bowls....a solid start.Next was a summer salad of arugula, citrus, compressed cucumber, and tomatoes. Fresh and delicious.The only choice here, other than the drinks are to decide which entree you want. Tonight they had a choice between Hawaiian opah and flat iron steak. We ordered one of each. Both were amazing. The I fish had a wasabi flavored  purée side alone with a vegetable like hash ( I do it no justice ). So so,good. The steak was a perfect medium rare. My mouth is still watering just thinking about it.Desert was a light peach Napoleon. Light, sweet, and yummy.Yelp is rarely wrong. There is a good reason this place gets the best reviews. My wife was impressed, full, and snugly, just as planned. They even gave her a little birthday present.This was one of the best meals I have had in a long time. I have zero negative things to say. Bravo Cafe Monarch. Bravo.
Fu Lin Asian Cuisine=Two caveats: 1. I have little-to-no experience with Indo-Chinese and 2. Anywhere in Charlotte with more than 10 options for veggies gets an obligatory additional star.But. Seriously. Where have you been all my life, Manchurian Pakora? This dish has no Western equivalent. Frying shreds of veggies coated in chickpea flour to crisp dumpling-land, then drowning them in a savory, spicy gravy - smothered in bird's eye chilis - hot damn, that's heaven in a stainless steel wok. All the entrees are. Served in woks, that is, on small metal stands. Neat! So yeah, there's the blacked-out-window massage parlor, strip joint, and lingerie shop all within a stone's throw of Fu Lin, but hey, that's what I like to call East Charlotte Panache. It's ok. Rent, in this strip mall, is obviously low (Don Pedro's is a two second walk away from here, home of even frugaler, if not quite as delicious, eats). Means you can get a ton of tasty food for cheap - unless you're ordering a paneer dish, or something seafoody, most of your options are 9 bucks a pop. Soups are either 2 or 4 - the larger price is a huge bowl for two.The options for us veggies are endless. If it's not on the menu as vegetarian, and it's in any way possible to prepare it vegetarian, they'll make it for you. Guy was emphatic about the "made to order from scratch" concept. He also did an awesome job of explaining the differences in Manchurian rather than Chili preparations, how they spice things for various orders (ie, dried versus fresh chili), all that good stuff that you want to hear when you're an annoying, inquisitive, first-time partaker of any new cuisine. Lettuce wraps (on the menu why? Don't care, only place in CLT to get it with tofu) were just as I've had elsewhere, except no pine nuts. Still tasty. Nothing we ordered, meat or veg, failed to surpass expectations - but beware - medium spicy is not your typical medium. Had some crying peeps at the table by the end of the meal, including moi - but that's how I like it.I demand a recount!  Just like Annie W. I too ordered the wrong item. But you know what?  I still love this crazy restaurant and I can't wait to return and order correctly. Because even though I ordered battered fried chicken swimming in gravy, (should have ordered it dry, how was I supposed to know?)  I appreciated the heat and I loved the lentil soup that was served before my lunch and my lunch was only $6.50. Hells yeah. The man at the counter was really pleasant too.  Let's get a group and go order EVERYTHING! A UYE Indo Chinese with training wheel session. Please and thank you.
Rotisserie Romados=Some call chicken "the tuna of the turf." I don't, and I tend to avoid those people at social events. They have names for everything and it gets annoying. Where's the boy's room? "The Throne Zone" is upstairs. "The Piss Palace" is down the hall. Ugh, shut up.That said, I call Rotisserie Romados "the purveyor of the single greatest roasted chicken dinner I have ever had in my entire life, based on my level of hunger, state of sobriety and availability of Five Alive juice drink."From the millisecond we stepped through the front door, the unreal aroma of those no-longer-egg-laying, piri-slathered, fire-kissed birds and fresh baked bread had us throwing 'bows to skip the line. In our minds, anyway. Other Yelpers talk about the pastry counter that tempts the poultry patrons, but I cannot comment. I wanted - nay, NEEDED - chiggin.A mere 15 minutes and 18$ CAD later, we're presented with Styrofoam go-boxes overstuffed with tender white and dark meat, a mountain of crispy crinkle-cut fries and a surprisingly fresh salad of mixed greens tossed in a light (mustard?) vinaigrette. We sat, transfixed. I took a picture of chicken for the first time ever. We ate. My soul took a picture of chicken for the first time ever.Remember those people that name everything? They might also be the type to talk about fleeing the States in times of political strife. "Can you believe Congress?," they'll say, "That's it. I'm moving to Canada." Whatever. Rotisserie Romados, though? Totally worth revoking your US citizenship.Did I mention they have Five Alive in a can? The Québecois need to adopt me, stat. I'll do windows!When I think of Montreal, Portuguese cuisine is not the first thought that comes to my mind.  Smoked meat and poutine may be the dishes that Montreal may be best known for, but you can add Portuguese Roast Chicken to that list.  At Rotisserie Romados, their Portuguese Roast Chicken is right up there with some of the best grilled chicken that I have eaten.  How good was the chicken? This was by far the best meal of my trip!Located in The Plateau neighborhood, Rotisserie Romados is about an 8-10 minute walk from the Mont Royal Metro station.  Upon first glance, I honestly thought that the outside facade of the eatery reminded me of a church.  That being said, this "church of chicken" is a fairly small eatery with a few seats if you choose to eat in, but primarily a place to order take out.  Besides the roast chicken, Rotisserie Romados also has a bakery that serves up a pretty respectable selection of mouth watering Portuguese pastries.As far as the food is concerned, let's just say that something is seriously wrong with you if you leave here hungry.  Eager to feast on some chicken that I had heard so much about, I ordered the 1/2 Chicken Plate that came with a salad and was covered with a  mountain of fries.  At only $8 CAD, this was such a great deal especially with the portions being so generous.  Grilled over charcoal, the roast chicken was extremely moist on the inside, but still retained a crispy crunch on the outside.  Although the chicken was probably tasty enough as is, I decided to have my chicken slathered with a spicy Piri Piri Sauce to get the full Portuguese Chicken experience since I had come all the way from Hawaii.  The spices from the Piri Piri sauce and the drippings from the chicken were the perfect sauce to dip my fries in to scoop up all that yummy flavor.If this were not good enough, the lady at the register also added in a free dessert to my lunch.  This would be more than enough for most people, but I always have room for dessert.  I do not speak any French or Portuguese, but I made sure to remember the words "Pastel De Nata."  This Portuguese Custard Tart was the perfect end to my chicken feast and just blew my mind by how creamy delicious it was.       Just writing this review makes my mouth water and brings back fond memories of my trip to Montreal.The line moves quick and the chicken is delicious, perfect, moist, magique. The hot sauce is important. The pieces of meat are quickly cleavered for you as they are taken off the grill when you order so watchout for little bits of bone.  Order in advance to skip the big line and walk right up to the counter on the left hand side. Natas are one of my favourite foods ever so I always grab some of those as well. The staff are funny and at least trilingual, the Portuguese patter keeps the place running and I love seeing the patient smile when the old folks come in.My new favorite fastfood joint.I dropped by here with a friend that wanted some good poutine and decided to trust the yelp reviews.I was BLOWN AWAY. 9$ for that huge ass delicious poutine?! Dear god. That was the best chicken I have ever tasted in my life. It was cooked to perfection and the fries were also incredibly good. The gravy seemed spicy but not nearly enough to create discomfort. (to yelpers reading this, I normally can't take spicy.)My friend couldn't even finish her poutine and I was filled for the whole day (rare feat for a 215lbs 6'2 guys).ABSOLUTE.MUST.TRY. They don't have much selection food-wise though but the taste and price make it up by far. Incredible selection of Portuguese drinks and well-priced deserts as well.The only bad thing is that there is no place to sit.  The tables and chairs are practically all squeezed in and it is kind of uncomfortable especially if you're taller.GO HERE.Edit: Still freaking out at how good the damn chicken is. If I wouldn't be 400lbs by the end of the month, I'd eat here everyday. P.S. Everything else on the menu is also well worth it like the half-chicken.
Olive Garden Italian Restaurant=I'll be the first to give credit where credit is due: Olive Garden's recent rebranding efforts, with the new logo and font, and some more modern menu options, are welcome and give a nice facelift to the company.However, it may be too much change or not very well executed: menu now boasts a selection of "italian tapas" which are basically an extension of their appetizer menu, most of which are $5 or $6 and discounted to $4 during a happy hour special of sorts, offered Mon-Fri 3-6PM.Tried the polenta and shrimp dish- four shrimp atop a bed of polenta with a tomato and olive sauce, good value with four shrimp, but sauce was overly salty and unbalanced with many olives. Server apologetically revealed that the dish isn't going over well.Though they're most known for their pasta dishes (and, okay, breadsticks), I usually just come here for their unlimited soup and salad lunch special: $7 for as much of either as I like, along with breadsticks. Good value, and good flavors- I usually stick with the zuppa toscana, but the chicken and gnocchi is good for something different. In addition to the tapas portion, OG now has a small menu of featured dishes that are "healthy preparation"/lower-calorie than their typical pasta dishes. A few steps in the right direction, guys- now to work on the execution.Additional note: never get a cappuccino here. It's not worth the $4. Drive through a Starbucks afterward if you must. You'll thank me later.I primarily go to the Olive Garden for the bread sticks, soups, salads, wine and on occasion the never ending pasta bowl when they have it. Everything else they offer is okay and can be gotten in the frozen food aisle in the store with a better taste. The lines are extremely long when we go with a 30 to 45 minute wait and this is even worse when the temperature outside is over 90 degrees. The value for your money is okay, but could be a little better.
DD Peckers=Ohhh DD Peckers - the Wednesday night trivia SPOT.  The owner, Justin, is a riot.  This place has a dive feel with KILLER wings - just make sure you get them well done! NOM.  Everything is good though - fried pickes, salads, cheese fries, you name it.As for trivia night - every Wednesday at 8:30PM.  Get there a little early to get a seat and order some grub.Just an age warning - the trivia is raunchy and oh so fun.  Don't bring your kids.  Come to get your drink on, relax and have a good laugh with Justin on the mic.This place is a blast.  Definintely recommend checking it out!With a name like DD Peckers, you can be sure you'll offend someone. But it's not about the name. Really. Just pretend you didn't hear it.Finding the place can be a little bit of a chore, since it's not much to look at - either inside or out. And once you're inside, there isn't much room to move around, especially if there's a crowd. You also may not want to look too closely.The name is actually "DD Peckers Wing Shack" - means that you ought to try the wings. So go wild. There are something like thirty flavors on the menu, from naked (in keeping with the theme of the place) to the alluring Hoisin Honey. Try them all if you are so inclined, but it might set you back a bit, a 5 wing order costing more than $4.I'm old, but that's not cheap. At least you get the celery and dressing included, not like 10 cent wings at the bar when you have to pay extra.The big downside is the service - it can be pretty slow, so be prepared to wait. And wait. And then wait some more. If you think you might want extra wings, order them up front, because you may not get a chance for a second order.
Breakfast Joynt=Ok, so after a round of shopping with my mom, we were STARVING.  Back when I lived in Scottsdale, there used to be a deli in this place, but since I moved down to Tempe, I didnt know that this place had changed hands.  Its located right off Northsight, next to Golds Gym, and a salon.The place is warmly decorated.  wood decor, with warm red colors.  Very relaxing and refreshing to walk into.The menu here is somewhat simple.  Part breakfast, part lunch, with a few options to those who are hungry.  I got the omlette, with tomatos, cheese and onions.  When it the food came out, it was so tasty!!  My mom had the crepes, and said it was the best crepes she has had in some time.   Best breakfast that I have had in some time.  Plus, our server was wonderful!!!  I would love to eat here more often, as I think it was worth the gas and time.So far so good, as I would take my parents back here to eat, or friends, dates of whatnot.  Great clean place with great service.5 stars for the category! Breakfast Joynt, you had me at sausage gravy.  Lovingly made top quality ingredients sausage gravy.  Fluffy and righteous biscuits.  Done just right bacon...slightly crispy, not a second overdone.  Wholesome pancakes with just the right proportion of flavors of milk, flour, eggs.  Eggs!  Fluffy scrambled eggs again done just right!  Ham!  I will eat it at the Joynt. I will get right to the point!  It is carved off the bone I am eating some now hold the phone.But wait there's more!  Breaded pork cutlet sandwiches!  Thin, crispy on the outside moist and tender inside.  Turkey club sandwich piled high, fresh and delicious!  French fries perfectly cooked and lightly salted.  The topper?  Baked apple pancakes.  These are very close to apple pie.  There were people at my table actually grabbing the remaining pieces of this by the handful and scarfing (you know who you are).How did I try so many dishes?  Big table and an event with family-style servings.  Wonderful time.Even the brewed house coffee was first rate!I had very high expectations for The Breakfast Joynt because so many gave it 5 stars, which means "As good as it gets, Woohoo!" according to Yelp.  My experience didn't live up to that but I'm willing to give them another try.This location was formerly a bar that was transformed into a breakfast restaurant.  The actual bar is still there, with a flat panel TV in the middle, but surprisingly the shelves are still empty all the way up to the ceiling.  They've only been there around 6 months, so maybe this will change as they settle into the location.  It has a very clean, upscale feel to it - something not out of place in North Scottsdale.  It's also easy to find once you're off the 101 onto Raintree, and then north on Northsight... it's on the right and shares parking with Gold's Gym that is easily seen from the road.I found the eggs to be good, and recommend steering towards the omelet choices.  Being from the South, it wasn't thrilling that the biscuits were somewhat small and square shaped, almost like a little dinner roll.  They have their own style (and they've informed me that they are homemade) but I was looking for something more substantial to be smothered in sausage gravy.  The pancakes were not served hot with the other food items, and they seemed to have settled and were somewhat chewy and elastic.Menu was rather straightforward and clear with sectioned boxes, with a nice highlight of their featured stuffed apple pancake.  I thought the description of "ham that falls off the bone" was repeated far too many times.Prices were very reasonable for Scottsdale.  The fresh squeezed orange juice was excellent.  Owners are very concerned about customers with less than a stellar dining experience, so I'll be sure to give the Breakfast Joynt another try with friends and family.I would say 4 1/2 stars, but as you may know, I don't round up.Well, we finally made it back to The BJ (Breakfast Joynt)...right after the March Yelp event at the BJ as promised...well, pretty close to right after the March event at the BJ.Okay, it's pretty much 1  1/2 months later, and we hadn't been back "up north" at breakfast time. As those of you who have ever read (or "scanned") my "reviews" (or scribblings') have surmised, I could almost be classified as "recluse" in my Yelp Personality Profile (you all filled yours out, didn't you?). I just don't get out much!So it was with some trepidation that I emerged into the sunlight this past Sunday to run a few errands, get a workout, have a little breakfast and then have a little family time. Did I say breakfast? Why yes I did. After a workout that I can only describe as "heroic", we were back in the car and headed home. Once again, according to GPS, someplace in the northern reaches of Scottsdale was right on my way from the Camelback Corridor (or "CaCo") to my home in Old Town Scottsdale (what is finally going to work here...OSco...OTS...OTSco...OTowSco...I just don't know:).I have to get that GPS fixed...but it did take me to the BJ for breakfast. It was nice to get back!We got there and they were pretty busy, but we were seated within about 5 minutes of arriving. Our server was a little bit discombobulated...lot's going on and part of the shift had been sent home, and then they got slammed! But she was sweet and going a hundred miles an hour and since we weren't in any particular hurry, that was not a problem.I love breakfast...OK, I pretty much love all food, but I really love breakfast and the BJ doesn't disappoint (when has the BJ ever disappointed:).Let's get back to biscuits and gravy...is what I said to our server. I also had the fresh OJ...tasting like it was being squeezed into my glass directly from the orange:)...I had tasted both items at the Yelp event and they are still terrific! The BJ does a real nice job with sausage gravy (and as you know, there isn't any food that gravy can't improve:)The Beautiful Carin had an egg white vegetarian omelet that she really enjoyed, and we split a side of ham (ham is a vegetable, right?:). Even the coffee was really good! I'm not saying it's D'Lish or Pascucci good, but good, straight ahead breakfast shop coffee:)David, the owner came out and said "hi" and we said "hi", and...OK, enough verbatim conversation, but it was nice of him to say hello and tell us how much he appreciated the Yelp event and our returning on our own...nice guy!Since we were in the near reaches of the great northern desert known as NoSco, we had dessert (dessert after breakfast...nice concept:) across the border in the Republic of Sweet...The BJ and ice cream...it just doesn't get better than that:)The BJ is one of the best breakfast places in town and not nearly crowded enough...yet.So, get on up to the near far north and add gravy to your life...your cardiologist won't be happy, but you'll thank me:)8/07Brunch was a side of one biscuit and sausage gravy.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/5Ip4_yFvx3sz4qMqxl-4mw?select=YLS5RPPN-YOKdeQod58wHg#YLS5RPPN-YOKdeQod58wHg  Tasty!  Next time, I'll ask for the gravy on the side, so that I may try the biscuit without it being soggy.  Will I find Joynt's biscuits to be crispy and flaky on the outside?  Hmm...  I hope!Delightful service- quick, attentive, and friendly.  Clean restroom.Can't wait till my next visit to Mayo Clinic so that I may breakfast at the Joynt!  (One might say consuming one too many a plate of biscuits and gravy could hasten one's chances of a visit to the Mayo Clinic.)This restaurant seems to have a split personality.  When they are good, they are very, very good.  Friendly service and well-prepared breakfasts (the Eggs Benedict and the Breakfast Fried Chicken were two favorites).  However, after nearly half of the times I have visited, I asked myself why I keep coming back.  Perhaps, like some sort of dysfunctional relationship, I only want to think of the 'good times' and hope that the rest gets better?  The Eggs Benedict is a hit or miss - I never know if my dish will show up with cold, rock hard yolks and practically raw hash browns.  The Breakfast Fried Chicken (served with eggs as well as a choice of toast or pancakes) is a good choice, but recently, the portion size has decreased while the price was raised (yes, we noticed the smaller plate).  Service is consistently inconsistent - it can either be attentive, or nonexistent.Yes, the place gets busy, but that isn't an excuse for a 45+ minute wait for food (while being completely ignored, without even a water refill).  It also isn't an excuse to cram tables so close together that on one occasion we were placed directly in the path of the traffic to/from the kitchen, with trays continually being hoisted over our heads.  Being busy doesn't mean that you can set tables with filthy (dried food caked on) silverware and then be surprised when I ask for another place setting.I think it is time to accept that our relationship just doesn't work, and move on.For my 1100th review, I'm going to use it on The Breakfast Joynt.Groupon has brought me and the family into this place over 8 times over the past year.  We've come in for Breakfast & Lunch.  More recently, Lunch, to avoid the long lines during the Breakfast hours.  Here's a tip, if you show up after 12 pm you'll be better off than before then to find a table.  This tip applies to Sundays, which is the day we prefer to go.Here are some of the items I've had here:The Basic (2 Eggs, Bacon, Hash Browns, Buttermilk Pancakes) - $7.99Breakfast Burrito (Scrambled Eggs, Sausage, Onions, Green Peppers, Cheddar Cheese) - $6.99Western Burger (Cheddar Cheese, Bacon, Onion Rings, and BBQ sauce) - $10.99Sack of 10 Angus Sliders - $12.99http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/5Ip4_yFvx3sz4qMqxl-4mw?select=mVXqbkwPFs19EnACRXJANA#mVXqbkwPFs19EnACRXJANAMy favorite is the Sack of 10 Sliders.  They're very good and you can take a few home for later!  The staff is friendly, but sometimes the food order can take a while. I hope they continue to do Groupon, because the deal is totally worth it here.Return Factor - 100%
Feast Buffet=SIMPLY NOT THE BEST    Yesterday was about my third time catching the Feast Buffet at Texas Station's act. In Feast Buffet style the quality of the food could be good one visit and behind the eight ball on others. On yesterday's visit color me unimpressed with the quality of the food.  I arrived on the cue for Feast Buffet around 3:15 pm. It was a fairly long line that moved on the slow side because not all stations were available. The upside to the line management is that when I approached the front there was a register on both sides. If you've been to the Feast Buffet at Red Rock or Green Valley Ranch, you have to get off the line to pay then get back in line while being assertive about preventing people from the VIP lines cutting into your side. This line management technique raised my rating from 2 8/10 stars to 3. The thing is that the buffet wasn't really worth the wait.   The admission for a buffet adventure on Sunday is around $10.50 for all day brunch. In my honest opinion the brunch buffet is a gimmick to raise the price of lunch just like Red Rock adding some peeled shrimp to their Saturday buffet and calling it the shrimp and rib night to raise the price. Personally at 3:15 pm in the afternoon, I don't want an American food station for example to have zero corn niblets in place of scrambled eggs.  Both the selection and taste were bland. The Asian foods station was lacking on chow fun, spicy eggplant, and cabbage for example. The Italian food station was mostly spaghetti, meatballs, and filler food. And contrary to the majority of the Feast Buffets an ice cream station was nonexistent. The food was so forgettable. For example, the rib was mostly a sticky bone. The temperature of the coffee was below my expectations. My favorite part of the meal was the wonton soup. I did not have the usual experience that I have at the Sunset Station Buffet where the bowl of wonton soup is all broth and carrots.  What about the service? Just like the majority of Feast Buffets there is one overworked server balancing several tables worth of dishes. I did find it discusting looking at all the used plates at the vacated table to my left for a good half hour.   Feast Buffet at Texas Station is simply not the best. I know that they will never be the best. But they could be a lot better than they were today.
Le Club Chasse et Pêche=Le Club Chasse et Peche (literally, The Hunting and Fishing Club) is like a secret Speak Easy of yesteryear, with only a sign with their emblem and a street address, with no name announcing what lays inside the unassuming Tudor styled facade on the bottom floor of a multi-story building in old Montreal, not far from city hall. And like a Speak Easy club, inside lies a cave or cellar like chamber of rooms with low ceilings, brick construction, and dark paint covering the walls, with only highlight lighting resembling candles or torches in a medeival basement or monastery. In Le Club, discerning diners, foodies, business people and Quebecois dine alongside the corrupted politicians and Mafiosa that have made the tabloids a-chatter with pay-off scandals of recent news.The relaxed atmoshphere, paced professional service, and excuisitely delicious food make this a special dining destination in Montreal. We had a party of 9 for a business dinner after a long day of meetings. After a snail's paced start (I am not talking about L'escargot, but rather a slug's traveling speed) in which we were refilled water 3 times but not served bread or anything else until our wine was selected, things picked up very well into an enjoyable experience. After starting with a Pinot Noir from France in honor of our Pinot Noir gentleman wine maker from Oregon's famed Williamette Valley who graced our party, we finally had the limited menu handed out to us, and eventually read and explained to us, dish by dish by our servers.The menu for the day had perhaps half a dozen appetizers and about the same in main entrees. (See picture of menu for selections)Everyone thoroughly enjoyed their selected delicate combinations of flavors and eye appealling presentations of both the appetizers and entrees. The dessert and coffee was wonderful as well. The prices were not that unreasonable for the quality of the food, but expect to pay about $15 - $22 for appetizer plates and $35 plus et moins for most entrees, with special mains going up to $50. Parking is non-existent and on the streets of Montreal. There is a coat check room and a cute hostess to greet you. Waiter service was professional, but relaxed. The place doesn't have a stuffy bone in its body, so you can enjoy the good food without feeling like you are being graded on your dining etiquette.  We all enjoyed our meals and would certainly come back again for another chance to break bread for business or dine with our favorite somebodies.Disarming and unobtrusive serviceWhimsical, restful, tasteful decorMassive entree portions and small appetizersVegetarians bewareDuck with plums and foie gras... Super rich and good on a bed of quinoa and chopped nutsScallops appetizer seared to perfection and drizzled with a surprising candied lemon sauceVegetables with panache was a surprise, four vegetable sides on a plate, great bargain.
Viva Mexico=Although I was having fun traveling, and in love with Edinburgh, I couldn't shake the emptiness that I felt. It had been several weeks since I left the west coast of California and therefore just that much time since I had enjoyed a burrito...or even a taco.  I could feel the absence of Mexican food and it weighed upon me.Then, one evening, as I glanced out of the window from where we were staying, I noticed the "Viva Mexico" sign.  "Mexican food...in Scotland? Get the [insert expletive here] out!" I exclaimed. I was sure it was merely travel weariness playing tricks upon me. So, we went the next evening to check out what I was sure would prove a mirage.The "Viva Mexico" experience did not disappoint.  The price at first was shocking for thanks to geography, I'm accustomed to getting superb Mexican food at bargain-basement prices.  The food was was in retrospect, acceptable, but at the time the fact that it was Mexican food (extra star!) made it taste as if each dish were sprinkled with magic.  We ordered a tomato-based tortilla soup, quesadillas (they call them quesadas and in their defense, they were big), Sonora style-refried beans, and they special made some potato-chickpea flautas.  We topped these off with freshly made margaritas.  The dinner was expensive but the atmosphere was lively and the staff was both sweet and accommodating.  And, it instantly cured my culinary case of homesickness. TIP: If you go, sit in the back.  You'll get a glorious view overlooking Waverley bridge.
Pure Sushi South=I've been to Pure Sushi's Old Town location once for drinks and once for dinner... and I intend to return again as I had really good experiences both times.  The sushi is a tad expensive, but you get what you pay for - the quality is high!  Fresh and flavorful, I enjoyed pretty much everything I tried when i was there.  The highlights for me included:*cucumber sunomono*seaweed salad*edamame*box sushi - my favorite - a must order!*salmon sashimi - incredible!*yellowtail sashimiNice wine selection - we sampled several whites... and our service was attentive as well.  As for ambiance - the 'cell phone booth' by the bathroom is a nice touch, and I'd agree with the reviews that came before this one - it is hip, cool, clean, and located in Old Town... don't knock 'em for that.  Cool location next to AZ 88, the Mondrian, and Scottsdale Center for the Arts.The lunch specials look like they are priced well and the dinner main courses sound pretty amazing too.  Pure and simple - I can't wait to return soon!
Zaytoon Mediterranean Market and Kabob=The Skinny: craving Mediterranean food - this place totally satisfies from their decadent Mushi to the Koobideh Kabob. (4) service: the owners are super friendly and food is served promptly (5),overall - it's rare to find a joint where you want to return to explore the different dishes of a culture. Zaytoon is one of those places (4.5).I was craving hummus with some pita one day and the hubs found this place on Yelp. After that fateful night - we've been back at least 3x within the last week -- yes, it is that good.The key dishes here IMHO are the appys (priced at $3.99 each). Our by far favs are the masto khiar (yogurt and cucumber) and the masto musir (shallot with yogurt). The yogurt itself is so thick and luscious, I bet you could turn the bowl over and not a dollop would escape. Yes it is that decadent. Paired with endless piping hot sesame topped Iranian flatbread (FYI -the owners keep the bread coming) - oh so crispy, flaky - it is definitely addicting. We've tried both the hummus and the kashe bademjaan (roasted eggplant dip) too which are both very good as well. I've tried their falafel and veggie sandwiches with both optional sides of the shiraz salad and fries. The sandwiches are loaded with onions, tomatoes, green peppers and cucumbers with a ?yogurt sauce and is oh so delicious. The falafel is crispy on the outside while retaining its fluffy interior. Completely satisfying.The shiraz salad was nicely acidic to accompany the richness of the other items. Dressed with mint and citrus, the flavours of the onion, cucumber, tomato mixture really pop. The fries are okay and the portions are generous.My hubby loves to get their chicken soltani. Both the chicken and koobedeh kabobs are well seasoned and moist. The plate comes with a roasted tomato, onions served with a bed of basmati rice. The butter and sumac on the table are used to dress the rice. We tried their pistachio ice cream flavoured with rosewater and saffron. Nicely floral with some cardamom mixed it, it was a nice way to finish a meal and cleanse the palate.Every time we go there, I'm always looking around and try to see what other people are getting so we can try it next time. We saw another gentleman who ordered the koobideh kabob with fresh herbs and on fresh bread (aka KGB) which looked intriguing and has been put on our list to try the next time we are there. Not to mention there was an interesting stew they were offering over a different type of rice. The spinach soup and lamb shank sounded wonderful too.A key factor to why we keep coming back is the service. The owners of the restaurant are really obliging and willing to take the time to explain the different dishes they offer. I was a little bit curious about their torshi - it's some form of Persian pickled vegetables. The owner actually brought some out for me to try and warned me it was an acquired taste (it was actually very good - a little bit sweet, nicely spiced --- however the hubs didn't care for it). It's really cool that they would do that.Overall, this a great little neighbourhood joint that serves some delicious, intriguing eats for reasonable prices. Throw in the friendly service,  you have a hidden gem - not to be missed! 4.5 stars out of 5.After seeing the reviews from some good Yelp friends, I knew I had to stop and try Zaytoon.  My friends are right.  This place is great!I've only had Persian food once, in Los Angeles, so I'm still learning.  After studying the menu, I went with their KGB sandwich--Koobideh Kabob that's served on their fresh baked bread and served with some sliced onion, plenty of basil greens, a roasted tomato, and a grilled jalapeño.  The beef was excellent.  The juices soaked the bread that covered the entire plate.  I got an iced tea with my dinner.Service was excellent.  An older man waited on me originally and then was replaced by a younger man--the owner, I believe.  Iced tea was refilled twice with no need to ask for a refill.  The server checked back to make sure everything was OK.Since I'm such a babe in the woods with this cuisine, I asked the owner if there was a correct way to eat the food.  He said what I had done was exactly the way he does it.  Let the juices soak the bread and enjoy all the richness of the dish.I left without checking out the store section.  When I got home I saw Tony's photo of the ice cream and I wanted to kick myself.  However, with how good this meal was, I'll be a regular.  I have to try some different dishes and enjoy some dessert.I was so thrilled that I finally came in here to dine! I've driven past it many times and never thought to stop in until I read the great reviews on Yelp.It's a small grocery shop joined by the small dining area on the other side. The grocery side has some exotic offerings that you would have a tough time finding anywhere else. I've become addicted to the Mashti Malones pistachio. It's not your average pistachio.. it's bright yellow and you can taste cardamom, rose water, whole chewy pistachio bits! It's insane! I haven't purchase anything here but the ice cream, to be honest.. once I found it it was like tunnel vision.. However, the produce seems to be very reasonable and I could see myself coming here for vegetables now.So, the restaurant portion! They offer freshly made juices with some interesting combinations like carrot and rose water. I had a watermelon juice which was delightful and oh-so refreshing. On my first visit here, the service was sort of spotty. On the second visit, they were much much friendlier, and maybe this comes from them treating you more like a regular once they know you're not just a one time visit.The fresh warm lavash they serve here is dotted with sesame seeds and blistered just a little bit. They'll bring you an unending amount of this bread until you say Uncle!  It seems to be made to order, and is perfect for dipping in their bracing hummus, enlivened from the addition of lemon juice. I find most hummus seems to lean towards lemon, or tahini. Theirs is lemony. Oh, and endless lavash. The server was kind of enough to make many recommendations and answer any question without missing a beat. Did I mention endless lavash?So far here I've had their chicken kabob wrap with house salad. The chicken was cooked perfectly, and seasoned well. The fresh tomatoes in there just added to brightness of the wrap, and it was big enough that I took half of it home. The salad is a mix of tomatoes, cucumbers and onions that have been diced and tossed with some parsley, mint, lemon and olive oil.The koobideh is seasoned ground beef kabob, which is very traditional, and amazing! Very tender, perfectly seasoned, a lot of interesting flavors. All of the kabobs come with steamed rice and a charred tomato. Love me some charred tomato!Part market, part restaurant. But, it's all good. From the outside of this family owned shop you'll be unaware of the awesomeness that lies within. After several visits it's become my regular spot for Mediterranean food. Their two page menu is packed with tantalizing dishes. But after visiting here at least once a week for the past month I'm addicted to the koobideh kabob ($9.99) -- two skewers of ground beef marinated in a wonderful blend of spices. I've tried other items but keep going back to my first love -- the koobideh. The chicken kabobs ($9.99) are well seasoned and usually enough food for two meals. If you want to try both, get the chicken soltani ($12.99)  which has one skewer each of the chicken and koobideh. The filet in the Barg kabob ($16.99) was decent, but a little tough. For apps, the falafels ($3.99) and hummus ($3.99) are as good as you'll find anywhere in town.Mom and Pop operation with a Persian Grocery store adjacent to the restaurant. They have the best and juiciest Beef Koobideh in town. Their oven baked bread is a must with the Yogurt and Shallot side.They also serve fresh squeezed juices, which is a bonus. Polite service and casual environment makes for a very satisfying meal!
Flavors of Louisiana=It is so hard to find good southern food in this town. So far I have had the shrimp etoufee and and shrimp po'boys. There is nothing fancy about this place, however the food is amazing. Located in of course, a strip mall, next to LA Fitness. Somewhat hard to see, but definetly worth checking out. The prices are great too. Everything is under $10. Their menu has catfish, shrimp, chicken and a few other things. This is just a mom & pop little place which is awesome. I hope this place sticks around.Eureka! At last, we have found the cajun food we have been long-seeking -- homey, authentic, real deal stuff. Not fancy foo foo "takes" on cajun food. Not watered-down,  dumbed-down versions of cajun food. Just the good, real, stuff, lovingly, and painstakingly prepared with quality ingredients.Yes, the po' boys are good. The bread is spot-on, the ingredients cooked just right. Even the spicy tartar sauce (ya know, remoulade) is right. But po' boys aren't too much of a challlenge.The entrees will make you or break you. Since I've only been once (so far!) I've only had opportunity to try the crab landry - garlic bread, sauced with crab stew, and topped with a few fried shrimp.I could not stop tasting and analyzing that stew. It was full of layers of flavor - smoky, sweet, spicy, earthy, a slight hint of briny - all cooked down and blended into luscious deep brown brew of deliciousness!The dining room has all the atmosphere of a hospital cafeteria. Can we get some music maybe, at least? But I can easily deal with that, for the sake of the food.Wow. Even Lafayette, LA born Hubby was seriously impressed with Flavors of Louisiana. The restaurant was far from full on a Saturday night, but the customers came in steadily. It is a small place, but very clean, and rather sparsely decorated. At least you can taste right away where their priorities are. Hubby had the special of the night- three pieces of tender, perfectly cooked catfish smothered in crawfish etoufee. He had asked for, and was told that he would receive etoufee only, but got the special anyway. He loved it, but this mix-up is the reason for the 4 stars. Even though it was in a darker roux, which he normally does not prefer, he licked his plate clean. I got the shrimp po'boy which came in a large basket with fries. It was two 6" halves of a fresh baguette with lettuce, tomato, a zippy sauce, and plenty of perfectly cooked battered and fried shrimp. Our dining companions had an equally huge and tasty fried oyster po'boy, a side of fresh and tangy cole slaw, and a bowl of delicious seafood gumbo. Nothing was spicy, just super flavorful. The boys got the peach cobbler dessert, and even though we girls both said we didn't much care for peach cobbler, we certainly helped the boys polish off the big bowls when they got to the table. Even though FOL is quite a drive for us, we will be back very soon. Please note that as of October 1, 2009, they will be closing early on Saturday nights- 8:00 instead of 9:00 PM.We had originally attempted to come here a few months ago, but our friends decided it looked "too cheap, dirty, and gross."  Ugh... we swore that we would come back next time we were out in the neck of the woods and I am really glad we did!  The restaurant is located in an average looking strip mall and the interior is just as average.  That's fine by me though.  Like someone else said in their review, at least I can see where their priorities are.  I ordered the 2 meat combo with shrimp and crawfish tails.  It was served with my choice of side, and I went with the cole slaw.  I was surprised at how flavorful the cole slaw actually was.  The shrimp were big and their outsides were really crispy.  They were quite yummy.  There were tons of baby crawfish tails, battered and fried like the shrimp.  Those were also yummy and quite succulent.  I really really enjoyed my meal.If you come here, don't make the mistake that I did and not notice the yummy seasoning on the table.  I didn't notice it until after I was full, but I sampled it, and it was DELICIOUS!  I will definitely come back here next time I am in the area.We are always loking for places to eat that remind us of places we've lived or visited.  On this day it seemed like a good day for a Louisiana roast beef po-boy. We've been to Johnny's and to Pakway's several times in New Orleans and they both serve these amazing hot roast beef po-boys, dripping in sauce (mixture of beef au jus and mayo) topped lightly with a little lettuce, a few tomatoes and pickles all wrapped up in a very crunchy baguette role. So we Yelped po-boy places and Flavors of Louisiana popped up.  At first we had a hard time finding the Flavors of Louisiana.  Its set off the very busiy road in a small strip center, so look for their sign atop the building.  The Yelp directions will take you right to it. Well we were hopping to find a roast beef po-boy like we would get at Johnny's or Parkway's in New Orleans but... not here unfortunately.  What we did find was an amazing shrimp po-boy and some excellent fried catfish topped with crawfish étouffée.   Both were very good and very similar to what we would find in New Orleans.  We also had some gumbo, which was good but missing the roux was too thin and missing the andouille sausage but had plenty of shrimp and crab.  This is a great place to eat if you're craving some southern fried catfish or even a fried shrimp po-boy!  You won't be disappointed!I just can't.I can't write about the amazing po' boys. The glorious boudin. The succulent fried green tomatoes. I especially can't write about the to-die-for peach cobbler a la mode.I can't write about it because I can't eat it anymore. I'm a little verklempt, please give me a moment...Ahem. Okay, that's better.Try the gumbo if you want to live dangerously, it's spicy! And the crawfish boil is one of the tastiest things I've ever eaten, if also one of the messiest.Go and eat all of the things. When you do, please have a shrimp po' boy for me.I'll just be over here, hoping for a miracle drug that allows me to ingest gluten. If that dream ever becomes a reality, Flavors of Louisiana will definitely be my first stop.UPDATE: I received the following message from the owner:Hi Beth, Man do i have good news for you. We have a lot of Gluten free items on our menu!!! Yes i was a nurse for 25 years before opening my restaurant and Celiac disease was just becoming a known thing. So we can blacken any of our meats for you with our gluten free blackening seasoning. Also we fry in a mixture of corn meal and corn flour so no wheat flour goes in it. Just ask for your fried foods to be done in the cornmeal mixture instead of the flour. We have french fries, cajun chips, potato salad, cole slaw, dirty rice and red beans are all gluten free. Also if you come on Monday we have our Jambalaya and that is gluten free as well. So come on back and let us feed you some good and i mean real good gluten free food!!Jennifer GoffownerThis is a really nice family owned restaurant that is located on the far West side of town. It is definitely worth the drive. Good friend from Louisiana told me about this place and her food. So I got in my car and had to check them out right away.Inside is very casual with a vibe that reminds me a eating in one of those smaller towns down south. Decor is very simple with touches of the bayou and it's critters sprinkled here and there. The smell of the food instantly puts me right into the zone.Really love the Cajun Food and the Cool Cajun Zydeco music playing playing in the back ground. They have both a lunch menu and a larger dinner menu. You can order off the dinner menu at lunch if you are really hungry. The portions are bigger and there are more choices.So far we have tried the Dunkin Catfish, the Alligator and Crawfish Po-Boys and both of the Gumbos. How can you go wrong with Catfish placed on top of rice and then covered with Crawfish Etouffee. We also tried the fried Green Tomatoes on our last visit.The food is cooked and seasoned with tender loving care. Everything taste fresh and the prices are very affordable. You can always add some extra heat by choosing one of the hot sauces to kick things up a notch.Service is friendly and helpful. This is not a well polished chain restaurant with robots reading scripted dribble. Just great food with a fun and tasty menu.Use your GPS if you are coming from way across town. They are located in a large shopping center towards the back and the sign is a little hard to see from the street. PARTY IN MY MOUTH!4.5 STARSLouisiana meets ArizonaMy friends and I are always on the lookout for non-chain restaurants in the West Valley. After reading fellow "yelpers" reviews, we decided to give Flavors of Louisiana a shot and I am so glad we did. Flavors of Louisiana got it right. Fresh food, flavorful ingredients, large portions, modest prices, excellent cutomer service and  easy access parking out front.Flavors of Louisiana has a  laid back casual atmosphere.  As you walk in you see the front cashier where you order your food.  On the walls are some LSU teeshirts and logos , a bayou mural on another wall, and smiling and helpful staff. On our first visit we shared, catfish Po-Boy, hush puppies, shrimp, fresh bread, and Boudin Balls. Everything was perfectly breaded and fresh. We also had sides of the Red Beans and Rice (highly recommend) as well as cole slaw which was also very good. Flavors of Louisiana offers great food for the money! (each sandwhich & side are about $10 for the 6").If you ever in the area you should give flavors of Louisiana a try. You won't be disappointed.
Suite 701 Lounge Restaurant=before yelp canada arrived, i had to go to the streets to find the cool, local spots in quebec.  thanks to an awesome dood that held down a convenient store, he let me in on what he called the current hot-spot in montreal.made it to old montreal via cab in less than 6 dollars from le centre sheraton.  the lounge is actually connected to a beautiful hotel- notre dame.i went in and was impressed by the exquisite design aspects that reaked of pretentiousness, but this was deflated when i was serviced by the very down to earth barkeeps that were both very model-esque.after swigging on a generous pour of macallan, i asked of any jazz bars that were open...the monica belluci doppelganger asked if i made it to the terrace yet.  that is one thing you realize in quebec, all the hit-spots have a terrace.made it to the eighth floor from the elevator, confused...walked through a kitchen which brought me to one of the f*cking most incredible skyline views i have witnessed.the dj was kicking some 90's hip-hop- black sheep's blue cheese and from there the stage was set.  beautiful people, very international crowd (heard like six languages being spoken among groups), well-mixed drinks.  i ended up taking it all in, along with a few gin-tonics- which is one of the most ordered drinks in this town and then headed out to cruise old montreal a bit.
Habanero's Mexican Grill=Here is the story of how we fell in love with a little Mexican restaurant called Habanero's: Friday: Did a random yelp search for Mexican food in the Scottsdale area and stumbled upon some decent reviews for this place. Decided to try it out since it's not too far. After a slight detour we finally found a little unassuming store front in a generic looking shopping plaza with a red, white and green banner in front and knew that we must have finally found it. Ordered some flour tacos (fish, carne asada, shrimp, and carnitas) and a steak quesadilla along with a side of chips and salsa and our beloved Orange Bang drink that we were pleasantly surprised to find here. Within a few minutes of taking our first bites we turned to each other and proclaimed, "This shit is good!!" Fresh Mexican food that was reasonably priced and not overloaded with grease!! We were officially in lust. Saturday: Couldn't stop thinking about how good Habanero's was from the night before and made plans to stop by for breakfast the next morning and try some of their breakfast burritos. Sunday: Stopped by to grab a few breakfast burritos before our road tip to eat in the car. Bacon and steak burritos were delicious and not greasy at all, just like the rest of the menu. Egg, potatoes, meat and cheese in a fresh tortilla make these burritos worth coming back for again! And, breakfast served all day during the weekdays! Sweet! Monday: Craving Habanero's again and we even made plans to stop by on our way back into town. Unfortunately for us, they closed early for the holiday, but we were more determined than ever to get our fix in the next day! Nothing could keep these star crossed lovers apart! Tuesday: The craving was almost unbearable at this point. As soon as we got off of work we headed over to our new favorite place to pick up some tacos and another breakfast burrito. We were not disappointed, everything was just as amazing as the last few times we had visited. Habaneros can do no wrong! So there you have it...if you're in the north Scottsdale area and craving some fresh authentic Mexican food that won't break the bank then head over to Habanero's and you'll be falling in love in no time at all!5/31/13Finally stopped in for my first time visit to order takeout.  Since it was my first time, I wanted to check out the menu board overhead, but staring up at menu boards while people are waiting to take my order has never been my cup o' tea, so I looked around for a leaflet to peruse through, instead.  I liked the open layout of the grill and kitchen, as i was able to see the cooks in action.  I read under "Habanero Specialties" a listing for Chiles rellenos, a roasted poblano chile stuffed with jack cheese combo (rice, choice of beans-refried or black, choice of tortillas (corn, wheat, or flour) and pico de gallo for $9, and I'm a cheese-lover, so I had to try this. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/habaneros-mexican-grill-scottsdale?select=GtRJBN7OK6Vhu6x-zgZgrA#GtRJBN7OK6Vhu6x-zgZgrA  Looking around for a meaty meal, I saw under "Parrillada," that I could get a four-meat combo http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/habaneros-mexican-grill-scottsdale?select=GtRJBN7OK6Vhu6x-zgZgrA#vd5i45jyypKwClT1WigsnQ (grilled steak and chicken, chorizo, and carnitas, with rice, choice of beans, choice of tortilla, guacamole, and sour cream for one person, $11, but I also noticed that diners could add shrimp to their meals, so I wondered if the red meats were grilled alongside the shrimp (I'm allergic to shellfish), or perhaps there is a designated area where shrimp are partitioned away from the other meats, and looking past the order-taker's shoulder, I could see that shrimp are indeed cooked on the same grill with the meats.  I told the order-taker that I would like to try some of their barbecue, but I can't if the meats are cooked in the same area as the shrimp, since I have a shrimp allergy, and she fired off a few sentences in Spanish to the cook, who replied with a few sentences of his own, after which she turned to me and said that my meats would be prepared in a separate pan.  Sweet!!While my orders were cooking, I surveyed the place and observed that while the resto is small, it didn't FEEL small, because of all the flourishes that gave the place a bigger presence (wooden furnishings and counters, a mini-bar with a handful of Mexican beer pumps, a small fridge stocked with bottles of Mexican beer if you don't want to order drafts, a counter in front of the grills where you may dine, or sit and sip on a pint of beer while you wait for your takeout (which is what one guy did while I paid for my order and waited it out on one of the dining tables).  There's even patio seating, should you choose to dine alfresco, or if you don't want to leave the restaurant smelling like you spent all day cooking in the kitchen!Both dishes were muy delicioso!  Since I had two entrees, I decided to try both bean choices (refried and black), as well as two tortilla choices (wheat and flour), and they were all very good!  The black beans were soft and tender- I was expecting something like biting into boiled lima or kidney beans, but the black beans were softer, more akin to firm, spring peas (not mushy!).  I also appreciated that both bean choices weren't very salty and tasted freshly-prepared and sprinkled with cotija cheese, not from cans and doctored over the stove.  The chile relleno batter tasted decidedly eggy, which I did not mind, but if you don't like your foods eggy, then you might want to stay away from this dish.  I usually try to avoid tomatoes (inflammatory), but the pico de gallo smelled so bright and flavorful that I couldn't resist, and I'm glad I didn't, for it complemented the cheesy relleno perfectly!  As for the barbecue meats, I liked them all, even the spicy chorizo!  I'd say the grilled steak was my fave, followed by the diabolical chorizo, which also came with similarly-seasoned, grilled cubed potatoes.  (I didn't mind the spice level of the chorizo while the meal was fresh, but I noticed that it tasted too salty and too spicy for me to tolerate subsequent leftover meals- strange, that.)  While I enjoyed the grilled chicken (I try to avoid anything corn-based, since I'm allergic to corn, and yes, that would also include eggs... one or two in a batter is OK for me on most days), I wondered if I could order my next barbecue combo sans chicken and with more grilled steak, instead?  Doesn't hurt to ask...I returned the next night for another installment, since Mom finished the chile relleno leftovers soon after I arrived home with them.  Would love to go back and dine-in one of these days, and perhaps enjoy a complementing beverage and dessert with my meal!  :)  Mmm... happy hour menu sounds delightful, too!http://www.habaneros.mx/Happy_Hour.html
Daddy Duke's=It's been almost five months since my first visit, and I thought it's about time I gave Daddy Duke's a second chance.  I called in my order at around 2:15p of Penne Romagno ($9.95) for dine-in since I hadn't had anything to eat since 11p the night before.  I arrived at DD's around 2:25 only to find that the cook had waited until my arrival to start on the dish- I spotted him cutting up the peppers and prosciutto and adding them to the pan.  The pasta was delivered to my table about ten minutes later.  I decided to try their sweet potato fries ($4.50), extra crispy, without the pancake syrup it normally is served with.  I loved the penne dish!  Mind you, it didn't look as appetizing as it could have; I thought that the glistening prosciutto looked half-cooked.  One bite took care of that suspicion- it was delicious!  The feta cheese (some crumbled, some still sporting shape of the container it was shaped in) and roasted red peppers dressed the dish up a bit.  The SPF looked great, but wasn't as crispy as it looked, so in they went for a second frying.  Needless to say, they didn't look as delectable when they were brought back, but at least they were of the texture I was looking for.I also tried their two-pizza slice and soda lunch special ($5, add. topping $0.50 each), with ricotta and roasted red peppers.  I did ask if they used corn in their pizza and was told no.  Not even on the bottom to make the pizzas slide easier out of the oven.  I don't know how I forgot to ask if they served thin-crust since it is my preferred choice, but I did, and sure enough, the slices that were brought to my table were more doughy than I cared for.  I thought perhaps the wider edge fo the pizza crust would at least deliver the crispiness I was looking for, but the crunch factor disappeared, no exaggeration, within two minutes or less from time of arrival.  The ricotta looked fantastic, and while the red peppers looked OK, they weren't roasted.  The marinara sauce used was good.  DD's now serves Berto's gelato desserts (triangular wedges of differing flavors, including chocolate hazelnut, cappucino crunch, white princess, and spumoni)!  Cheesecake flavors come in plain, strawberry- or raspberry topped, and oreo.  A server told me they're trying to convince management/pastry chef into baking a peanut butter cheesecake.  Sounds like a great plan to me!Don't recall seeing a water fountain indoors during my first visit, but there certainly is one now.  The stuffed Easter bunnies adorning the feature (they've also invaded the women's restroom!) do not lend the restaurant a classy look, although I think it's a more casual atmosphere the owners are trying to achieve here.  Finding another way to advertise Sunday breakfasts and other specials, currently achieved by posting copy paper over the green window shutters and any wall space available, would do wonders for the ambience.  Seriously, the signs posted on the entrance door, on the register counter, and those propped on the dining tables are sufficient!
Eggspectation Dejeuner & Cafe=As if it wasn't obvious already, my favorite breakfast food is hash browns. Next on the list would be eggs, usually mixed together with my favorite shredded potatoes. If I can't have them together, I'll usually choose eggs on their own for how versatile they are. This is where Eggspectations comes in, a downtown Montreal brunch chain that specializes in all things eggs.In spite of it's cheesy name, my expectations were high for Eggspectations. Packed with locals and tourists alike, the place is considered large for the establishments around here, yet there is almost always a wait. Best find what looks worthy on the menu before being seated since service and food can test one's patience on any hungry day.The food hasn't disappointed so far. While I've had their breakfast eggs straight up (sunnyside up, over easy, scrambled) as noted in their regular platters, I'm much more a fan of their omelettes and eggs benedict, the latter of which has it's own section complete with all the benedict variety one could ask for. Favorites in that section include the florentine benedict (spinach, gruyere, hollandaise), breton benedict (crepes, ham, gruyere, hollandaise), and the boca raton (spinach, guacamole, gruyere, hollandaise). Most of the eggs are poached to perfection and the toppings make for a nice kick in the overall flavor, they just need more potatoes to soak up some of that yolk. Feel like going the traditional route? Try their regular platters and enjoy the egg-y names like the egg-chilada, (an ode to a Mexican eggs style i.e. huevos a la Mexicana), egg-stravaganza (french toast platter), oy-vegg (Jewish style breakfast), egg-CITEment (strawberry flambe + eggs), and many more creative naming schemes. What matters is the food is simple and certainly brunch fulfilling, even if there are few items under $10.In the end, this place is just a glorified Denny's with a special emphasis on eggs. It would've been fitting for it to be a Canadian chain but I learned recently it's also in Virginia and Maryland (huh?). Chains are one thing, breakfast is another, but breakfast chains will almost always get a thumbs up in my book. Eggspectations gets my vote for a solid option in good ol Montreal.Fabulous eggs benedict and waffles. The french toast was kind of mediocre but we came here two days in a row because of the friendly service and willing to adjust items due to food allergies. Both days I got the chicken eggs benedict the first day were the potatoes and the next day I paid a little extra for the garden salad which was pretty average. Husband got waffles first day which were excellent but the French Toast he got the second day was quite average. Tons of seating including outdoor I would love to come back
Cafe On Main=The Cafe on Main in Sharpsburg is often overlooked when Pittsburghers are pondering where to go for breakfast. I've always thought it was a shame that this place wasn't more popular as they serve a very good breakfast.  Their pancakes are flavorful and come with many options (blueberry, banana & chocolate hazelnut, choc chip & pecan, etc), their omelets are loaded with fixin's, they use a quality ciabatta bread for their breakfast sandwiches, their corned beef hash is outstanding, etc.  The only breakfast item that I would ding are their sausage links.  They look, taste, and have the texture of pre-made, pre-cooked, links that have been microwaved. In fact the sausage links seem like what you'd get at McDonalds. So, you're probably wondering why did I give them just 2 stars?  Well, I brought my brother, sister-in-law, & nephews in from out east and my mom & Dad in from the North Hills to enjoy a Father's Day brunch at the Cafe on Main.  My Dad arrived early and took a seat in their waiting area.  Dad gave an older "gentleman" who appeared to be running things (the owner?) his name and the size of our group and was curtly told "we don't seat you until everyone is here." My Dad clearly wasn't asking to be seated in the dining room yet - he had settled in on a chair in the waiting area. A few minutes later my Dad asked this "gentleman" if he could have a cup of coffee. The response? "I'm waiting on customers."  So I suppose an elderly man who has told you that a group of 7 will be eating at your establishment on Father's Day isn't a "customer"?   Our full group arrived and after waiting about 15 more minutes (Dad had patiently waited, with no beverage, over 45 min) , we were seated.   Our waitress was nice and helpful.  She would disappear for long stretches but we knew it was a busy day for them so we didn't get frustrated.  As various people finished eating she was quite prompt with clearing the table, which we appreciated. As our meal was winding down, I paid the check so that would be taken care of and we could leave as soon as everyone finished eating.  Given that it was a holiday and I could see how hard she was working while keeping a smile on her face, I left a 30% tip. So, it seems we have a delightful Dad's Day, right?  Well, almost.  Despite the fact that two people in our group were still eating, the "gentleman" who was running the show came over to our table and quite rudely told us that "people were waiting" and we needed to "move on out."  His tone was abrasive and there was not even a hint of courtesy.  Please keep in mind that we had waited to be seated too, once we were seated the waitress did quickly ask for our order but when we asked for a "few more minutes" we ended up waiting almost 15 to get her back to the table. The food was also slow to come out.  What I'm saying is that we weren't dilly-dallying and holding up progress. We were at the table a good 30 minutes with no food.  We had been at the table about 1 hr and 15 min when the "gentleman" essentially kicked us out. About 40% of that time was waiting on his restaurant to serve us. Two of us were still eating when he asked us to leave!   I understand that small restaurants need a turnover but there's a polite way to encourage your guests to finish up and there's this "gentleman's" way.  Both my brother and father, the two we were celebrating today, were disgusted by this "gentleman's" behavior and told me that they would never come back here.  A lovely meal ruined by a crabby ol' man with a sharp tounge.
zpizza=So I had read good reviews on the other sites and one of my coworkers at another branch had indicated Z Pizza was good eats. When the location at Monroe and 1st Ave opened, I was very excited since it's just across the corner from my office. There are a few pizzas ready for by-the-slice options--all have proven to be very good. My boss ordered a salad and she liked it; however, as a rule of thumb I don't order salads as a meal. Overall, I really like the pizza, the setting is clean and appears to be efficiently laid out, and being so close to my work could get me in trouble (but that's totally my fault). With the weather cooling off, I'm sure their patio will see increased traffic.There are signs indicating beer and wine are on their way so that will be a plus.We're ordering from here today as an office meal, so I'll be updating with this experience.If you're in the downtown area, check out Z Pizza.O M G!! So today our main guy called in sick so we had to bring in another person who could fulfill his duties. It sounds impressive, but it's just a really cool title. So, anyway, this other guy, Patrick, decided to buy us all lunch on his corporate card. While I'm not one to take advantage of the company's hospitality, I was more than willing to forgo the Curry Chicken Sandwich I've had the past two time (flippin'' out of this world for a sandwich, with the bread slightly on the dry side but no soggies is a good thing) and opt for the calzone. Please, someone kick me in the nuts! Even though I had to wait an hour for my allotted lunch time and the calzone wasn't at its optimal temperature, I swear I leaked just a little during my first three bites. Oddly enough, I opted for the veggie version of this Italian classic which surprised one of my coworkers significantly--she thinks she's converting me to the meatless way of life but have I a different story to tell. Sun-dried tomatoes and artichokes melded with my roasted garlic sauce and mozzarella and ricotta cheese [in all fairness, I think the ricotta was added in error but I'm not complaining!]. While I'd normally take 45 minutes to finish any meal at work, this sucker was gone in under 15 minutes. :sigh: I almost needed a cigarette after that experience. Thank you, z-pizza, for allowing me to experience at work what only the bravest of souls have already--an orgasm.I have to give this pizza joint some credit. I've been coming to this place a lot, so it's time to give them my yelp review. This place is within walking distance from my apartment and I usually get their salads. Not the usual salads that you get from other pizza places. Salads here are different and a lot more creative. I usually get the Arugula and the Pear Gorgonzola which are both equally tasty, healthy and delicious. I also love that they have gluten-free crust and vegan ingredients. My niece can't have wheat, so having this option is important. I'm glad more and more places like this are serving gluten free foods. The slices of pizzas that have been sitting there are not that good though. Go build your own and have it freshly made. The Vegan pizza with gluten free crust is quite tasty and delectable. Prices are reasonable, establishment is clean and the staff is pretty nice. Overall, I have to give them 5 stars for having great prices for tasty slices, edible salads and the reasons I mentioned above!Heeeey, Z, Baaaaby, you know I didn't mean those things I said before.  I was exaggerating.  You know how I exaggerate.What had happened was......I wasn't feeling too good that day and took my foodie frustration out on you.  Baby, your service is on point.  That arugula salad was crisp and delicious with the candy coated walnuts.  The caaaandy cooooated waaaalnuts.  Caaaandy cooooated waaaalnuts.  I think you gave me extra didn't you?   Ummm hummmm.And the pizza was just how I like it.  You knoooow how I like my pie don't you?  Don't you?  Don't youuuuu?Puleeez take me back.  Z, I love you.
Villa Francesca=Last week, I drove by Villa Francesca, I said out loud, " I want that restaurant to have great pizza by the slice."  I tried it tonight and it was outstanding.  A fresh pizza came out of the oven and I ordered a slice.  I sat outside on a bench and ate my pizza. It was a little thicker than "thin" crust, topped with crushed tomatoes, fresh basil and mozzarella.    The owner came out and introduced himself and offered me another slice!!  It's good to be a girl!I don't think I want to eat pizza anywhere else in CLT.  My slice was $3.  The menu dinner items were $10-$15.  I can't wait to go back.  They are open on Sunday and outside seating.I almost didn't want to write this review and give Villa Francesca only 3 stars. I say this because our server was sweet and efficient, it's a very convenient location Uptown (not too bad to park) and I'm always on the prowl for tasty Italian. I'm clamoring to get back and try the 'za and I imagine that will likely take it up to the next level. I suppose that's what review updates are for!Inside, Villa Francesca is a roomy Italian resto with tables a plenty and booths large enough for the whole famiglia. This isn't super fancy pants Italian, and I kinda like it that way. The menu has all the classics: the parms, the pizzas, the pastas, the salads, etc. No doubt even the pickiest of eaters will find something to satisfy their hungry. I also imagine that this place is pretty good for kiddos as the portions are pretty generous and every kid I've ever known loves pizza.Anywho, I was in quite the mood for stuffed shells this particular day, so that's what I went for. The shells were good - a generous portion of four jumbo stuffed shells baked with a bit of cheese and covered in pomodoro sauce. While I enjoyed half and took the remaining home for a next day lunch, I kept comparing them to other stuffed shells I've had in Charlotte. The flavor of these was nice, albeit a bit salty, the shells were cooked well (a bit al dente) but it was the filling that I wasn't blown away by. The ricotta mix tasted a bit gritty...not creamy and insanely delicious like I'm used to. I know I'll be back to try some other items and I think I'll be much happier with the end result. The pizza looked huge and delicious, I'll need to hit that up. So, for now Villa Francesca, see ya later & ciao.
Yard House=120 beers on the tap, 120 beers, take one down, gulp it down, 119 beers on the tap...you get the idea. The Yard House IS beer. But they also have 24 appetizers. 14 different starter salads and soups. Oodles and scads of burgers and sandwiches. Endless lists of steak and house specialty entrees. It makes The Cheesecake Factory menu look like a freakin' pamphlet. We arrived with a group of nine and were greated and seated by a friendly host staff. We opted for a table over a booth, cuz I ain't gonna be the bastard squished in the middle, drinking beer and having to get out 3 or 4 times to pee. We had just come from the Shamrock Foods show at the U of P stadium and had grazed on all things fried and anything you can stick a party toothpick in. So I was ready for a black and tan and perhaps a salad. Black and tan, both of them, went down quickly. I ordered the turkey cobb salad. And I got exactly that. Turkey was a tad dry, of course, when isn't it, and at $13.45, kinda pricey. Others had the mac n cheese, which was overwhelmed by the mushrooms. A BBQ chicken salad, that was, described as "Meh" (and no I was not with Pierre)...apparently though "Meh" is catching on like my current year motto "Make it great in 08"...well at least mine rhymes. Best dish on the table, not at the table, cuz that woulda been moi, but best dish on the table was a Korean rib appetizer. Server Christa was fantastic although frustrated as the runners delivered our meals and "auctioned" them off even though she had ordered them by position number. Music was all things 70s and 80s...The Outfield! What the hell happened to them?Located in Glendale this House is not in my back yard and that's OK with me.WHAT? I can't hear you!Grace? Died 30 years ago!Good luck conversing.I don't review many chains, but I am going to take a stab on this one.  Been meaning to check out a Yard House ever since Josh A's glowing endorsement on the Talk boards awhile back.  102 tap beers sounded right up my alley.  Didn't think I had ever been to one before, but it was pointed out to me that I was at one in San Diego in the Gaslamp Quarter a couple years ago.  Remember really having liked it.  Probably would have gone 4 or 5.  Low 3 on today's visit.The music was blaring loud this evening.  I'm sorry, but Matchbox 20 was not meant to be played that loud.  They are not even that good as background music.  I thought the waitress was going to kiss my mother on the lips as she was leaning in so close to hear the order.  Do they really think people like the music that loud?  Most of the customers were either parents with kids or gray-haired snowbirds.  No one was rocking out to it. Had two Uinta Hop Notch's which I have never seen anywhere else before.  Quite tasty.  The menu is very extensive both on beer and food.  Got the Mediterranean flatbread as an appetizer.  It was not good.  No sauce whatsoever, just toppings on crust.  Would have also been much better if the tomatoes were sun dried.  Would not get it again.The blackened swordfish tacos were pretty good.  Little light on the fish, but excellent flavor with a healthy dose of guacamole.  I would definitely get these again.  Also had a couple bites of the Vodka Shrimp Pasta.  Think I will get that the next time I go when they open at West End in St. Louis Park.  Hopefully, they will use the volume dial on the music more prudently.Whether in SoCal or Arizona, The Yard house  is never a let down! Plenty of beers on tap, including local AZ beers. Lots of people and good appetizers. After a few letdowns in the area with bars, this was the most fun of them all that night! Definitely will be back when I'm in the area.
Mezzo Bistro and Wine=This was a pleasant new find for me.  Armed with a Groupon, and accompanied by another couple, I knew nothing about this bistro except that it served Italian food.  So, I gave it a full gustatory workout to see what it might bring to the table.We opened with very good fresh Italian bread and Fried Calamari with peperoncini added.  This appetizer came with a mild Marinara Sauce, and my request for Lemon Aioli as an additional dipping choice was graciously accommodated without charge.  As for the Calamari itself, the rings were very good, somewhat better tasting than the tentacles.  Requested butter was quickly provided for the bread.   Italian Wedding Soup was very odd.  It contained spinach leaves as expected, but also cut carrots and a lot of white chicken meat.  I had to send it back, because it wasn't very hot and contained no meatballs as Italian Wedding Soup should.  The restaurant manager and co-owner who was making the rounds of tables agreed; normally included meatballs were missing from my bowl.  When it returned, the small meatballs were the best part, but I didn't like the included tiny tubular pasta noodles that much.The rest of the dinner soared.  A dinner-size classic Caesar Salad contained firm green leaves of Romaine Lettuce, crunchy croutons, and a good creamy Caesar Dressing.  The portion was generous and took awhile to finish.  The huge portion of Eggplant Parmesan that immediately followed was cheesy, saucy, and quite delicious--magnificent, and the best of its kind I have ever eaten.  My fellow diners were also pleased with their food.  A brick of Meat Lasagna and Veal Alfredo looked particularly appealing.There was no room or time for any dessert.  We had to dash off to the Cannery to arrive in time to see the last scheduled performance of "Red Tails" on its opening night.  I will sample Mezzo Italian Bistro's several dessert offerings on another day.Seating was comfortable in the cozy bistro, our servers were friendly, and service was good.  Dinner and the movie that followed constituted a fine night out!  A reprise will soon be in order.Armed with a Groupon, we headed to Mezzo - to a neighborhood we've never been to - to celebrate our anniversary.  I was impressed with the decor: trendy, but not too, nice bar (except for the ubiquitous TV, but only one), nice lighting, tablecloths covered with paper in true bistro style.We had truly great service; the music ( Frank, Dean, Tony - apparently a legal requirement at all Italian restaurants in Vegas -  with some newer stuff for variety) was a bit too loud, so it was turned down immediately at my request.  I was a bit chilly, so the heat was instantly raised.  Our drink orders were taken right away, and the food orders when we were ready.We shared a dinner salad, consisting of the usual suspects, with the addition of chickpeas and a dollop of ricotta for interest.  It would have been appreciated if the kitchen had separated it for us before it was served.  For entrees, my husband ordered his new favorite - chicken piccata - and was pleased with it.  I decided to go with the Tuscan Tenderloin, pork cooked in Chianti, served with apples in Prosecco, and asparagus.  The apples and asparagus were fabulous, as was the sauce for the pork, but the texture of the meat wasn't blowing me away.  I would have kept it, but when the waiter asked how our food was, I must have made a little face.  What happened next is the hallmark of a very good restaurant:  the owner came out, took the pork away and checked it in the kitchen where the light was better.  Long story short, he told me that I still wouldn't be happy with it if I had him make me a new one, and that I should choose something else.  Hubby's chicken looked very good, so I went with that.  But I kept the penne that had come with my pork, because it was perfectly al dente and sauced just right, so I had them hold the angel hair.  But I got my asparagus back, and it was sooo good!  The chicken had fresh capers, which really bump up chicken piccata several notches, and this one was a winner.We never order dessert, but since we were celebrating a whole decade of marital bliss, we decided to break the rules.  (And this after pigging out on the 30-day cruise we'd just come back from!)  Hubby wanted the cannoli, but I've never been a fan of them, so I convinced him to go with the cheesecake.  But the wonderful owner, Sean, brought him a sample of their cannoli, and man, if they all tasted like that one, I'd be eating them for breakfast:  big chocolate chips, chocolate sauce, so decadent my mouth is watering just writing this.  Ah, but the cheesecake was fabulous, too, a small round individual cake covered with fresh strawberries.  Rich and delicious, and all mine!  I could have scarfed down the whole thing, but my superego kicked in, and I managed to have it last for three nights. It's wonderful when a restaurant owner cares enough to make sure that you're satisfied with all aspects of the restaurant experience, even if you're there with a Groupon, and that makes all the difference.  It was great to leave with that feel-good feeling that makes you want to go back.Buckle up, Mezzo Bistro.  Here it comes.  I'd give you a ZERO rating, but since that isn't possible, you'll earn a completely undeserved one star.  10/30/2013, about 11:30 a.m.My wife and I go in for lunch, order a Caesar salad and two entrees.  The salad comes out, and to be honest, it's pretty good.  Then, my wife finds a PUSHPIN in her salad.  Are you f**king kidding me?  A PUSHPIN?  She spits it out (lucky - for you - that she wasn't injured), and I call the only staff member I can find over. (A blonde woman working behind the bar.)  We show this to her, and she quickly apologizes and goes back into the kitchen.  For a while.  My wife, visibly shaken, isn't really comforted by the half-hearted apology and disappearing act.  The woman eventually came back out and went straight behind the bar, obviously having no intention of speaking to us again.  No manager or chef came out to check on us either.  So we left.  BTW:  Y'all can keep the groupon voucher we handed her at the beginning of the meal - it's a pretty safe bet we're never eating there again.I don't know how the hell you have your kitchen and prep areas set up, but how the hell do you prep food anywhere near pushpins?  You didn't see any possibility that this could eventually cause a problem?  No?  I will say that this wasn't our first time there.  In fact, it was probably our 6th or 7th time in.  And all the other times, I left happy with my meals.  But never again.  I don't care how many good meals you serve, one "I-could-have-been-seriously-injured-by-your-carelessness and ineptitude" is all it takes.  I realize there's probably not much you can do to satisfy a customer that was one swallow away from spending the rest of the day in the ER because of your stupidity, but here's a tip:  DON'T RUN AWAY AND HIDE FROM THEM EITHER.  Way to run a business, guys. So go ahead and try your luck at Mezzo Bistro, people.  It is Vegas, after all, so if you feel like gambling with your life, knock yourself out.Another one that is beyond me on how it's rated so poorly. Quality fresh pasta, seafood, wine, good beers, pretty and clean restaurant with good service - yet people feel the need to rate it poorly? I wonder where they eat...A lot of people that seem to complain have coupons - not that I have anything against coupons, but they also complain about the prices. I cannot say this enough - you will pay higher prices for higher quality of food. Just because it's pricey, don't complain. You have other cheap options with more affordable prices. Don't walk into somewhere complaining about prices when you had the option to walk in. I will tell you this - the Penne with vodka sauce...probably the best I've had in town. It was perfect. The pasta was perfectly cooked and soft. The sauce was amazing. It was creamy, cheesy and you taste the vodka in it. Everything and more you could ask for in this dish. It tickled my fancy.We also had the meat lasagna. The marinara sauce with the cheese - positively delightful. Appetizer, we had calamari. It was served with peperoncini's and cooked perfectly. There homemade marinara sauce really is very good. Nice thick chunks of tomatoes and a really good strong basil flavor.The service was good and the server was super friendly and attentive.My problem with this place is the location. I don't think it'll reach it's full potential because it's hidden. Also, the crowd that would be more attracted to this place may be more in the Centennial area. I hope it does succeed though. I love to see anything that isn't a chain do very well and make it to where the other chains can't compete.Sorry to say that the one star belongs to Marisa, the most professional server, at Mezzo.  My family has enjoyed Mezzo in the past, several times. However, recently, on Veteran's Day, we were humiliated and disheartened.  We sat down to enjoy a dinner, with our Groupon, on Veteran's Day.  We were met by a most unprofessional wait staffer. She was abrupt and crudely remarked, in a heightened tone, that the Groupon was not accepted on Veteran's Day! What?  We read the Groupon aloud, indicating that there was no mention of Veteran's Day exclusion on the Groupon. Here, my husband, a Viet Nam Vet sits, with his Marine Corps shirt, and listens to the waitress coldly repeat-"No not accepted today!!"  I asked her to call for a manager, she never did, she just went to the back and retuned in two minutes and said that the Groupon is not accepted today.  I was ready to leave. Then she remarked, " It's up to the owner's discretion,  he said NO.  At the risk of having a problem and ruining the day, we ate and left.  We called Groupon Corporate immediately.  Groupon noted that Mezzo was wrong and the Groupon was supposed to be honored.I went back to Mezzos today, with my Groupon, and spoke to a manager and  one of the owners- Kelly Richards. After explaining my experience on Veteran's Day and having eaten dinner, they were both extremely arrogant.  They apologized for the servers behavior (chalking it up to a bad day), they repeated that it is up to the owner's discretion to use the Groupon and they DIDN'T ACCEPT GROUPONS ON VETERANS DAY!    Their nerve and arrogance is beyond words. He didn't even realize the level of his indifference and callousness.  He kept boasting about what he does for the community.  Well we have news for him, you show us no respect and dignity, and you will receive the same treatment in return.  How dare you be so rude to a veteran on Veterans Day, or at anytime!!  I hope all the vets that patronize your "mom and pop" business, get this message.  I will be sure to get this message out.  WE WILL NOT RETURN.  All vets should stand together and be aware of this treatment.Mezzo BistroThe Good, the Bad, and the Office SuppliesIt pains me to write this because I really liked this place, but Yelp is all about honest and useful reviews, right? Brace yourself.In the past two years have I visited Mezzo Bistro about five or six times. The atmosphere is nice, the food is really good, and the wine selection is pretty decent. I have always had a pleasant experience so why would this time be any different? Anticipating my next trip to Vegas, I bought a Groupon for $22 towards lunch because it was one of my favorite off-Strip restaurants. Was.Around 11:30am on 10/30/13, my husband and I went in for lunch. We ordered Chicken Parmesan, Chicken Piccata, and Caesar salads. The salads came out and the first couple of bites were delicious, as always. But then, without any warning, I bit down on something hard. Something crunchy and solid. I immediately spit it into my napkin and looked to see what the hell it was. A pushpin. I felt the blood drain from my face. Are you freaking kidding me?! A pushpin? In a salad? How does that even happen? Correct me if I'm wrong, but the manager's desk and everything inside it should not be anywhere near the food prep area. I don't even understand how that happened. It fell into the bowl and got mixed in with the lettuce and croutons? What the hell, people?!So I took a photo of it because there's no way anyone in the world would believe such a ridiculous thing could happen. My husband called the waitress over to show her what had happened. She seemed unimpressed. He then asked to speak to the manager. The waitress went in the back and talked to the manager, but when she came back out she went behind the bar and busied herself and ignored us entirely. Really? That's how you handle such a crisis? That's your customer service policy? To ignore it and hope it goes away? Wow.Fine. So we left the Groupon on the table and walked out. I was completely freaked out by that experience. That could have gone so badly, for me and for the restaurant. If I had bitten down on it the wrong way, or swallowed it, that was gonna be a bad day for everybody. My husband wrote a Yelp review later that day. He included the photo I took of the white pushpin. We all know businesses read their reviews online. To date, not one person, management, legal or otherwise, from Mezzo Bistro has contacted us. Unreal.This is the only bad thing I have to say about this restaurant. But it's a pretty damn bad thing. Dine at your own risk.Man, it seems that all of my favorites are going to crap.I've never been this disappointed in this place. I will admit, the service is always hit or miss.Last night, it was 100% miss.We've had this waiter a couple of times now, and he is horrible. We hardly get waited on, he constantly forgets about our drinks/dishes and he just doesn't seem to care. It's super frustrating.Last night, we had:Portebello mushroom - This is like soup. You have to eat it with a spoon or bread. Such an odd dish. The filet - it was good. Not the best I've had, but cooked a bit over what I had asked. The gorgonzola is super over porwering, so be fair warned.Sea bass special - this dish was not good at all. Super dry, tasteless and it didn't even taste like sea bass. If that was the first time we'd gone there, we'd never go back. They need to up their service an insane amount. They have 3 waiters that we get pretty often and they're horrible. We definitely have some amazing favorite dishes here, but it makes us not want to go just based on the service. We shouldn't have to constantly remind them of what they forgot to bring us or to get their attention just to order.Merh.I wanted to try something differen and this has been on my bookmark for a long while so I came for lunch with my mom and mother in law.They have a scaled down lunch menu until 4pm (according to their site). I ended up getting their chicken parmesan which was pretty solid! Crisp, not greasy and the sauce on it was homemade and had a nice balance. It was one of the better parms I've had in town. My mom enjoyed her chicken piccata thoroughly and I snuck in a bite and thought it was a solid choice too. My MIL got a sausage and peppers sandwich and really loved it because of their tomato sauce. It comes with a daily side which was a pasta salad she didn't quite like, but you can request for other sides too. My mom tends to over order so we got too many desserts. Creme brulee is bruleed tableside which was nice since you can customize how charred you like your sugar. Pizza fritta (or we call in zeppolis) was actually pretty good. If you like fried dough like beignets you might be into these too.  My mom took a cannoli home to my stepdad. Our server was one of the bartenders and he was super friendly and attentive. Great service. Based on our positive lunch experience, the MIL and I came back with my husband for dinner the following week. She got the chicken parmesan based on my positive review on it and she enjoyed it as well. The husband and I split the chicken marsala which was pretty yummy with a perfect sauce and a snapper special from the chaulkboard. Unfortunately, that snapper was way overcooked and had a pretty strong fishy taste to it. We rarely send anything back to the kitchen, but this was not something either of us felt comfortable eating. Maybe not the spot I'm gonna order a fish again, but all the other dishes have been cooked perfectly with juicy chicken. This time service was not as attentive and basic. The plus is that he took the fish back, took it off our bill without any issue, but we weren't checked on. The hubby ate off his moms chicken parm and the marsala and we almost finished the dishes off before we were checked on to even tell him about the fish and request some drink refills. We ended up getting the pizza fritta dessert again and a tiramisu. I haven't had a good tiramisu in a while and that was light with just enough coffee. Overall, solid place for some Italian in the northwest. Definitely would order the dishes we had over and over again (minus the fish). Check for groupons as well, I see them pop up fairly often.
Baked Potato Shop=On this occasion, I feel the Scottish movie-stereotype that usually makes me cringe kinda holds true. Queue on fat, Scottish bastard with his ginger hair and tartan cap saying "get in mah belly". (ref: Austin Powers). Ignoring the repulsive image of "Fat Bastard" himself, this is how I feel about The Baked Potato Shop, in the best way possible.Baked potatoes, or potatoes generally, are Scottish comfort food. It's cold here a lot. We eat 'street food' a lot. Eating street food, outside, can be tricky. And so the baked potato is the perfect solution for this. Crispy skin, soft fluffy centre, and a nice, fatty, mayo-drenched filling.Ok so they're never going to be the choice of the health conscious. But at The Baked Potato shop there are so many fillings, all of which are veggie, that you don't only have to have 1 of 3 traditional fillings (baked beans and cheese, tuna and cheese, cheese.)How about curried sweet corn? Or veggie chilli? Or spinach special? Or three-bean? Or greek feta? Or tofu? Or...oh I forget, there were so many. But basically, all the fillings are veggie and there are at least 10 - 15 options I think. And yes you could go for cheddar with full fat mayo, but there's also some much lighter and at least semi healthy options.Also, after asking the guy why the options were only veggie, he told me that it was originally founded by David Bann. That is, David Bann of the restaurant David Bann, one of the best vegetarian restaurants in Edinburgh - in fact something of an institution. This really impressed me. Apparently he founded in over 10 years ago, allt he fillings recipes are his originals, but he sold it on after 2 years. They kept all the recipes though.So, back to the Fat Bastard recipe. Picture me holding the 'small' portion in my hand with the curried sweetcorn filling, feeling the very weight of it in my hand thinking there is no WAY I would eat it all. 15 minutes later, I'm sitting on a wall on the Royal Mile, scraping spilling curry sauce off my leg (I'm a right proper Lady me), with an empty polystyrine box by my side, and a very happy little food baby, feeling the proud epitome of Scottish, fat-bastard-ness.In a word, The Baked Potato Shop is well good. Delicious baked potatoes, amazing fillings, three sizes (small = 1 potato. medium = 2 potato. large = 3 potato). Hot and cold fillings. Friendly staff. Did I mention that potatoes are just TOO GOOD? Yum.
Marketplace Café="Grilled Shrimp Sweet Corn and Arugula Salad"Tried it. Bought it. Loved it. Bought it again. Resisted licking the plate.Best salad I have ever had in my life!! Seriously, who needs a boyfriend when you can have this salad?!!! The croutons give your taste buds a warm welcome. They are fresh, warm, and delicately seasoned. The spinach is lightly drizzled in dressing (which I think they should rename Heaven). The grilled sweet corn and cherry tomatoes give the salad a little euphoric touch putting all the other salads to shame. Finally, the star of the show: the Succulent, juicy, seasoned to perfection grilled shrimp...Oh.My.Gosh. Have you ever been in love? This salad will make you reconsider.
Harper's Restaurant=We pulled into Carolina Place mall and the smell in the air really got our attention. Such a wonderful smell blowing across the parking lot. We asked several employees where that amazing smell was coming from. Surely it wasn't coming from Harper's.... or could it be?  We have a Harper's in Columbia, but I've never smelled anything like this smell before coming from our location. Sure enough that smell was indeed coming from Harper's. As soon as we finished our shopping we just followed the smell on into the restaurant. They have a Brick Oven. We were immediately greeted and seated in a nice cozy booth for 2. The menu was a little limited but there were still plenty of choices. I had the Caesar Chicken Wrap and Grilled Asparagus. My husband had one of the Brick Oven Pizzas. He cleaned his plate.   The food was good and the service was good. This location is definitely better than ours.
Ouzeri=A very cozy place that serves awesome dishes.Try grilled octopus and lamb, they are so tender and delish~! The prices are very affordable and food is delicious, I recommend this place for casual dinner at any occasion.
Boleros At Seville=Why hello dear friend!   How is darling Buffy today?  Good, good, so glad to hear she is recovering from that absolutely hideous pavement rash from the tennis court.  Dreadful!Jim W belong to a country club?  Perish the thought!  Jim W eat lunch at the country club restaurant, Bolero's, on a 2 for 1 coupon?  Certainly!I found the indoor dining area to be a bit stuffy and I might even venture perhaps a bit pretentious.  Perhaps.  Shall we take our lunch out on the veranda?  Quite so, indeed.  The view of San Tan Mountain is always so splendid this time of year.  Do say!The service was very good in an obsequious sort of way.  If you enjoy the feeling that you are being fussed over because you might be a big macher (look it up here: http://www.koshernosh.com/dictiona.htm) then you will get off on the service here.I opted for a cheeseburger and fries.  I was a little disappointed in the fries, thin, slightly coated and unremarkable.  The burger was very good.  The setting was very nice.OK, Country Club lunch, been there, done that.
Hawthorne's NY Pizza & Bar=8/16/13Great pizza place in sister's neighborhood!  My first visit here was a day shy of two years ago- I found a pic on my laptop of a Margherita pizza from here dated 8/17/11.  I remember thinking the pizza and calamari were great, and my spaghetti-loving sister enjoyed her selection, as well...Tonight, we ordered drafts of YuengLing (BIL) and Honey Brown (moi), a bottle of Corona (with a lime wedge; sis), and waters all around.  Our server Blair was kind enough to let me sample the Waterkeeper Hefeweizen (one of two specials on tap) and the HB http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/hawthornes-ny-pizza-and-bar-charlotte-10?select=XQX6OCUnFv9MacOAbwS-EQ#XQX6OCUnFv9MacOAbwS-EQ before I ordered a pint.  BIL ordered the other draft special, Dale's pale ale, but he didn't like it, so sis asked if he could switch it out for another.  No prob.  For food, we chose the calamari to start, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/hawthornes-ny-pizza-and-bar-charlotte-10?select=69xy3Q3NjSUTRomDOgDj4w#69xy3Q3NjSUTRomDOgDj4w and an 18" half-Elizabeth Special and half-Hawthorne's Special White, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/hawthornes-ny-pizza-and-bar-charlotte-10?select=1kmEdfAxtM0pjzYTyJHDMQ#1kmEdfAxtM0pjzYTyJHDMQ while nephew wanted the cheese pizza. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/hawthornes-ny-pizza-and-bar-charlotte-10?select=lJE9Ugy6CD9wFH-b92flcg#lJE9Ugy6CD9wFH-b92flcg  While I can't speak for my sister and BIL's usual pizza pick (Italian sausage, pepperoni, 'shrooms, green bell, white onions, mozz), sister and I LOVED the HSW, which had ricotta cream sauce, mozz, (lotsa!) pesto, and sundried tomatoes.  I really appreciated the thin crusts served here. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/hawthornes-ny-pizza-and-bar-charlotte-10?select=iSE_JGbw3nZ0Ks3CXN60Cg#iSE_JGbw3nZ0Ks3CXN60Cg  Sister already decided this combo is what they're ordering on their next visit.A great meal out almost always ends with something sweet, and I love tiramisu, so this was a must-try. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/hawthornes-ny-pizza-and-bar-charlotte-10?select=xGX1CO0Jfnq4qwe_WitiYg#xGX1CO0Jfnq4qwe_WitiYg  Sis ordered a slice of chocolate cake for my nephew. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/hawthornes-ny-pizza-and-bar-charlotte-10?select=fIgdOPFPCcLTquIoSyJzGQ#fIgdOPFPCcLTquIoSyJzGQ  They were BOTH absolutely amazing!  I like tiramisu that is rich in flavor-sweet mascarpone, but not cloyingly so, and rich espresso taste, no greasy mouth-feel, and not too light and fluffy, and this was perfect!  (I asked for the powdered sugar to be omitted.)  The chocolate cake is also a must-have!  It was a lot denser than the tiramisu-- almost flourless in texture, or at least the part I ate from was (the outer edge of the cake).  Too bad the busser threw out our take-out containers of sweet treats... They're pricey!  (Tiramisu was almost $6, and the chocolate cake was $8, but come to think of it, the cake slice was huge.)  I even labeled and dated them, but not even two minutes had passed when I thought I'd forgotten my phone and ran in to retrieve it, and our table had already been cleared, and the busser didn't even bat an eye.  We didn't notice that the desserts were missing until we were home.  Make sure you check the tab for accuracy!!p.s.  The Honey Brown lived up to its name, and I definitely preferred it after sampling the bitter hef, but the beer kept impressing me as I ate the calamari (awesome combo) and then progressed to the pizza.  I had my sister try the beer after each course, and she concurred.  I would order this again in the future!
Com Tam Thuan Kieu=Broken rice, broken bits,Broken grains, broken grist,Broken fragments, broken kernels,People eating the broken grains.Ain't no use jiving,Ain't no use joking,Every grain is broken.Fellow Yelpers Brian S and Donald SDined here with me on several platesAnd an appetizerThe service was strong,The atmosphere was nice,The food was very good,Nothing broke but the rice.Every last one, busted clean in half.I had a beef and shrimp paste plate,Served over broken rice,The appetizer we shared was spring rolls,With shrimp and other stuff,They were pretty fresh and tasty,I would go here again,I would eat the broken grain,The prices are pretty good,Your wallet won't be...broken.3/29/10Came here after work as Mom needed to do some light shopping at Mekong supermarket.  Since it was already 815p, she started grocery-shopping, while I placed an order for spring rolls, which Mom specially-requested, and a combination pho.  I've always wondered if the meatball dish was any good, so I ordered that, too.  In less than 10 minutes, our dishes were ready, so I texted Mom to come on over.Mom didn't really enjoy the fresh rolls- she only had half of one, and the other sat in the fridge for three days until I tossed it out.  We also didn't enjoy the meatball platter.  What a waste!  Terrible presentation (unflattering color- could've used some searing action to give the slices a nice crust), horrid texture (clammy/rubbery), and very bland in flavor.  Two bites, and I wondered who would ever order this again?  Not us!  Thankfully, the pho saved the evening!  That is, until it became quite clear, from the heightened energy levels of the cleaning crew, that they were anxious to close for the evening.  We were trying to eat as fast as we could, until I finally looked at my watch and noted it was only 8:45p!  What the...?  Then I remembered that the last time we were there, we were treated the same way, too, but it was understandable, since it was closer to 9p then.Sorry, Com Tam, but lackluster spring rolls, ghastly meatball dish, and rushing us when there was still plenty of time are two reasons too many not to come back!If your truly craving some true Vietnamese food then this is the place to go!! They offer such colossal portions and the service is wonderful too.    However, it honestly wasn't for me, not my kind of taste. But trust me if your a true Vietnamese food lover, then this is your place of food. It's also conveniently located in a plaza that has other small restaurants and a grocery store!!! ***** Have fun!!!******
Snowdon Deli=Aucune critique en français à propos de Snowdon Deli? Honte à nous les francos!Je cherchais un resto à smoke-meat dans le coin, et voilà que Yelp m'indique cet endroit dont j'ignorais l'existence. Je peux y lire à son sujet beaucoup de critiques positives, toutes en anglais, et plusieurs photos de sandwich à l'aspect appétissant. Convaincu par les mots de mes confrères yelpeurs, j'entre donc dans ce resto situé sur le triste et délabré boulevard Decary. J'ai opté pour le sandwich traditionnel (un choix qui ne se retrouve qu'ici) et qui signifie une viande plus épicée qu'à l'habitude. Je n'ai pas regretté mon choix. Le gout d'épice était franchement plus prononcé sans être trop fort ou dérangeant. Les tranches étaient tendres et juteuses, sans ces morceaux de gras blanc que l'on retrouvent souvent dans d'autres resto. En bref, mon sandwich était parfait et gouteux comme je l'aime. L'ambiance? Il s'agit du seul point négatif. Néons blafards, décor défraichi, clientèle locale qui vous met un peu mal à l'aise (genre groupe de p'tit vieux qui se tait et vous dévisage à votre arrivée). Comme pour bien des restos Deli de Montréal, le décor et l'ambiance générale laissent quelque peu à désirer.  Le service est rapide, mais sans trop de sourire. En bref, Deli Snowdon est encore un resto qui offre un bien meilleur sandwich que Schwartz's. Je le dirais donc encore : éviter les files interminables de ce resto sur St-Laurent qui se prétend "incontournable" et venez ici. Votre expérience smoke-meat sera franchement meilleure.
Manzo Pizzeria=Oh. My. Gawd. This place redefined my definition of a sub. Before coming here (subs just aren't big in Australia), all I knew of submarines was Subway - now, I'm not sure I'll be able to eat that swill ever again.This place is a Montreal institution, just look at the other reviews. Don't be fooled by the word 'pizza' in the name - you want the sub. Just the sub. Which sub? I'm glad you asked...Repeat after me: "14 inch number 15, please". That's the Manzo's Special. When I went with my friend (and Yelper Extraordinaire) Matthew P. I asked if I should get two different subs (one for me, and one for my girlfriend), you know, to try things out. His answer was an unequivocal "No. Get two Manzo's" and boy was he right. I could've eaten both on my own, but my girlfriend would've killed me.Do yourself a favour, next tim you want a sub, go to Manzo's. You can thank me after.The Holy Grail of SubsStep 1Order 14 inch, number 15 Manzo special.  (I know what your thinking. "oh that's too much for me, I could never!". Trust me you can, and you will get on your knees after you've devoured it all begging for more.)Step 2The hardest step  Wait patiently.Step 3Carefully transport the warm, divine "Manzo" to your feasting place of choice.  Plant both feet on the floor, lift with both hands and brace yourself.Orgasmic. You may need a smoke after your done. Oh and I told you you would beg for more. Delicious. Fuggedaboutit'
Famous Dave's BBQ=Famous Dave's is always good when nothing else sounds good.  It isn't super fancy or special, but it gets the job done when you want some traditional American BBQ quick!The menu is diverse and has a lot of American favorites on the menu from BBQ beef, pork, and chicken, burgers, fish options, and even salads.  My favorite items are the BBQ pulled pork and the catfish fingers.  YUMMY! I will almost always get one or the other almost every time I visit a Famous Dave's.  Hey, I know what I like!  They also have some great side items to add to your meal.  The spicy mac n' cheese is quite a highlight and delightful, if I do say so.The desserts here are really pretty good as well.  My favorite new dessert is the Banana Pudding dessert.  It is really, really good!  I have to admit that it is at least as good or maybe even better than my mom's Banana Pudding.  Yummy for your tummy!I also have to give props to Famous Dave's because they have Sweet Tea!  It is so hard to find Sweet Tea out West, so whenever I do, I am all over it like white on rice.  I love me some Sweet Tea!  Yummy!Overall, the food here is good, the service is good, and the price is low.  If you just can't decide what you want to eat, you know you can find something good at Famous Dave's.
Cheddar's Casual Café=As I tell you this incredible  story of this restaurant this evening consider this ...                       Would you want to dine at a place that could care less about the value of "every single" customer?"                      Would you dine at a place that all they care about is how many people they can get in and out of the door?                      Would you dine at a place that would lie to you about reservations or tells you a different "story" about the reservations when you get there?Even after you spoke with them earlier that very day? OF COURSE you would not!                        Makes me wonder with this Walmart Attitude( who cares about you there is plenty more coming in the door) for the diner what about the food? Seems like this would certainly carry over. I mean if you could care less about the diner then you could care less about the preparation of the Food!                         To make a long story short about a month ago I called this place for reservations for a Unofficial YELP event I spoke with the Kitchen manager I told him the number of people the time and date his reply" No problem just give me a call the day of to see if you can give him a more accurate number " Sorry never been to a restaurant that after you made reservations they wanted " YOU" to call them back to make sure of the number.I have had restaurant call to confirm my reservation never anything about numbers of people.                           So I get there this evening and first they acted like I did not have a reservation for our group then with a painful conversation  " it" was decided that I did WHAT? I called you about a month ago and then today! So a new seemed like untrained and inexperienced  manager ( Maybe she should go back to Burger King hopefully she was a better manager there)came up and explained" You have to wait until at least have your party comes before we can seat you?"                          I reminded her that I set this up a month ago nothing was said about this and called today and nothing was said about it I told her there was about a 1000 places to dine within a 20 mile radius and we could have went to any of those had we knew this was going to be like a ROOT CANAL !!!                           She left and she said" Let me check on your table " after about 20 minutes she never came back. I told the 14 hostesses that we will go else where and left .                            So Would you go to a restaurant like this? NO ! I have had less reservation problems with having a birthday party at Chucky Cheese!                Cheddar's TERRIBLE !!!Please YELP can we add another rating or two?? And this could be one of the two " What are you thinking??? Dr Phil where are you?" Or Gordon Ramsey  there is this place that I would like for you to try" I would laugh for hours!!!!!!! Just thought I would add a update... after speaking to a few people in this corporation with many apologizes I was asked to return" Against my better judgment"   and was told that" it would not be the same" we are going to retrain everyone! After a few days of thought and the statement " just let us know when your coming"      I kept thinking why let them know that I am coming?For what special treatment? THAT WOULD BE A NO!  So they could really cook ? No AGAIN!  So, I thought I would call their bluff I called the Corporate guys( I think the owners of the franchise) and with a very short fuse I told them I was coming back .      Just as I thought I was sent a message can you give us a "little more time" for what? Are they closing the restaurant to retrain? That would be a NO?         So ask your self this the next time you go into a restaurant or you like to gamble and go to Cheddars what did they cook? I always gauge a restaurants quality by the size of its Sysco or other Food company's  Monthly bill!! The hirer this is the less they cook! And if the value of the customer is any sign how they value the care they take with your meal then take 3 shots of Cabo and call me in the morning.
Maui Rose Hawaiian BBQ=Definitely gonna eat here whenever im in the area!As long as these guys have been here im surprised there are only 31 reviews for this place. Hopefully another positive review will get these guys some more attention. They are kind of tucked away behind McDonalds next to David's Bridal in nice sized plaza.As you walk in you will notice the place is bit small. What you will also notice is the giant menu that is on the wall complete with pictures and all items are individually numbered. So ordering is very simple. The only hard part is deciding what to get because you have a lot of choices.The times that I have been here I have ordered the Chicken and Beef Combo which comes with Miso Soup, Tempura, Salad, and California Rolls. Other times I have ordered nothing but appetizers like their Spicy Tuna Roll and Soft Shell Crab. From this point I am firmly convinced that it doesn't matter what you order here. My assumption is that it will be awesome! Heck my wife was curious about their Udon and tried it. She loved it! Prices are very good for the amount of portions you get. Usually, me and my wife share a combo meal and add a side of something. That fills us up guaranteed!Service  is awesome! It is run by nice family and every time we come here, they are very friendly!So, if you are thinking of going to the buffet at Palace Station or McDonalds, make your way here instead. Your stomach will truly thank you later!I didn't expect to love this place, I was just looking for something quick, fresh, easy, and new (to me). This was one of the few spots in the area to fit the bill. I have a feeling I'll be there regularly.BENTO BOXES: Good for lunch or dinner, but more fun to dine in for the presentation. Kalbi option available if you're not a teriyaki fan.UDON: Available with shrimp tempura or plain, with various combos. Wish the broth was a bit more flavorful but the noodles are perfectly chewy, like springs for your teeth.COMBO SPECIALS: AKA enough food for two people under $10 if you get the large. Kalbi + chicken katsu is my go-to, served with a feast of sides (rice, mac salad, 4 pieces crunch roll, soup, and salad). If you're broke til payday, this meal will last days AND be relatively healthy.SUSHI: ~20 basic and special rolls, several with similar combinations of ingredients (like the Jessica and the Cactus). Tightly rolled with fresh fish and not too much rice. All rolls under $10, wish there were more unagi options.They also have a bunch of apps and sides (spam musubi!), plus fried rice and tempura. Service is friendly and fast, location is more of a grab-and-go joint, as there are only four tables and they're pretty cramped. Small cooler of Hawaiian sodas and other beverages at coutner. Location is directly behind the McDonalds, difficult to see from the street.
The Dogs=Who let the dogs out? I counted 35.  They're everywhere including online (their website is thedogsonline.co.uk). All kidding aside , The Dogs dishes up some incredible Scottish comfort food.Located in and old Victorian walk up in New Town, this small, eclectic, homey space with its miss matched dishes and glasses provides the perfect backdrop to a meal of comfort foods.   Stateside Yeeps think of the bistro in the arts or university district of your favorite city.Straight to it, the haggis. Don't cringe, it sounds worse than it really taste. Extremely flavorful, light livery flavor, chunky and simply delicious. The accompanying potato and cranberry hash adds a creaminess  to the dish. Mixing the fried duck egg yolk and the whiskey sauce with heavy Scottish cream makes the flavors explode.  You'll sit up and beg for more.The ox shin, barley, beer pie is outstanding. Well braised pieces of ox shin in a heavily extracted beefy soup with a hint of sour bitterness from the beer pairs perfectly with the barley and root vegetables. Dipping the buttery, flaky crust into the broth is an added enjoyment. A true tail wager.The only questionable flavor came from and Asian inspired duck confit. While the duck was perfectly cooked and the accompanying salad in prune vinaigrette delicious, the dish seemed a mismatch to the other classics on the menu.Finally for dessert, a warm, creamy toffee rice pudding topped with crisp, deep-fried honeycomb and dark chocolate.  Great texture and flavor With complexity from honey. Sweet but not cloying. I definitely rollover for this.Short and very well chosen list of beer and wine. Very reasonable pricing.Extremely friendly and welcoming service.Overall a great value with most dishes less than 7£.Sit, stay, heel, speak, shake, jump, rollover, play dead. When it's this good, why not. Woof woof.
Restaurant Santa Lucia=I often hesitate to order pasta at an Italian restaurant, thinking that I could easily do a decent pasta job at home myself. And then I had Santa Lucia's linguini alle vongole with white sauce. I take my food reviews seriously so believe me when I say nobody... yes... nobody in Montreal could make pasta sauce that unforgettable. It just has that 'wow' factor that makes you start planning your next trip before you even finish the dish. Proof: I've been going there and ordering the same dish in the last five years. So there, 'nuf said.PS: the place looks like someone's outdated living room, so if 'hip' is what you're looking for, this isn't it.
McGinnis Frontrow Restaurant=I actually worked here briefly during university so I can give you the inside scoop on this place.It's run by a guy named Dino who owns a few other restaurants, but essentially, it's a pretty independent establishment which should be an up since it's always nice to support the littler guys.Their food is actually pretty good considering that at heart this is a university sports bar. All of their chicken is fresh, never frozen. Their stir fry's were my favourite menu items.They have a great patio with televisions, high top tables, and if you can time it right you might also be able to snag a few of their comfortable lounge chairs.Inside there are booths with individual televisions, a bar area with high top tables, a party room that accommodates sports teams and a big screen television with tables in front of it for all the big games, fights, etc.
Ocean Prime=Finally, I made it to Ocean Prime...I'd been wanting to try it for months, and Saturday night it finally happened.  We couldn't get a reservation since it was Restaurant Week, but we took our chances and found the perfect spot at the bar.  Natalie, the bartender / server was awesome... I'd go back again and again to hang with here at the beautiful bar if only it wasn't so pricey or if the food was deserving of the prices... not exactly the case.Jared went for the three course Restaurant Week menu.  For $29, he had their house salad, a 7 oz filet, and sorbet for dessert.  I didn't find anything on that menu quite as appealing as the Chilean Sea Bass off the regular menu, so I splurged and went for that despite the $32 price tag.  I also ordered a side of steamed broccoli for $8.We were offered fresh bread but declined it... our wedding is just a few weeks away, so no need for extra carbs!Jared's salad came out pretty quickly and he shared a few bites with me - we were off to a good start - we cleaned the salad plate!  Next up, Jared's filet arrived with my side of broccoli.  The server who delivered it put both plates in front of Jared and said "anything else I can get you?"  We both answered at the same time "just my (her) sea bass."  He then went to check on it.Ten minutes later, my sea bass came out.  It looked good but when I went to cut into it, it was tough.  Now, I've had my fair share of sea bass - it's my favorite fish.  I've never had tough sea bass before.  Needless to say, we sent it back.Just as Jared finished his meal and we finished the broccoli together, the GM, Walter, came by to apologize.  He told us they were preparing a fresh piece of sea bass for me.When he asked if he could bring me anything else, I said sure... (I really wanted to try the glazed carrots).  It was awhile, but my new sea bass came out awhile later, as did the glazed carrots - and both were tasty.  Not amazing, but good.  Lucky for us, they ended up comping my sea bass and carrots.  Jared's lemon sorbet was served after I finished up... it was a generous two scoops.So, what would have cost around $100 on a typical night was half the price due to the *off* sea bass.  Would I do it again for full price?  Probably not... but if someone else is footing the bill, sure - I'll give OP another shot.9/19/11Came in for Ocean Prime's $40 Restaurant Week deal.  I've never been to OP, but I went in thinking I'd try the seafood.  However, after looking over my very limited choices (two seafood choices, $24 to $27, and steak), and at the suggestion of the server, I ordered the filet mignon ($32) , w/ the first course of side salad.  I arrived at around 15 minutes to 7p, but by the time I was seated by a host, served water, offered food and wine menus, greeted by the bartender, and then met my server, it was just past 7p, and I'd missed happy hour, which ended at 7p.  I was told that I could order happy hour apps at the discounted rate, but not the drinks.  I decided to forgo apps and alcohol and ordered my meal.I really liked the atmosphere at the lounge area (dinner seating next to the bar), even though it was a little too dark for my liking.  I felt that the room should've been a little smaller to match the intimate setting, but whatever.  Besides two couples, a lone diner, and me, the room was empty.  Outdoor seating looked inviting.  As I started to relax in this dark space, I decided to try the Strawberry Smash, realizing just minutes before receiving my table check that the drink would not be offered at the happy hour price of $7!  At $12, it was just a tad pricey, but considering the atmosphere, it was not bad.  (Honestly, I was expecting a lot worse!)  I'd definitely come back for happy hour!I was getting hungry, and it was almost 7:30p, so I asked if complimentary bread was offered (yes!) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tSJTbxhAO1tJMSdeTCiZwg?select=7_-HKOKCU89N1xGIymWorg.  The sourdough roll that appeared seemed a bit too small, but again, whatever.  It had a nice bite, and it came w/ whipped butter.  My cocktail http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tSJTbxhAO1tJMSdeTCiZwg?select=ZJNXrNmhMWUDKJU5PJzC2A was simply delicious!  Just sweet and tart enough for me not to notice the potency of the alcohol within- perfect!  Side salad http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tSJTbxhAO1tJMSdeTCiZwg?select=c0OWt3dKEA311b6sPgy-DA was nicely portioned, and tasted great.  Loved the combo of goat cheese, tiny bits of walnuts, and tart Granny Smith apples.  Had to forgo the mustard vinaigrette due to an allergy, but the sweet house dressing (wine-based w/ "lots of sugar") was good, if not a bit too sweet.  A taste of this dressing was enough.  The filet mignon (medium temp.) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tSJTbxhAO1tJMSdeTCiZwg?select=_zUDU5iVZaQWfXp_Im1s5w was tiny, but cooked to perfection!  The roasted garlic was buttery and potent and complemented the potatoes.  However, I would never pay $32 for a 5 oz. steak, with only the roasted garlic on the side!  Never!  Last, I had the creme bruleehttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tSJTbxhAO1tJMSdeTCiZwg?select=WucqsiKbTkzmz7X2huxBxg w/ berries.  I really enjoyed this dessert!  Very creamy and perfect in its texture, and the berries meshed nicely against the vanilla custard.  I'd have liked a bit more berries, so I stole the drunken strawberry from my cocktail and had it with a scoop of the brulee... ahh!!  My one complaint w/ the sweet dish?  The sugar coating was VERY thick!  It had to be about a quarter of an inch thick!  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tSJTbxhAO1tJMSdeTCiZwg?select=CMfhGJdpG66djDTo35SNiw http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tSJTbxhAO1tJMSdeTCiZwg?select=Oct9Oo6WCdzZg3hzYHGnGw Most of the brulees I've had had crusts just thick enough to muster a cracking noise when you lightly tap it w/ a spoon.  I definitely had to give this a few wallops.  Not very classy for such a "dainty" dessert...Overall, a nice experience, but certainly not worth the $68 (tip included) I splurged on dinner for one...
Cafe Nirvana=We've been fairly disappointed with the Indian food in the Charlotte area, so we stopped in to Nirvana with low expectations. We left with a new go-to place for Indian. AtmosphereThe atmosphere is slightly upscale, though it's comfortable enough for jeans and a nice shirt. Nice Indian music was playing and we had a comfortable booth by the window. The place is smallish, in a typical plaza storefront box, but done very nicely. ServiceWe received service on par with other Indian restaurants I've been to. That is to say, it was everything you need and nothing more. I'm a fan of this, as I am there to eat and not chit chat with an overzealous waiter. FoodPerfect. Everything was delicious. Rich sauces without being too rich. Buttery Naan bread without being too buttery. Filling without being too heavy. Complex layers of flavor that make you think that Indian chefs are magicians more than chefs. We had the Naan bread where you get to pick 3. My favorite was the fruit and nut Naan, it was like a mildly sweet dessert. Everything was perfectly cooked and stunningly delicious. My wife and I ordered 1 appetizer, 1 meal and the Naan, and left full and had enough for leftovers.CostWe found it to be a bit more expensive than other Indian restaurants in the area, but well worth it for the increased quality and taste. If you are in the Ballentine area (slightly north?) it's a great place for a fantastic dinner.Celebrity most likely to enjoy eating here: Tina Fey. She would butcher the names of the food but she'd eat it like there's no tomorrow.  Half hour to live and I have to get my last meal here: I'll just tilt my head back and you can cram as much malai kofta in there as possible.
The Lodge=This will be my new lunch time hangout!  The Lodge has a nice variety of food.  Something for everyone.  We had Potato skins as an appetizer with a terrific cheese dip.  For lunch we had a  Viena Polish Sausage with caramelized onions, taco salad and chef salad and fries.  Everything was great.The service is fast and friendly.  I love the atmosphere.  It reminds me of a fishing lodge in Canada or Alaska.  Very comfortable, TV's on the wall and a pool table and couches in the back.  The music is eclectic, playing one great song after another from many eras and genres.  Just a great place to hang out!The prices are very reasonable as well.Already looking forward to my next visit!!!!Four of us ended up here for dinner last night. My first impression of this place was weeks ago, late night, for a quick drink. I enjoyed dining here better...The atmosphere is dark and lodge-like, and I like it. The food is basically above average pub-grub and an excellent value for Scottsdale. Drinks were stiff and service was brisk. We stayed for a couple hours before heading to a birthday party at Drift which is just a few steps from The Lodge, as are a dozen bars and clubs. I think this is a great way to start a night out on the cheap.A ski chalet/mountain lodge on a flat corner lot in the heart of the club scene in little old Scottsdale, Arizona. That's what The Lodge is...does it work for you?I don't know...it doesn't really work for me.I come from ski chalet and mountain lodge-ville, originally...I have spent so very much time in them, so I kinda know whereof I speak:)When you walk into a log cabin up there, it really is a log cabin, not a remodeled First Watch (with stucco on the outside and faux log's for wall treatments inside...BTW, as a side note, The Lodge must have bought all the mints from First Watch when they took over...exactly the same mints on the way out the door:)And finally, when it's 102 in the shade, pretty much the last place I want to be is in a "cozy" log cabin...that's a place for warming up après ski, by the big fire, drinking beer and schnapps' until your long underwear melts:)The whole feel is a just a little off...like sushi at Houston's (no, I'm never getting off that one:)I needed lunch today and I thought about trying The Lodge. The last time I had lunch at a place with the word "Lodge" in its name, it was halfway down one of the back runs at Park City...it was also 5 degrees with a dry, powdery snow falling.It's a brisk 85 today in Scottsdale...certainly a cold snap for this time of year, so I thought "what better way to warm my bones than a visit to my local ski lodge":)I was going to try to schuss over to The Lodge, but my ski's are in storage, so I bundled up and walked over.The Lodge has a reasonable menu...in fact the menu is an awful lot like the menu at that little lodge off McConkey's Chair at Park City...burgers, sandwiches, salads, etc.I ate at the bar and had a Chicken Club sandwich that was OK, along with string fries and a drink for $9.75, not including tip (BTW, the service was very good at the bar and I tipped generously:).So the prices at The Lodge are way better than buying a chicken sandwich in Utah...I don't think I got out of that place for less than $20 for lunch for one...what are you gonna do...it's cold, you're hungry and they are the only game on that part of the mountain:)I understand the prices are even better at happy hour...good for them:)All in all, The Lodge is really pretty average, in terms of food and service...they are fine...just fine.I don't know how the concept of mountain lodge will finally play out in a desert town, but I know where to head when the snow flies this winter:)I'd been to The Lodge before on a few occasions for drinks but last night after the OYE was the first time I actually ate there... and I really did eat there - I went for it; I splurged; I ordered a big fat burger and sweet potato fries!I like the atmosphere at The Lodge much better than the clubs in Old Town.  It's not pretentious and I don't feel like you have to be dressed up to go there; it's a more casual kind of place.  Warm and even cozy... sure, it's more of a guy's place but they are not lacking in the female department - they've got plenty of chicks that hang there too - some of them may be getting paid by the hour, but they are still there.I was happy to see a ton of yelpers hanging out when I made my way over to The Lodge last night just after 9pm.  And I was starving, so I put in my order right away... and like I said above, I went for a burger and fries instead of my typical salad.  Unfortunately, I didn't get the burger I ordered.  I requested a burger (cooked medium) with no cheese but with lettuce, tomato, and fried onions.  Instead, I received a burger with cheese, bacon, and who knows what else... but I was so starving that I ate it all and I really enjoyed it too!  And those sweet potato fries?  Yum!Whether you're up for a drink or two, or to splurge on a burger and those sweet potato fries... The Lodge is a great alternative to the Scottsdale scene.  I just hope that next time they get my order right!The Lodge is the manliest of manly bars. And when I say manly I mean, Midwestern manly, put on your camo's and trucker hat, pack up your PBR, jump in the F150 and head out to set up post and shoot some f'n deer... type of manly. There are stuffed animal carcasses and heads everywhere, chandeliers made out of elk antlers, carved wooden bar stools and bears (ahem Adam W.. carved wooden bear alert!) and tree logs used in every way possible to decorate. I think there was also a fire place, but I was so fascinated by the post taxidermy coyote that was posing so mysteriously on the mantle. I guess its because anything dog related I am gravitated to.. either way, its always interesting looking at something so close that you've never seen before. That or I'm 5 years old. Another type of manly is that they use grilled cheese sandwiches as the BUN for a burger my friend ordered. Seriously,  a hamburger patty with all the fixings in between 2 grilled cheese's. Maybe this isnt manly, aside from the ability to be able to devour that much food..  so maybe its just ungodly fatty and unhealthy. Anyone participating in the "Fat Off" should not come here to eat. At all. And anyway I tried that burger, and it wasn't the shit. However, I did enjoy the criss cut fries and their ranch dressing is to die for. I need the recipe now. I crave that flavor.Its an interesting location for a place like this to be.. hidden among the trendy brodeo joints that I avoid like the plague. I liked the rustic feel this place had, and felt like drinking my Makers on the rocks was completely acceptable in a place like this. I don't care if its an 85 year old man drink, I love it and no one at the lodge looked at me like I had 10 heads when i ordered it, like everyone else does at most places I go. Plus Its got an extremely decent outdoor patio area fully equipped with heat lamps for those brisk desert evenings. Waitresses are nice, and cute which is always a plus, and the bathrooms didn't make me gag. So bravo. I don't see this place as becoming a regular stop while in Old Town, but I wouldn't mind going again. They have a super happy hour thing going on.. $3 beers, half price apps, $6 burger & beer.. cant beat that, plus  I love log cabins, and this place certainly reminded me of just that!I have been to The Lodge on several occasions, but was reluctant to write a review before I had tried some sort of food item. Beer is pretty much the same everywhere. This was the chosen spot for the post-OYE hang out. Like Nikki F said, this is definitely a man's man bar. There are stuffed cadavers of all sorts of fured and feathered animalia. Obviously by the name they are trying to give you that ski lodge/cabin feel. They have accomplished just that. There were lumberjacks and snow bunnies everywhere you looked. Well, maybe not, but you could picture them. Dallas G and I each got the black bean burger and I'll be damned, it was tasty! Lettuce, tomato,and onion topped the patty. I will say it could use avocado or something, but still good. Tater tots accompanied the burger on the plate. Oh, how tater tots harken back to a simpler time when all you were worried about was whether or not the next GI Joe or Transformers cartoon would be on after school. I think Amber W had some sort of salad, but I wasn't really paying attention.Interesting side note. Two very attractive and scantily clad women were chatting up two Tony Soprano look alikes at the bar. Now, I am not judging these two women, *however*, they appeared to be "on the clock". These guys were not that charming and they certainly weren't that good looking. Brady K and Jared M both confirmed my suspicions.So check out The Lodge. You may just see a hooker.I must be a snobby snobby bitch. Nope... just sober.Trust me, I tried to remedy that as quickly as possible so I could deal with this place. We were there on a Saturday evening around 9. Maybe it's okay as a Sunday day drinking spot but I'll never know,  because I'll never be back.Long story short:I came uncomfortably close to getting into a physical altercation with a man. Yes, all 112lbs of me and some of you will be surprised that I was not the instigator. I was NOT. You know that look.... that certain "sociopath" type look that serial killers have; the eyes are set a little too close together and their head slightly resembles a loaf of bread, pinched in at the temples. Well that's this guy....annnnnnd all of his equally roided out homies. The experience was actually scary and I don't scare easily. "Killer" wasn't the only reason for the sour taste in my mouth. The place was a little campy/cheesy and not really in the way I like. I can't really put my finger on it but it just wasn't my thing. The service was slow but the place was packed to the gills with every ass clown on the planet, so I'll cut them some slack there. We wanted to eat but there was no place to sit, as any of the open tables had reserved signs on them. Oh........reallllly, bottle service anyone? LAME I'm not sure if that was the case or not, it just seemed douchey and try hard. ShockingI will say one thing. This experience and the few others that I've had leading up to it have made me come to terms with something very special. I don't belong here and by here I mean Scottsdale. Unless of course someone would like to take me to City Hall for a sexy steak dinner. That's my idea of a good time. I doubt highly I'll fear getting punched in the face at Mastro's. Fuck I'm old....This is the exact place I love to hate. But I can't. I cannot hate you, Lodge. I just can't!In fact, if this place didn't have taxidermied animals (yes, I just made a word up) and antler headpiece things as chandeliers, I would probably be giving this place 5 stars....... I KNOW! I can't believe it either!!My first experience with The Lodge was as Yelp Bachelorette. I was hammered (give me a break; it was the most important day of my life so far) so I didn't think it was fair to review after not really "being there," if you know what I mean.My second experience was last night with THE Bachelor himself, Dallas G. Yet again, the staff was incredibly friendly, quick with the service, and willing to accommodate my vegan, gluten free existence without fault. They have an amazing black bean veggie burger and orgasm inducing sweet potato fries.  DG could learn a thing or two from those fries.Just Kidding. Now, here is the BEST part of all: THREE DOLLAR SKY VODKA DRINKS FOR THE LADIES.You don't need to know the rest.Stuck in Scottsdale but yearning for that lodge fire and hot spiked cocoa on a cool mountain air evening? You can either find a way to drive to Flagstaff or cab it to the Lodge and be whisked away to the imaginary world of mountainside living. When the Lodge first opened, I was a little confused. Why would Scottsdale think they could pull off a lodge when it's 100 degrees so many months out of the year? Who would want to hang out in a lodge? Then, I walked into the lodge and I was immediately mesmerized but its charm. I don't care if its 50 or 120 degrees outside, there's something adorable about the Lodge and I visit time after time. It's cozy, cute, reasonably priced, full of good food and has a whole slew of games to choose from. In the front room, groups can sit and watch the game on the big screen or catch up while they eat and drink. In the main area, visitors can stand around with the bar goers and be "Scene" for the night without being too scene. And if you are in the game mode, head back to the most lodgy room in the building where they have Big Buck Hunter, pool tables, darts, and other random games. And then they went and did something glorious. They added a patio to the Lodge so when the weather's nice, folks can sit outside and play Giant jenga or bags. I can hang out at the Lodge for hours and be content. The food at the Lodge is actually good. It's the kind of food where I actually eat there when I haven't had too much too drink. You can't say that about many bars in Old Town. Have you tried the potato skins? They aren't your average skins. They are crunchy and you dip them in the cheese queso dip. To-do-for and you probably gain five pounds immediately following. The TLTA is a favorite as well. It's honey roasted turkey with a creamy aioli and fresh avocados on crispy bread. Their cottage cheese is some of the best out there because it's spicy but not really spicy and has red peppers in it. I also enjoy their chicken sandwiches, burgers and of course the sweet potato fries. Throughout the year, the Lodge will host a variety of events in their parking lot. I've been to a skateboarding one and a surfing one. Yes, surfing! They are always a blast and worth the money. So when people are looking for a fun way to drink the day or night away or have a American meal, I suggest the Lodge. Well done Lodge. Can you clone yourself around town?Before I went to visit Scottsdale for the first time, people told me that I'd be heading into the Marina of Arizona. For those of you who are unfamiliar, the Marina is a young, social neighborhood in San Francisco where recent college grads and polo shirts run amok and where I spent some wonderful years after my own college graduation. After visiting the fair city of Scottsdale and especially after my time at the Lodge, I wholeheartedly agree with this comparison, but it's not necessarily a bad thing. And one thing that the Lodge has over the bars in the Marina is a very important thing: the drinks are CHEAP. In fact, the night I went there they were offering 20 oz of any beer on tap for a measly $5. For that kind of steal, I'll deal with baseball caps, polo shirts and low-cut jeans for days!If the lodge didn't over charge my card 3 visits in a row, I would recommend this place. Instead I have to expose them for the repeated credit card errors they have made! Maybe this will force them to hire some honest servers, but probably not! This has also happened to two of my other friend several times as well... very disappointing. This past Saturday, We went to the lodge at about midnight for some late night snacks we ordered $30 worth of food and drinks. My friend and I split the bill (So about $20 each after tip).  She messaged me today to see if I was billed for the meal, because her card was charged $30. I checked my account and they charged me $40, and these were posted charges, not pending!!  This has happened too many times and every time I have to call several times to dispute it, and a manage never happens to be around.  At this point I'm convinced that their servers do this intentionally in hopes that people will be too drunk to remember what they did or leave their receipts behind, so they can't dispute it.  Well I definitely was NOT drunk and I know I was ripped off.  You have lost a customer because of your bad business practices and dishonest servers.The Lodge is located on Douche Boulevard, just off of Bimbo Lane and around the corner from Boob Job Square. There are times when I've come here and had a great time, played some games with friends, wasn't perturbed by Douchey McDouche-tards and drank some cold beer. But then.I was here last night and arrived before my friend. The bar area was full, so I had to take a seat at a table. And then waited. And waited. And come the F on! Fake Boob Job Waitress, I know you see me sitting here! And just because I'm not a table full of dudes pretending that my fat is really muscle, I would still like to purchase a damned drink. For serious. I finally get my drink order taken and delivered (after she flirts some more with the pudgy dudes across the way), I continue to wait for my friend. Like magic, as soon as HE arrives, she appears almost instantaneously to take his order. Whatever.I very seriously doubt I would come back here of my own choice.  Maybe if I sprouted a penis and wore an ironic teeshirt or button down plaid shirt stuffed with muscles I would. But until then, I'll stay away.I've been here a few times to meet colleagues for a drink after work.  It has a nice wood interior and the booths have plenty of room for people to sit comfortably even when it gets packed.  Parking can be difficult if the area is busy, so arrive early if you want to park close.The happy hour menu is pretty good and so is the food.  My two favorite apps to order are:Cheese CurdsPretzelThe Cheese Curds are especially good....you can't find them in very many places and the few that have it aren't as good as this place.  The Pretzel is pretty awesome too.Overall, it's not too bad of a place.Return Factor - 75%
America's Taco Shop=This shop is a converted house in the Coronado neighborhood of downtown phoenix. It has just opened.I ordered the carne asada tacos and they came in a corn tortilla with guacamole and grilled onions and they were really really good, they are street tacos style My wife ordered the quesadilla vegetariana and she really liked it, she liked the jamaica Mexican water even more!They also offer coronitas, which is nice if you just want a small beer.The only thing i didn't like was the ambiance, it was missing some music, and the fact that it won't be open on Sundays. But, with $2.25 tacos you can't go wrong!My boyfriend insisted this place was great so I gave it a try last night. I felt bad at first walking in at 7:45 since they close at 8 but they were more than happy to take my last minute order. The torta is amazing. It was not too greasy, just perfect. My boyfriend had the carne asada burrito which was delicious. All the ingredients tasted very fresh. I had an Horchata which was excellent too. The salsa is definitely the best part. It very unique. I know that people keep saying blah blah renovated homes but I still think they are great. I will be back for sure.Best "street style" carne asada taco I've ever had.  The Vampiro is basically the same think but it comes on a tostada so you have to pick it up and eat it like a vampire, thus the name Vampiro.The salsa is great, I don't know what "style" it is because every now and again I've had it other places but it's my favorite. It's a cross between a pico and a red sauce, blended but not runny at all.Yes they make you pay for chips and salsa, and I've seen the tiny tablespoon size take out container for salsa so beware.Cute restored house.   I'll be back soon, if not everyday from now on.I had no idea this place existed even though I've driven past it a ton of times. It didn't really catch my attention. When my husband suggested we go there, I said "Huh? Where?" Been there once, definitely crave it again.The carne asada burrito was delicious, and it was the perfect serving size. I was able to eat it all but I wasn't left hungry or unsatisfied either. They could definitely use some help in the service/usability department though. When I first walked in, I had no idea where the menu was (it's written in chalk on the walls in very large print...so large I didn't even think to look at it as a menu). Mmmm...I want a burrito now.This is a little gem.  Sometimes it's best to do one thing and do it really well.  America's does carne asada REALLY well!!  The meat is tender and flavorful and delicious!!  I had a carne asada burrito and it was probably the best I've ever had. But let me speak of the guacamole.....mmmmmm!!  If you like guac, this is awesome guac!!  It's got just enough kick in it and it is very tasty.  Their chips are fresh and crispy and a nice compliment to the guac.  My daughter loved the cheese quesedilla and ate the whole thing.  When we got in the car to leave she said she wanted to come back the next day!  That's high praise from a six year old!The shop is a cute little house with several tables inside and a nice seating area outside.  Parking can be a little of a challenge.  There is only one way in and it's the same way out.  So if you're leaving and someone is coming in, well....you get the picture.  The staff is always friendly and accomodating.  They make you feel at home.  The prices are reasonable so you don't break the bank either.  Thank you America!!Besides the little street taco cart that is parked in a lot on 28th st and Mcdowell that I go to for my carne asada tacos...this comes in 2nd place:)  I am really picky about carne asada...many places make them either too dry or not flavorful enough...well not my little street taco cart,,,,and not my America's Taco shop!!!I order two things here..Tacos and Quesadilla....I normally do not eat quesadilla, but here its something else...Cheese, moist and perfectly seasoned asada, with grilled sauteed onions all between a light crisp homemade tortilla?!?  What else can be better??  Well, maybe there are other things:)  But for this moment, during my 15 sec of fame...I mean review....Lets amuse ourselves:)  Go...you will not be disappointedYes, the bean and cheese burrito was good.  Yes, I'm glad they don't use lard (then it's vegetarian).  It was hot and cheesy.  But, it was just beans and cheese.  Nothing fancy.  I won't rave over it.The chips and salsa were OK.  I would have liked more salsa, but since you have to pay extra to get them in the first place, I didn't want to get charged more.The highlight of dinner?  The horchata!  I even got a refill to go as I left.I will probably go back, but I won't be craving it.I drive by this taco shop treat on a daily basis and love shopping in the Melrose District. Mexican food restaurants line the streets of Arizona like every day is Cinco de Drinko, so I had to check them out and see how they earn the title of America's Taco Shop. During the work day, I'm on the hunt for lunch spots where I can be in and out without a true sit-down experience. Someplace with an outdoor patio is a plus, unless it's a sauna outside. America's Taco Shop had just that. You enter and order at the counter, then you can chose indoor or outdoor seating. Sadly, it was a bit windy when I went and in addition to my plastic silverware running away from me, the misters decided I needed a mid-afternoon shower. With such Yelp reviews, I felt the pressure when ordering my food and wanted to make sure I got the real experience, so I asked the cashier what his favorite choice was. He said the Carne Asade Burrito was hands down his favorite. I'm not going to question the man who lives and breathes by the restaurant.  They brought me chips and salsa while I waited. The chips tasted fresh and probably homemade. The salsa had a hint of a kick to it but not enough to send you to the fire hydrant. Then came the burrito. The tortilla was homemade, fresh and like it was straight from Mexico. Very tasty! The burrito itself was pretty darn good. I'm a sucker for guac so I wish I'd asked for some on the side. I've been to my fair share of Mexican restaurants and this burrito pretty much melted in your mouth. So on days when I'm a lunchtime loner or the social butterfly with friends, I'll definitely recommend this spot for tacos....wish I could have tried the margaritas. Cha Ching! The cashier pointed out two great traits. 1. Taco Tuesdays: four tacos for $6.00. Not bad! 2. Happy Hour. The happiest hour of them all with $2 beers and $1 tacos. Looks like I'll also be making a stop on my way home from work!Americas is a place that I had to visit more then once before I reviewed. It is good. The carne asada was tender and had a nice charred flavor. The bean and cheese burrito was good. The chips and salsa were bland, the salsa was "tomato sauce" as one of the 10 year kids said. The price was a little high esp $1.50 for each can of pop. That is $9 a six pack....On the way home from work yesterday, a friend wanted to meet up at America's Taco Shop for a snack & catch up conversation and chisme -- You know me, I'm all about good tacos & chisme! I ordered the Carne Asada Burrito -- delicious & full of flavors. Somethin' about the recipe they use for the carne asada alone makes it special. I look forward to returning -- now that it's cooler, outdoor seating will be ideal. Cheers***
Bay City Diner=Good Cheap Eats with Downtown Atmosphere!!After reading the other reviews I really don't know what NEW I can add!!This place is NO frills, Cheap & OK fair with OK service-Nothing memorable but the atmosphere and CAST of characters you are sure to run across here.If you don't wanna wait in a long line, pay alot of $$ for little "gourmet" dishes and you like a little pie with your meal-Give it a go.WARNING: Sit at the counter at your own risk. High traffic and it's kinda gross they put all the dirty plates,etc in bus tubs right under the counter in front of you as you eat!!!
Ruby Tuesday=Ruby and I have had an on again off again relationship for about 12 years now. It's been close to 3 or 5 years since our last scandalous meeting.I like that Ruby has attempted to change her look with choices such as mashed cauliflower, and spaghetti squash. I even liked that she shows a bit extra with the calorie count on 'some' of her options. Makes choosing that much easier, although she does hide the calories on most of her selections. My thought on that one is that she likely doesn't want to scare you away by showing too much on items like her bacon, cheese, avocado, Angus burger. I can only imagine the distressed thoughts I would have had if I had seen the truth before ordering the meatloaf. Thanks Ruby for making it easy to splurge this time. ;-)Apparently, about a 1/3 of Ruby's gastronomic repertoire now comes with her salad bar at no added cost, and my choice of meatloaf just happened to be one of those as well as the wife's grilled chicken. It turned out to be one of those surreal moments for me. I was excited to get a seemingly free bonus, but at the same time would THIS be the day I break the no buffet style dining promise I made to myself and the wife on that fateful day back in aught nine?Unluckily for me, Ruby had left a little something extra mixed in with her 'mixed greens' that day. Who knows, maybe it was Ruby, maybe it was one of her ladies in waiting, or maybe it was just a random customer with a 10 inch locks. Either way, I was fully unappetized after serving myself some salad with a side of dark brown hair. Maybe I should have jumped ship at this point, but how was I to know it wasn't going to get much better? The food was average at best, and the wait staff didn't seem overly apologetic about the added locks of love incident. In fact, the first waitress I showed this to didn't even take the plate from me, I had to hand it to the bartender behind the bar myself before I could get rid of it.The meat loaf was 'mehh, whatever' and the grilled BBQ chicken wasn't any better. The only saving grace here was the cauliflower and spaghetti squash; but truly, those are dishes that can be made easily with a few minutes of prep work at home. Needless to say, I didn't walk away from this meal with a happy ending. Sorry Ruby, but our on and off again relationship is officially off, but never again. Your services will no longer be traded for my hard earned cash.
Café Raymond=I stopped into Cafe Raymond with my parents for breakfast when they visited town last Sat.  My original plan was to take them to DeLuca's, but unsurprisingly, the line was long. Since I hadn't been to Cafe Raymond before, I figured this was as good of a reason as any to stop by, so I suggested it and we headed in.  Although it was fairly busy even here, I was able to snag a table while they ordered, so we were able to tuck in as soon as our orders came up.We ordered the following items: blueberry lemon ricotta pancakes for me ($8.99); blueberry French toast for my mom ($8.99), and cheddar cheese omelette for my dad ($8.99).  Despite seeming thick, the pancakes were surprisingly light and fluffy because of the ricotta, and the lemon added a delicious tang.  Even without the syrup, they were very tasty, but the syrup added some nice moisture.  My mom let me try a bite of the French toast, and the bread was light, but had a nice crunch.  The star of the show was the compote, however, which was just sweet enough--not overly so--and showcased the ripe fruit.  I didn't try my dad's omelette, but he said it was also quite fluffy, and was filled with a decent amount of cheese.  As can be seen from the photos, the presentation was also quite nice, a welcome change from the norm at many diners.The staff were also quite friendly, and were prompt about wiping off our table after my mom spilled some coffee on it.  While the prices are a bit steep, I think they're warranted, given the sophistication of the food and that credit cards are accepted.  Overall, I'd say that Cafe Raymond has one of the best breakfasts in the Strip (hence my rating), so don't hesitate to stop by and try it if the lines at the competition are too long, or if you're looking for something different than the usual.  I look forward to dropping in again soon to try one of the lunch items such as the tomato mozzarella sandwich.This place wasn't as busy as I thought it would be, especially for Sunday brunch. There were still enough customers to keep most of the tables occupied though. I didn't like the concept of having to order at the counter because I didn't like having to make my decision of what to order under pressure, as there was a line forming behind us. I ended up hastily choosing the French toast. Boyfriend got the BLT. You can help yourself to tap water, which I tried to do, but the pitcher was empty and had to be brought to the counter for them to refill. (I know they are busy, but honestly water is pretty important and they need to find a better way to dispense water if they can't be attentive to the pitcher.) The table we sat at had crumbs on it from the previous diners and the knife and fork given to me for my French toast looked dirty. Luckily, my French toast with berry compote was good. I also loved the way the home fries that came with the BLT were seasoned. This place does have good brunch food, so if you don't feel like waiting in the long line at Pamela's around the corner, try Cafe Raymond, but don't have high expectations for service or cleanliness.

Blue Fin Sushi & Roll=I feel like I need to write an update since somehow I am the only reviewer and I last reviewed in November 2008.  This is hands down the best sushi place in Vegas.  I grew up eating Gulf Coast sushi in Houston and always thought that was the freshest, the best...but seriously, Chef Jin gets fresh fish daily, and gets his hands on anything exotic.Last night he treated me to madai, Japanese snapper, a fresh fish he sliced off the filet during dinner.  He is always creating new things.  I just go and never order - he makes whatever (knows what I like and what I don't), and he and his wife (the outstanding waitress and hostess Yura) are so kind.  I get matcha iced tea without asking.  I have a favorite seat.  They put on sports on the flatscreen when I come in.Honestly, I worried when he added all-you-can-eat because the quality is too good.  You can get any roll, any appetizer (including hamachi kama), any salad, any nigiri, handrolls, ikura, uni, sweet shrimp, tempura, mochi, you name it - for $25.95.  I only do all you can eat on a rare occasion because I usually just eat nigiri and maybe a handroll or interesting creation.  Rolls are too filling for me.In summary, the food is great, the service outstanding, the atmosphere quaint and casual, the prices reasonable, the green iced tea yummy, hot sake ready, and for the special occasion, I get the chocolate souffle for dessert.  I couldn't live without this neighborhood joint!  Just see my zillion pics for food inspiration.Another review goes out to Lisa L.! We are always on the lookout for great AYCE sushi - and we're bigger fans of the fish itself and not the rolls.  Blue Fin Sushi definitely impressed up with the quality of their fish.First off, Blue Fin is a small restaurant - more like a mom and pop's place.  It's almost better to keep this place on the down low because I would hate to have to wait for a seat here.Our party of three plus toddler went for the AYCE dinner option at $25.95/pp.  First off - uni, limit one order per person and dinner only.  Because of the weather in California, they did not get their shipment.  Oh.  Would they be willing to give us an extra order of amaebi then?  Yes.  Sweet!  And when it arrived, it looked just fabulous and tasted good too!We went to work ordering a bunch of nigiri and was pleasantly surprised with how they came out.  More often than not, AYCE sushi places just shove as many pieces on a plate as they can.  But they actually presented it quite nicely for us, which we appreciated.  We were especially impressed with their super white tuna, which I am certain was escolar.  (Super white tuna usually means albacore, so escolar is definitely a highlight!)  Their version of ikura was a bit different - it actually seemed like they made it themselves since the eggs didn't separate and were still within the sac, if that makes any sense.Another highlight was their spicy rolls - I'm not a fan of the Sriracha-based kind and this was mayo-based.  Yum!We also really enjoyed their Soft Shell Crab Tempura (limit one order per person, dinner only).  It had a nice batter and was definitely tasty!The Husband ordered the Grilled Yellowtail Collar (limit one order per person, dinner only), but hoped they had forgotten since he was getting full.  When it did arrive, it was a huge piece!  It looked like the equivalent of two collars usually served at other restaurants!Another highlight - unlimited dessert! Green tea and red bean ice cream, mochi ice cream, and tempura ice cream are available.  The tempura ice cream is a huge scoop and we were surprised with how generous it was.Service did take a bit long, and we were there for a good while, more than the hour time limit.  But there was only the only waitress and the restaurant definitely was filled to the max while we were there.  In this case, we didn't mind - but if it was just the two of us, we might have gotten a bit anxious.Overall, Blue Fin Sushi is a place I would recommend for good quality sushi.  I can't comment on their fancy rolls, but we liked what we ate and would definitely go back!There are outdoor tables, but I'm not sure it they open them up when the weather gets better or not.Lunch (11:00 am to 3:00 pm) $21.95/ppDinner (3:00 pm to 11:00 pm) $25.95/pp60 minute limitUpdate! (05.12.10)Went back for a return visit and we were both pleased with our experience there.Only a handful of customers sitting at the sushi bar, and that's where we chose to sit as well.  Ordered a bunch of nigiri and they had uni this time as well.  The soft shell crab was served up on a nice bed of salad greens with a sauce on it this time, which wasn't a problem since we asked for no sauce the next time.  Overall, we took our time and was out within an hour.  They didn't disappoint on quality at all.With so many AYCE sushi places in Vegas, the wife introduced me to Blue Fin Sushi, and I think our sushi cravings have found a new home in Vegas.   The fish was of better quality in comparison with other AYCE places.  The pieces fish were chilled (not warm, like in some places we went to) and exquisitely sliced in large portions (some places do a hack job!).  I think the wife and I are purists because we tend to focus on nigiri, instead of the rolls.  This is the main reason why I will come back...the sushi rice.  The sushi rice is amazing here. It has been seasoned so well.  The texture of the short grain rice flavored with the slight hint of sushi vinegar is absolutely perfect for me.  For example, when I take a bite of the super white tuna nigiri, I first taste that slight hum of rice vinegar from the rice on my tongue.  My tastebuds then witness the sweetness and slight creamy flavor of the fish as it slowly intermingles and compliments the vinegar flavor from the rice as I chew.  The wife and I also request that certain sauces should not be poured on the nigiri, such as amaebi.  I just want to taste the rice and the fish, and chew slowly so i enjoy every bit of it. yummm.  The other stand out item to order here is the soft-shell crab appetizer.  This is probably one of the best places that this is prepared.  They use a panko coating/batter and deep fry the think.  It's like eating pork tonkatsu, except instead with a crunchy and crispy crust covering a moist and  tender soft-shell crab.  Definitely, we will be frequenting this place more often.  Plus, I still need to go back to try some Okinawan beer.Finally was able to go and give the much recommended Blue Fin Sushi on the SE side of Las Vegas a try.  I was there because of an UYE Lunch event hosted by Jessica R, plus also in attendance was Lisa L who organized the last UYE dinner event there. And it was totally worth skipping the free meal at Aria's employee dining and shelling out the $25.95 (dinner AYCE price, because I wanted to order the uni, amaebi and hamachi kama that is only available during dinner AYCE).  Not only was the food we ordered as good as I imagined it to be, Chef Jin (the chef/proprietor of Blue Fin) also made some special (off menu?) treats for us. The "Shiso Special" would make an excellent amuse-bouche at much fancier restaurants up and down the Strip. It is diced sashimi (tuna, salmon, and yellowtail) flavored with fresh herbs, sesame seeds, Chef's secret sauce, covered with fried shiso leaf, garnished with masago (red, and green), ikura (salmon roe), and truffle oil. To start off the meal, we ordered a lot of nigiri (yellowtails, salmon, uni, amaebi, halibut, red snapper, bunch of spicy tuna and hamachi hand rolls), and Chef Jin hooked us all up with Yellowtail Belly (not part of the regular AYCE menu).  All the sushi were fresh and delicious. Our waitress did her best to try and take orders from all five of us, and some of the items we tried to order was left out, but it was no biggie. The food we were served were great and we ordered more in our second round.Recommendation:  If you go for AYCE, even during lunch (11am-3pm), and you enjoy uni (sea urchin), amaebi (sweet shrimp) or hamachi kama (yellowtail collar), it is worth it to pay the few extra dollars for the dinner AYCE price and be able to order those item.The restaurant is relatively small, so if you plan to go with a group it is best to call ahead and make a reservation.The iced green tea looks great and is probably healthier than plain iced water.Come hungry for AYCE :)Rating breakdown:Service - goodFood - excellentAmbiance - nice, plays cool musics (some 80s) but not of Japanese artists.Interior - clean, limited seating.Price - about what most other AYCE Sushi restaurants charges.Location - great for those living in the SE Las Vegas or near UNLV, but worth the drive if you live in other parts of Las Vegas.  -  Out of Town Visitors - It is worth it to rent a car if you plan to venture off Strip to this sushi restaurant. Your cab fare back and forth would probably be more than 1 day's rental rate.I feel this restaurant really earned a 4.5 Yelp Stars in my book.  And next time I will see if Chef Jin needs anyone to stage at his restaurant, because I would enjoy learning from him.Blue Fin is my favorite AYCE in Vegas.  There are other good spots in town to get your sushi fix, but Blue Fin is the only place that I'll do AYCE alone.  That may sound anti social, but really, the sushi here is good enough that I'll dine all by myself and not have to worry about sharing.  Not that you have to worry about sharing, it is AYCE after all...but most of the time, doing AYCE is a group affair.The fish here has been consistently fresh during my visits.  There are always different specials on the chalkboard to try out.  The rolls here are creative enough that I don't mind ordering one or two (I've very much become a nigiri and hand roll kind of guy).  You can also do half orders of rolls to make sure you get as much variety as possible during your meal.So perhaps the last paragraph can apply to numerous spots in town...but the one thing that I think does it for me at Blue Fin is the sushi rice.  It is delicious, and I do not mind ordering nigiri in lieu of sashimi.  I like the rice that much.  It may be a little thing, but it makes my tastebuds happy.Blue Fin's another one of those special places, the kind where you have to stop by if you're in the neighborhood.  I'm looking at you, Sunrise Coffee!  It's a perfect two-hit combo of an evening.I love Blue Fin. Just come here. End of review.No really. Just come here. They have AYCE sushi. AYCE sushi is top secret code for we love feeding you sushi until you burst. They have some amazing sushi. Speciality sushi rolls are all the bomb. Ultimate blue fin, volcano, and *** are just some. Some of the rolls are loaded with sauce so just ask them for sauce on the side or ask for half roll as is.I even did the hand rolls which comes in a stand that can hold 3 hand rolls and sometimes they're so big that the stand can't hold it so no stand is used. Try the salmon skin hand roll its good.For nigiri all excellent choices. I had lots of nigiri uni with quails egg, tako octopus,... Get the garlic ahi nigiri drool.The poke salad was ok. It was stretched out with lots of non-ahi ingredients like some of the other sushi spots here.They didn't have oysters on the AYCE menu and I didn't order shrimp tempura but everything else was amazing enough to make me not care about it. For desserts they have red bean ice cream, not small scoops but regular size ice cream scoops. Mochi and fried tempura ice cream. All that are also AYCE.So good that I almost did AYCE lunch the day after I did AYCE dinner. When's the next time. I'm actually craving sushi today. Next time has to be tonight LOLPremature yelp review post. Noticed I wasn't finish.I've had this place bookmarked for ages, so hopefully I didn't just have expectations that were too high.We came here today because my fella was craving some sushi. I insisted we skip our favorite AYCE sushi, Goyemon to try this place across town. From the first bite, my fella was disappointed. After every bite I got that look from him like, "see, we should have gone to Goyemon," I enjoy sushi rice, but this was just so overwhelmingly vinegary. It's the only flavor we could taste. I like to taste the flavor of the fish, but all I got was overwhelming flavor of vinegar in every single bite. I was very disappointed. I ordered a little of everything. Plenty of nigiri, salmon skin handroll, green mussels, agedashi tofu, seaweed salad, tempura calamari and a few other items that I can't remember. The seaweed salad was really sour and not my favorite version I've ever had. The salmon skin handroll was pretty good. I like the salmon quite a bit, that's usually one of my favorite things to order at every sushi place. The only thing that was annoying was how flimsy the handrollls were put together. They fell apart so quickly and made a total mess. The calamari, tofu and mussels were all pretty tasty, although I prefer my mussels in the shell. I would order all three of those again. All the nigiri was fresh and really good, but I had to dab each one to remove excess vinegar from atop it, to make it more palatable. The desserts were pretty good. My fella felt vindicated a little when he ate the tempura ice cream with green tea ice cream and then quickly ordered another to finish up the meal.Service was pleasant and efficient. I hope this was a one off for this resataurant, since I see so many great reviews from Yelpers I respect.I never did think that I'd be able to replace my favorite sushi restaurant (Sin City Sushi), but, it has happened. Well, sorta. I cannot completely write off Sin City, because once you have Young's garlic sauce, or his mussels, you will seriously crave them for days after... but, Blue Fin executes all their dishes delightfully well.Jin, the owner (I believe) is from Hawaii. The first night I went with my boyfriend, it was a quiet Sunday night. We were served by a young woman who was also from Hawaii. Service was fast, friendly, and extremely patient!  Blue Fin has an exceptional selection of rolls, appetizers and nigiri.My boyfriend and I usually get a lot of nigiri, and that night was no different. We had garlic tuna, hamachi, ika (with salt and lemon), amaebi, cajun albacore, tako, and a bunch more.Great fish to rice ratio, and the few rolls that we did try were a good size (*PLUS, they do half rolls!*) They have awesome appetizers. I love mussels, but the mussels here are a little different from everywhere else. So just be aware that when ordering mussels here, they are already off the shell, and come in a special dish. We also had their tuna crab cake, salmon skin salad, and "poki" ( i always spelled it poke.. hmm)All came with shredded beet and carrot toppings. I don't like beets AT ALL, regardless of what Dr. Oz says about the nutritional value they possess, it detracted from what would have been all together delicious, again, my own personal opinion.Anyway, the restaurant setting and my overall experience here leads me to conclude that this restaurant is a solid 4 stars. Their quality of fish is on the higher end as compared with some other popular names in the AYCE sushi world.Will go back if I'm in the area.Yelp, you have failed me!  I had such great hopes before visiting -- from all of the 4 and 5 star reviews and from the consistent Sushi threads in the talk forum.I think what happens is that the trend reviews really skews reviewer's perception.  Either that or I just went on an off day.In regards to overall atmosphere, appearance, quality of food, and variety, Blue Fin doesn't come anywhere close to Goyemon.   This is coming from someone who believes that Goyemon has been on the decline of late.I left Blue Fin full, feeling sick, and wanting my money back.  What the hell is in the sauce on your eel and rolls.  Do they put cornstarch in there to thicken it?  The Udon soup tasted foul as well.  The fry they use in their soft shell crab and agadashi tofu was definitely not japanese.  The only saving grace of this place was their salmon skin salad which was delicious.  Still, there is no reason for me to come back.   There's probably 100 sushi AYCE places in Vegas and I would rate Blue Fin as average.This week was my first time and wasn't disappointed. I've had Blue Fin Sushi & Roll bookmarked ever since I've read all their positive reviews.  Last week I had overall poor experience at a sushi restaurant in San Diego. I don't want to embarrass I-Sushi so I won't mention their name.  I knew redemption was needed and needed quick.My visit was during lunch time and chose their AYCE for $21.99. I want to add that from the outside, this joint looks bigger than it really is.  The ambiance was perfect around 11:40 AM for someone eating alone and we all know for the best service, you have eat at the bar near the sushi artists. There was only one other patron here at the time. That only lasted about 20 minutes because once noon hit, the fans started showing up. Every seat was taken and a line was forming by 12:30 PM. Just keeping up with the Jones'. Just another sign that Blue Fin is the way to go.I had a couple of items for my AYCE venture;-Nigiri: Yellowtail, Salmon, and the Garlic Spicy Tuna-Rolls:  Tried their Rock and Roll, which is a cucumber wrapped roll with crab, tuna, salmon, and yellowtail-Hand Rolls: Spicy Crab and the Crunch ShrimpEverything I've tried was delicious and fresh. I thought that the Nigiri's were small, but it's all you can eat. Order more if it's not enough.  I did just that, I ordered and ordered until I was able to erase my last poor experience in San Diego.  To be honest, the food was so satisfying here that just my first nigiri already made up for it.This review cannot end without commenting on the service. 5 stars for service alone. Even though I was just one of about forty that was eating here, they made me feel like a rockstar (no, not the energy drink).  Watch these guys in action. Rolls, bowls, and shashimi's ordered and delivered with the quickness. All it takes is some eye contact and they're ready to take your request.My only gripe about this place...it's on the opposite side of town from where I am normally at. Guess that's not their fault. On a side note...thanks to all the fellow Yelpers that either gave suggestions for next time or wished me a good lunch due to my experience over the weekend. You guys rock!!The more AYCE sushi I have in Vegas, the more I appreciate a la carte places: they typically have the quality I want, without the obligation to overeat to "get my money's worth". I'd be in trouble if I lived closer to Blue Fin, because it's a good combination of the best of both worlds!Came in on a random weekday evening, sampled a bunch of their apps (the poke was a bit spicy, the screaming o was mostly sauce, and the tempura soft shell crab was a flavorless half crab), lots of nigiri (the garlic tuna and spicy garlic tuna were both standouts!) and a few of their rolls (the featured special roll, CM4? was the best). Fish was fresh, rolls were tight, rice was correctly portioned, and even better than all of the above was the service. Like I said, I tend to overdo it at AYCE joints, but the servers here were super-fast and nonjudgmental- every time more food was brought out, they'd ask without batting an eye what we'd like next.
Hokkaido Teppanyaki Steak House=I've never been a fan of the whole teppanyaki experience.  Growing up in San Francisco, I used to watch the tourists enjoy the theatrics at the famous Benihana restaurant in Japantown.It all looked like fried rice to me and I always wondered how the food got properly divided when you have multiple parties at your table.After watching a teppanyaki competition on the Food Network, I realized there was a bit more to just cooking on a propane-heated flat surface grill.First off, it helped that the Husband and I had the teppanyaki chef all to ourselves.  Sure, it's not likely you'll get that experience, but it definitely contributes to a good or bad evening.  Chefs with a good personality will give a good show and everyone will have a good time.I chose the Chicken and Scallop Combination Dinner ($24.95), while the Husband chose the New York Steak and Chicken Combination Dinner ($26.95).  They both came with miso soup, ginger salad, steam rice, shrimp and seasoned vegetables.  The waitress was a smart one - she offered edamame to start when she got our beverage orders.  And suggested the fried rice option when we put our food orders in.  We declined and she offered one order so we could share it.  For $2.95 more, we upgraded one of our steamed rices to a fried rice.When it came down to it, our chef was entertaining and engaging.  He did a few tricks that we didn't see during the competition, and that had us a bit surprised.  He was friendly and personable, and it did make for an enjoyable eating experience.Food-wise, we were both pretty full surprisingly.  Was it worth the $50?  Not really.  (It helped that we had a BOGO free entree with the Entertainment card.)  It was definitely something to experience at least once.Not only do they have teppanyaki tables, but regular tables and a small sushi bar.  Most diners were enjoying the teppanyaki experience here though.Reservations recommended, especially on Mother's Day! Four of us enjoyed good service, typical show with juggling knives by teppanyaki chef making corny jokes, good tasting lobster/filet mignon/NY steak/chicken/shrimp/veggies/fried rice/miso soup/Japanese salad and side of Rainbow Roll. All food was cooked to order/perfection, nice restaurant decor, friendly staff especially the hostess who doubled as a waitress.Over priced for a little bit of food, as typical for this type of meal; but it was a special occasion this Mother's Day so we tried this place and have no regrets!
Tortas El Güero=Having gone to the 16th Street location a few times figured it was time to hit Mesa and try the one closest to us. Okay, so you drive through the ghetto, then you hit a nice part by the art center and then ghetto again.. this is definitely a great way to see the cultural diversity of Mesa. Be on the lookout for an old Long John Silvers building and you've found Tortas El Güero.. Me and the Mr chowed fiercely! Torta Alambre.. steak and bacon sizzled with peppers, onions and cheese all on a toasted roll.. outfuckingstanding! Dowse this big'un in the avocado salsa and  your tummy will be warm and toasty for hours! The quesadilla version, just as awesome! Pastor was amazingly tender and almost as huge as the Alambre! This one dip into the chipotle cream for some spicy creamy goodness! Tortas are 4.99-6.60 and they are HUGE, one will do you.. me and the Mr just over order and over eat when we go out.. that's probably why were so fat, and so happy!
Spicy Tuna Sushi=This is a pretty solid non-AYCE joint in Henderson/Anthem area. My husband and I were in the area and I have had this place bookmarked forever, plus it was recently recommended by Matt S, so deciding where to have early dinner was no brainer.We started with a couple of (underwhelming) appetizers: Calamari Tempura and Bacon Maki. I was not impressed with either selection and let my husband finish both. The calamari was 90% scrape-the-roof-of-your-mouth-raw tempura with a small chewy bit of octopus. Bacon Maki was scallop wrapped in bacon - I mean I am a fan of anything wrapped in bacon, but this combo didn't work for me. The bacon tasted rubbery, old and microwaved. We ordered salmon nigiri and scallop nigiri and both were fantastic. The cuts of fish were quite large on a tiny bed of rice, and most importantly, they were fresh.We ordered 3 rolls of sushi as I typically like to balance out my rolls. I generally opt for a havier baked roll, a spicy roll, and a very simple and fresh roll. We went with:Sun Devil RollSmoked salmon, cream cheese, avocado, ebi, spicy crab, sliced jalapeno, served w/ yum yum  (4/5)Rainbow RollFresh tuna, salmon, yellowtail, shrimp, halibut on top of california roll (5/5)Kiss of Fire W/ Extra Spicy SauceShrimp tempura, spicy soft shell crab, spicy tuna, crab, cucumber, albacore (4/5)We topped it off with two orders of mochi.The total pre tip was ~$70 and based on the portion and quality of the fish, it was well worth the money. The interior is spacious and clean, and appears to have the neighborhood appeal judging by some of the regulars that were there. The service was friendly and accomodating.I would both recommend this place to others and come back myself.Let me get mathematical on you for a minute.If salmon + crab = awesome, and tomato + avocado = delicious, then adding shredded radish and applying ponzu sauce via the distributive property equals the phenomenal JUSTIN SPECIAL! Shout out to the supporting ingredients: furikake, sesame seeds, and scallions. Okay that last part was theater, not math, but whatever. TLDR: Get the Justin Special, you won't regret it.I really wanted to like Spicy Tuna Sushi but it just wasn't for me. They were recommended so we stopped here for lunch.  It's between Trader Joe's and Kmart off of Eastern.  The dining room is very large with plenty of bar seating.  I was disappointed that they didn't offer any lunch specials with so many other places that do.  Oh well... I wasn't going to leave.  We tried a few different plates.  The Japanese Lasagna roll was good.  Crab and cream cheese baked with cheese on top.  That was right up my alley.  The Gonzo 2 roll was presented beautifully.  This roll had shrimp tempura, spicy tuna, spicy crab, cucumber, seared albacore and crispy onion.  With all of those wonderful ingredients it fell short.  Yeah... I was surprised too! Plus it's just too hard to eat.  Most of the inside fell out just trying to pick up one piece.  Oh well.  It was worth a shot.
Red Oak Cafe=Firstly, I overheard the cashier making very rude comments about a mentally challenged customer who had just left.  Even if these were   this employee's personal feelings I think it's in poor taste to express those kinds of thoughts in a tone that is audible enough for your other dining customers to here.I had to settle for Red Oak because the seating in both Starbucks and Caribou Coffee was all occupied.I ordered the banana and Nutella pancakes that were on special for $5.50.  Just the pancakes no sides were included.  I was hoping more then anything fruit was served with the pancakes..since the place appears to promote healthy food.  When dining in Toronto two slices of fruit usually comes standard but the same is not true around these parts.  Just a slice of honey dew would have been a cheerful addition to the pancakes but no such luck for me. The pancakes were cooked perfectly.  I also got a blueberry mango smoothie that was really delicious and tasted very much of real mango and not of mango flavored syrup. What I did not agree with was the silverware system.  I assumed which I shouldn't have that I would be given silverware. However you have to get your own silverware.  I told the cashier when I placed my order this was my first time dining there it would have been nice had she pointed me in the direction of the silverware after learning that information.There is a reason why this place was practically empty when the surrounding restaurant were packed.  The food is expensive. I saw on the chalk board menus that salads go for as much as $9.00 dollars there. I'd go back for another smootie but nothing more then that.
Imagine Spain=I was lucky enough to be invited to an evening at Imagine Spain last week, before their Grand Opening.  (They are now officially open).  So, I cannot speak to the pricing although I have a feeling it's reasonable.  I can, however, tell you that the paella at Imagine Spain was just as amazing as the paella I remember eating in Valencia years ago!  This may be due to the fact that one of the owners is from there and brought the recipe with her!  I can also tell you that the sangria (I had the red) was so delicious - I couldn't get enough of it.  Good thing Jared was driving that night!The decor is simple but cute... and the people were extremely welcoming... except for when Jared went into the women's bathroom because someone was in the men's and he really had to go - i don't think they were too happy about that!Overall, if you like authentic Spanish food and a laid back, simple atmosphere, take a trip to Imagine Spain - it's the next best thing to the real thing... and much less time consuming and cheaper too!  Buen provecho!
Little Sheep Mongolian Hot Pot=As far as hotpot goes, I think that this is the only decent one in Montreal so far.  Located up on the second floor with ample views of the mean streets of Chinatown, a window seat is almost mandatory for the full experience. The three most important things for a delicious hotpot are:-robust broth (so I recommend only ordering their spicy herbal broth)-fresh vegetables and thin sliced meats-a well-made dipping sauceThe well-made sauce portion of a good hotpot meal relies solely on you, the patron, to make at the sauce bar.  No one is going to hold your hand through this process, but I can attempt to give you a quick recipe for a good one;  2:12 hot chili oil with bits, 2:12 soy sauce, 1:12 sesame oil, 2:12 scallion/chives, 2:12 cilantro (a must have), 1:12 vinegar, 1:12 paste/minced garlic, 1:12 ginger paste.  There is also a sesame paste sauce that can be made using diluted sesame paste, but I like spicy.Don't be afraid of the watercress, and try making a hard boiled egg.  The cooked egg is delicious peeled and then dipped into your dipping sauce.There is also a small buffet portion set up that has things like spring rolls and sesame balls.  But, I found these items not to be very fresh.  There is also an all-you-can-drink soda and juice fountain that actually has some delicious sweetened soy milk on tap and orange juice.
Yum Yum=Yum Yum!! This place holds a special spot in my oft drunken heart.After a long night out (as most nights are in Scotland...if you're doing things right that is), I would routinely found myself in need of a falafel/Donner (as one does), but had no idea where to start my quest for greasy nirvana. Now if you don't know, not all chip shops are created equally; they all lure you in with the heavenly aroma only triple fried meat and potato can make, but few live up to the hype. You could  try one of the small ones on Rose Street, or stand in line with tourists  on the Mile, but you'll end up with basically the same level of food; it will absolutely get the job done (trust me!) but won't leave you super happy. If you're looking for something that is better than average, Yum Yum is the answer. I personally like the one on George 4th Bridge, but the other one (which I've only been to in a fog, couldn't tell you the address) was also quite good. The guys running the place got to know us over the week we were there (good thing?...not sure lol), and were very friendly every time we showed up. Walking in, you won't find a lot of space to sit, which was A-OK with us, as we were on our way home every time we stopped by*. The place next door (painted red, can't remember the name), is huge and also smells heavenly...but the guys are rude, the food is meh, and the extra seating allows youths to sit/loiter for extended periods of time (thanks, but no thanks).  Speaking of food, Yum Yum is spot on. I recommend the Donner and chips, but the pizza is good, as are the pies and fish. Seriously, you can't get hurt at Yum Yum**If you find yourself out past last call in this amazing city, and need some Donner to soak up some of the party you just drank down, look to Yum Yum for the hook up. _______________________________________________*Just a side note; chip shops like this should only be visited in the wee hours of the morning, if this is your main stop for lunch you're doing Edinburgh wrong. **This is a lie, if you eat here too often you will most definitely die of a heart attack...but hey we only live once right?
Jimmy John's=Again great experience, they really know how to greet you at the door and everyone loves the job and working with each other, I don't know what your putting in the water but keep adding it, cause its working! I'm a fan! and will spread the word!
Il Terrazzo=Jared and I went on a date to Il Terrazzo for dinner on Friday night.  We had a gift card valid for dinner for two, and we were waiting for the perfect night to use it.  Friday night was just cool enough to sit outside and enjoy the patio at Il Terrazzo, and we did just that...Service was spot on, ambiance was great, and food did not disappoint either.  I forgot how much I am a fan of the Phoenician's homemade bread until our basket came... pair that with the dirty martini I ordered and I was one happy camper!  But of course we didn't stop there.  I had a Caesar Salad and J went with the Caprese Salad to start.  He ordered Veal Ravioli for the next course and of course I had to try it... it was creamy and heavy but in a good way.  We definitely could've stopped there but too late - our entrees were on their way!  J went with the Kobe Flat Iron and I had the Scallops.  Way way way too much food, but we did take home leftovers.  We passed on dessert but still left with full bellies.Il Terrazzo is on the pricey side.  As a matter of fact, our gift card covered everything but my drink, and my one martini was $19.77 before tip!  Pretty insane, right?  I'm not sure we'd rush back on our own dime, but we'll be there in a heartbeat if someone else foots the bill!For August breakfast club we headed on over for Sunday Brunch at IL Terrazzo, and let me tell you, this brunch is decadent! It was an Italian Market Brunch, just a beautiful spread of lovely dishes.I have been searching all over the valley for the perfect eggs benedicts and I found them here at IL Terrazzo, the 64° farm egg benedict is creamy, perfectly cooked and just perfect! It's the way an egg should always be done. This was perfection!There is a lot of items to choose from, I'm sure every picky eater could walk away happy.I also tried the Arizona tomatoes, tuna tartar, delish shrimp, shaved prosciutto, handmade mozzarella, other cheeses and meats with breads and a few other items. The brunch spread is extremely nice, and perfectly portioned, most everything is in small single servings. Oh and the desserts, oh my they too were heavenly!This was a great Sunday Brunch and I do look forward to coming back!
La Mestiza=People get fussy about Mexican restaurants. Is it authentic (which region?)? Is it Americanized? Is it just like the Mexico they saw when they went on vacation? Are they from SoCal or Texas?  There's a place for platters of rice/beans and cheese covering 'something' underneath served with chips from a bag and red or green sauce. Then there are places that seem more real. La Mestiza is one. It's a notch or two up in feel and decor from Tac.Guadalajara and a bit fancier and pricier that La Guanjuatence. The menu is more limited and they seem to want to focus on doing a few things really well. They succeed. They have Negra Modelo on tap, always a good sign. Real Margaritas (talking to you La Guanjuatence!) are a win. The chips were freshly cooked, hot and delish!  Spousal Unit had the Chicken Mole enchiladas. I love mole. Theirs was good and she loved it. A little too sweet for my tastes and it could have been spicier (I say that a lot in Madison). I had the Yucatan classic, Cochinita Pibil. Nicely presented and flavorful. Unlike some of my favorite Mexican places, this is a place you could go on a date.It's not Taqueria Guadalajara, I'll tell ya that much. But it's better than a Doritos Locos at 2am and that says a lot coming from a guy who's a 2am Doritos Locos connosuier.Hands-down my favorite place to get tacos in Madison. And, I'd swear I've already reviewed this place, but apparently I haven't... Hmm. Suffice it to say that I've swung through here at least 7-8 times since discovering it a few months ago.+ Happy hour. $2 Tecate, $5 for 3 street tacos. Runs until 6pm. Outstanding.+ Delicious house-made tortilla chips+ Tasty salsas+ The street tacos. OMG. Finally!!! Someone who knows how to season and sear asada. Everything about these tacos is perfect - fresh, steamed corn tortillas, mounds of delicious steak, mild white onion and fresh cilantro. Yes, yes, yes. + Service is always friendly and prompt+ Nice selection of traditional Mexican brews, all at fair pricesThis is my favorite Mexican restaurant in town. So many reasons - and every time the hubby wants to go to the Other Decent Mexican place, I have to run through my list!1. The best chips in Madison- are freshly fried and served with 2 homemade salsas, spicy chipoltle and avocado/salsa verde. These are brought out right away. (we have never waited longer than 1 minute.)2. The margaritas are made with real lime juice and are delicious!3. They have Negro Modelo on tap, most nights.4. The chef KNOWS what he is doing in the kitchen. He cares and this is shown with the way he plates his food and the general freshness and attention to flavors. The guacamole is fantastic. The cochinita pibil is Amazing. The steak ranchero is perfectly cooked. And the lamb chops!!! The fish tacos are very good. All the other tacos are great too.After 3 years of eating here, we finally met Chef Antonio because we go crazy about the lamb chops special. This is only available sometimes on Wednesdays and only if you ask for it. :) (OK, now I have let the cat out of the bag)But You can have chicken enchiladas if you want.
The Codfather=This is a really decent chippie, and a great local to have. The fish is all fried fresh, and the portions are really generous.Fish and chips shops need to be rated and enjoyed in their own sphere of "good vs bad". Bad are those places where they mass produce and serve on main high streets, where the food sits under heat lamps, dries out and most of the customers are too drunk to realise that it's like eating cardboard. Don't forget the soggy chips.Really amazing fish and chip shops are those that are situated on the coast, you can take your grandma too for lunch and whilst it's still deep fried, it's fresh and light and crisp and wonderful.The Codfather, on top of having a wonderfully punny name, is on the 'good chippie' side of things, yet still a late-night joint where you wouldn't take your grandma for lunch, but you would go if you were still sober or wanted a mid-week cheeky fish supper. The batter is still pretty thick, but it's fresh and crispy, and the fish is SO fresh and the portions are large and delicious.Highly recommended, and I only wish I was no longer GF...
Bar-B Barn=The owners transplanted from the States and set up this Montreal landmark that's been around since the 1970's!Solid BBQ.. served in a barn! Well, it looks and feels like a barn -- if a barn were two stories smack dab in the middle of a major metropolis. Very homey and down to earth, absolutely nothing fancy or hip-and-happening.If you're tired of all the fancy French food and French women and French beer (yeah, craziness I'm sure), you can come here for a slab of Americana. Their portions will blow you away. They only serve two things: roast chicken or ribs. Men: order "The Whole Hog" and prepare to be humbled. So good, but you'll never finish it all.P.S. Whatever you do, don't let your friends convince you to check out Baton Rouge. It's a Lousiana-style chain and it's pretty bad, especially their bland ribs. Bar-B-Barn or bust!
Chez Parra=Restaurant Chez Parra is a great little French restaurant in Longueuil, Quebec, which is a suburb of Montreal on the South Shore, just across the waters form that thriving international city.It is long and narrow, with a Salon Prive (private room) in the rear, which our party of 6 occupied, amidst original art decorating the walls. The ambiance is simple, understated, casual elegance and cozy. The menu has traditional French specialities, such as Foie Gras for appetizer, and mains like Duck l'Orange, Veal, and even Rabbit. There are a few other mediterranean infuences like Canelloni and Carpaccio from Italy and  Paella from Spain, and they have several seafood selections like more than one salmon and a trout dish, as well as other popular meat favorites.They have a very affordable 3 course daily  evening special, with appetizer, main and dessert for under $24 CAD (under $20 USD at today's exchange) and most of the entrees a la carte are $18 - $24 CAD,with appetizers in the $6 - $10 CAD range.  They have an adequate wine selection appropriate for their food offerings. Service is very attentive, with the owner/manager  providing personalized suggestions and service. This is mostly a hidden, affordable gem for locals, but if you are ever in Longueuil or along the south shore of Montreal, this would be an excellent, affordable choice for good local French food.
Thai Elephant=If you love a place so much that you eat it for lunch two days in a row, and upon finishing your second lunch you question whether you should go there for dinner, or just wait for lunch tomorrow, the place deserves five stars.As others have mentioned, they are a little pricier than other Thai places around the valley, but the lunch tofu dishes are $7.95 and come with an egg roll and vegan hot & sour soup, and it is well worth it.I'm one of those fat kids in a skinny-ish body, because I will eat every last bite on the plate in front of me. Generally the portions at Thai places are so huge I feel like a whale after I leave, but Thai Elephant does a good job with their potion sizes (at least for lunch) leaving me satisfied but not feeling glutenous. I need someone to provide me some damn control, because I have none :-pQuick, friendly service. Clean, comfy interior. No complaints. Try the Siamese Basil or Drunken Noodles with Tofu. Both are amazing. Unless you want to crap fire, I suggest getting nothing spicier than medium. Enjoy the visual!!I've dined at Thai Elephant a few times, but more often than that, I've ordered food to go, and I have not been disappointed.  If you're considering Thai food, you cannot go wrong with this place.  As a matter of fact, I'd recommend going out of your way for food from Thai Elephant vs any other Thai in the Valley, even if it may be closer to home.I highly recommend the Green Curry and the fresh rolls, although I haven't had anything from Thai Elephant that I didn't like.  I'm definitely a fan of this place and I'm craving it now just thinking about it!
John Cutter=John Cutter is a fun little restaurant! It is totally A-Ok in my book.  Here's why I think it is ok:1. Decent size menu with a lot of interesting options.  Lots of your traditional stuff with little twists to make them a bit different from the rest.  We went during breakfast, so I will focus on that for now.  A couple of examples of fun food would be the breakfast quesadilla, crunchy french toast, and a breakfast Philly cheese steak. I looked over the lunch/dinner menu and it has a lot of things that looked tasty as well.  It isn't a huge menu, but ok overall.2. The flavor of the food.  I had the breakfast quesadilla with steak and I was quite pleased.  You get a huge serving because they use the biggest tortillas ever and layer them instead of folding them in half.  The quesadilla was stuffed full of eggs and cheese with an ok share of steak sprinkled throughout.  It could have used a bit more steak, especially for the $5 surcharge to add it, but overall it was pretty good.  The tortillas were crispy and held together nicely, even being stuffed.  My hubby got the crunchy french toast.  It was a fun twist on your average french toast.  It didn't blow my socks off, but it was average.  My hubby really enjoyed it though, for whatever that matters.3.  The prices.  The prices all seemed to be a $1 or 2 too high on the breakfast menu.  The food was ok and with good sized servings, but it seemed a bit high, especially on the kids menu.  The kid's breakfast is $7 and the lunch/dinner kids menu is $10.  I guess they are going for a more upscale place with the prices, but they just didn't seem to fit.4. The interior is pretty, especially right now with the Christmas decoration up.  There were big wreaths along the wall, huge snowflakes everywhere, and even some mistletoe!  It had a rustic cantina look mixed with a bit of modern leather accents.  It really was nicely decorated.5. The service is on the mediocre side.  Everyone we talked too was super friendly and polite.  The problem is they were also absent most of the time and a bit on the ditzy side.  My hubby had a cup of coffee that was never refilled or even offered to get a refill, and the same went for my glass of water.  We were checked on about half way through our meal and when the check arrived, but that was it.  I don't think we are demanding, but a refill every now and then is more than reasonable in my book.So over all, John Cutter has some good things going for it, but it has some misses as well.  The food is tasty, but a bit pricey.  The interior is lovely, but the service level is hit or miss.  When you average everything out, I think 3 stars is a good average.The food is decent, but that is if you can actually get service once seated, and if you get service it comes with a lot of bad attitude!I'd recommend skipping this place!UPDATE:  sent an email to Kristy Morrison, General Manager over a week ago and received NO ACKNOWLEDGEMENT---speaks volumes to the service we received......my first experience with this venue was this evening, Sunday, which is 1/2 price steak night.  Understandably, the venue was packed.  NOT understandably was the fact that 2/3 of the food we ordered never came, including one of our steaks! The potatoes arrived after the steaks that did manage to find their way to our table but the salad, along with a steak and the asparagus sadly must have been lost in transit.  When we attempted to voice our concerns to the manager, (after having asked to speak with her multiple times) she finally arrived at our table immediately ordering one of our party to calm down and another to sit down ( he had simply gotten up to go look for her at the same time she was arriving) and advised that she had already heard our complaint from the server and wasn't interested in hearing it again.  She offered to remove the items not received from the bill (seriously? Does this not fall under the category of 'duh'?) and offered a gift certificate for the inconvenience of the inconsistent service. Not surprisingly, we never received the gift certificate. She then attempted to discount the incredibly unacceptable service by indicating a full house and new staff. Young lady, Management 101: YOUR staffing issues are NOT the problem of your patrons; accept accountability and attempt to accommodate your clientele with respect and dignity. The only reason I gave this venue 1 star is so that my review would be posted. If enough patrons complain about the abysmal service this venue obviously considers acceptable, perhaps actual management will review its process and make some adjustments. Not holding my breath...and I WILL be calling in the morning to report the incredibly disrespectful manner in which this obviously unskilled manager spoke to the 80 year old gentleman at our table. There is a plethora of amazing steak houses in Las Vegas; there is NO NEED to patronize this one.
Sports Deli=I come here every time I need a quick bite to eat at the Rio.  I usually just order up a 18 inch pizza. For about ~20 bucks you could feed 4-5 people, which is probably the best deal.  They also have sandwiches, salads, and all those regular deli type stuff.Best pizza I have ever had!!!! I'm not sure if it was because I was hungry but the pizza here was simply amazing!! They're open all night so it was nice when we were hungry at 4 in the morning. The workers were kind and helpful and we didn't get any rude looks when we were browsing their huge menu. They were patient with us even though it was 4am and we were a little drunk. A must have if you're ever in rio in the wee hours of the night and starving!This place was kind of hidden at first.  It is in the back/beside the Pho joint down in the bottom of the Rio Hotel/Casino.  After looking around at all the options of places to eat/drink, this was by thar the cheapest and fastest.  You could get salads, burgers, fries, sandwiches,  but most importantly slices of pizza.  The pizza slices were $5 and fast so that was the winner in my book.However, I suggest not ordering the garlic parm fries.  A friend of mine did and they just take their regular fries, dump way too much garlic powder on them, and dried parm.  BLAH.  That girl stuck for weeks.The salads here were great.  I suggest the greek salad.  I had many of them while there.
Inaka Sushi=We were pretty excited when the signs for Inaka Sushi were going up!  Finally, a sushi place in our neck of the woods and an all-you-can-eat one too, no less!  (Even better, the Husband was more than familiar with their first location after being a regular there.)Joining us was Melissa G. and another friend from SoCal who never gets AYCE sushi ever.  The dinner menu is $23.95, which is cheaper than some of the other sushi restaurants around.It was pretty empty on a Saturday night, but we figured it was because of the location more so.The menu selection is pretty standard with appetizers, nigiri, sushi rolls, and ice cream included in the AYCE.Appetizers: * Age Tofu (Deep Fried Tofu With Tempura Sauce) - Not quite like other restaurants where it sits in broth with bonito flakes.  Rather it's slices of soft tofu, lightly deep-fried, and tempura dipping sauce.* Shrimp Tempura - Standard, nothing special.* Green Mussels (Baked Mussels with Special Mayonnaise) - When we ordered this, we thought it was just regular baked green mussels.  It's more like "Dynamite" because of the mayo sauce and served in a scallop shell.* Yakitori (Grilled Chicken on Skewers with Teriyaki Sauce) - The Husband ate all of them, so I guess it was okay.* Seafood Ragoon (Deep-Fried Mixed Fish and Cream Cheese Wrapped in Wonton Skin) - It had a stronger salmon taste, and a dipping sauce would have been a good complement to it.* Miso Soup* Cucumber Salad (Sliced Cucumber with Sesame Dressing) Nigiri:* Amaebi (Sweet Shrimp) - Limit of one order of two per person.  It wasn't exactly what I called amaebi, the raw sweet shrimp.  It's a fake and bad substitute of two pieces of cooked shrimp sitting on rice.* Albacore (White Tuna)* Cajun Albacore* Hamachi* Garlic Tuna* Ikura (Salmon Roe)* Saba (Mackerel)* Sake (Salmon)* Hotate (Scallop) - Before ordering this one, we asked if the scallops were small ones mixed up with stuff or the larger variety.  The waitress confirmed it was the larger variety sliced in half and laid over the rice.  Well, when she brought it over, it was the former variety and not what we wanted.  It's a good thing we only requested one order since we ended up not eating it.  The waitress said it was because she was new and didn't know.* Uni (Sea Urchin) - Limit of one order of two per person.From the first bite of sushi, we knew that we weren't going to be happy.  The sushi rice was mushy and lacked the vinegar that makes it sushi rice.  Over and over again, I was getting less than impressed with their rice.  Blah.Sushi Rolls:* Salmon Skin Handroll* Spider Roll (Soft Shell Crab, Crab Salad, Masago & Eel Sauce) - Melissa G. wasn't too impressed with their version as they use a different batter so it comes out a lot darker and not as tasty.  It was alright.* Something Wrong Roll (Deep Fried Assorted Dish Fish Roll with Spicy Sauce) - It's tasty because it's deep fried and sits in a bed of mayonnaise spicy sauce.* Catepillar Roll (Fresh Water Eel, Cucumber & Topped with Avocado and Eel Sauce)* Kiss The Ass (Spicy Spider Topped with Spicy Crab) - I didn't even realize there was a soft shell crab inside because the crab concoction dominates the roll.Before we started ordering any of the rolls, I asked the waitress if they used Sriracha to make the hot sauce.  After much confusion, she finally went to the sushi chef to ask.  They were making a big deal out of it as if I was asking for the secret recipe to their spicy sauce when all I wanted to know is if they use it at all.  The final answer, yes.  I'm not a big fan of the stuff in my sushi.Dessert:* Green Tea, Plum, and Mango Ice Cream - Pretty good ice cream, and we all had our share.  Good stuff!Service could use some improvement.  With only two parties present, our waitress was too busy socializing than getting our order or refilling our tea and water.  Some orders were forgotten and needed some reminding.  The other waitress was a bit pushy about rushing me to clear a plate off as she waited so she could take it away.Overall, we were less than impressed and won't be going back.  It was just disappointing and screwing up the basic sushi rice is a bad sign.Damn it!!!! I was praying that this place would be at least "okay" since it's located near mountain's edge and there is nothing out here! I'm not exaggerating when I say the best part of the meal was when they notified me that after the second beer, the third would be free. They messed up rice... RICE! How the...? It was hard to even swallow the rice; it was too dry! Uncle Ben's minute made rice has treated me better. Also, no Uni, no toro despite it being pictured on an advertisement, and no super white OR and other fatty fish that could make up for it.I ate a lot of Nigiri on the AYCE menu and nothing really tasted fresh. I've eaten a lot of sushi in my day and the fish here was NOTICEABLY different IN A BAD WAY. I know. I know; all you can eat sushi is not the way to go if you want good sushi (under most circumstances), but this place was something else. I wasn't even going to try a roll after the nigiri, but I went with a half roll of something on the spicy side. The roll that they presented me with was something u might find in an Albertson's; wrapped up in plastic to take to go (maybe even worse). Let me emphasize: DAMN IT! I was really hoping, despite the not-so-great reviews that this place would be okay or at least bearable. I won't be back. Very simply: the place sucks. And that's too bad.Hopefully one day when I drive by in the future there will be a big banner that says "Under New Management" or something because they must know. They must know that they're setting standards that no one should be proud of. **sigh** the whole experience was disappointing. At least the free beer has helped mask my utter discontent with this place!!!! The service wasn't bad but who the hell cares when the food blows ass.I won't be back even tho it's seconds away. Womp. Womp. Womp.
Wendy's=This location is located in the classy around the area of the Camelback Colonnade area. With many fast food options and restaurants in the area this Wendy's location has seemed to do very well. The interior is updated and the location is always clean. The service is fast, friendly and a great bang for the buck. I think Wendy's has probably one of the best breakfast as far as options and quality food. The only issue I have with this location is my orders are not always up to par. My food thru the drive thru only has been served cold or prepared wrong. Meaning if I ask for no sauce they will still add the sauce. It happens all the time. Other then that everything else is all good.
Wayne's Sushi Bar=I just got home from an awesome time at Wayne's Sushi Bar. I can't believe we were here for 3 hours.Me n Lily D arrived here at 9pm. I came here after I had dinner at home. Lily was on a mission to satisfy my craving for some sashimi, since I had been craving some raw fish after seeing some pics she had posted.  What we ordered:-1 large Asahi-1 large Sapporo-2 large nigori sake + 1 on the house-1 hamachi jalapeno-1 ahi tuna salad-1 white tuna jalapeno-1 smoked bbq pork-1 toro nigiri-2 uni/quail egg/sake shootersWayne and his wife were great hosts/servers/chefs. I didn't expect to have such a great time tonight. They busted out the karaoke. Lily, Wayne, his wife, and some of the other guests showed is their vocal skills!! The fish was only about 4 stars, but the environment was 5 stars!! I made a comment to Wayne about giving me the slab of TORO and he gave us a plate of toro on the house!! The karaoke started towards the end of the night. Wayne, his wife, Lily D., and some of the other customers bust out their vocal skills on the mic. It was almost like being at a sushi bar in San Francisco!!
Villager=Ich gebe ja zu, dass das riesige "Free Wifi" Schild am Eingang nicht wenig an meiner Entscheidung für das sonst fast unscheinbare Villager beteiligt war. Es regnete in Strömen, ich hatte Hunger und etwas Zeit totzuschlagen. Meine Erwartungen waren irgendwo zwischen "Hauptsache warm" und "Essen, egal was" angesiedelt. Dementsprechend war ich beim Blick auf die Karte doch überrascht. Was zunächst nach buntem Küchenwirrwarr ausschaut, hat sich dann als echt toll überlegte Karte herausgestellt, die zugegeben nicht ganz in eine Schublade zu quetschen war. Ich entschied mich für die Springrolls mit Rotkohl und Walnüssen auf Rote-Bete-Apfel-Sauce. Wow, das war doch mal was anderes als das übliche Burger-Sandwich-Salat-Einerlei. Geschmeckt hat's super, mein Mittag war gerettet. Nur das Bezahlen hat dann ewig gedauert, obwohl ich direkt neben der Theke saß. Aber gut, geregnet hatte es immer noch und das Internetz sorgte für Kurzweile. Ich würde wiederkommen.
Bâton Rouge=WHY? WHY? WHY? I used to go to Baton Rouge for the ribs but after living in the US and getting a taste of wood smoked ribs, I was done with utilitarian ribs. This week I went back since there's a Baton Rouge right outside the office with the team. I had forgotten the insane prices at this restaurant for straight a no frills trying to be everything to everyone menu. One shouldn't have to remortgage his home to eat out at lunch.That being said, it was an office lunch and I was going. This Baton Rouge also has a very nice terrace to eat outside and enjoy the nice summer weather and make you forget you are downtown. The service is acceptable but they fail to distinguish between lunch service and evening service. If your restaurant is between two large corporate glass towers, you know your lunch crowd is a working crowd that doesn't always have time for a long lunch. On to the food...I ordered the NY steak which is a beautiful cut of meat and also easily prepared. The fat alone can flavor it and it doesn't need much more than some spices. So done deal right? You would be SOOOOOOOOOOOO WRONG. When I got my steak just from the sear marks I could tell that this steak had been constantly thrown around the grill. From the way the fat strip was curling off the meat I could tell the steak had not finished thawing before being grilled - which rendered the meat tasteless. There were no salts, peppers or spices. EPIC FAIL. The potato, and I'm only speculating, tasted like last night's oven baked potato because it was so dry and bland that even the quarter of a cup of sour cream, cheese and bacon dressing on it couldn't save this potato, which also had no seasoning. No third party veggies were made available. Louisiana touch, my ass. Half an ear of corn would have been a nice southern touch with my steak. But there's NOTHING Southern or Cajun on their menu.I'll blame consumers for this disaster in my plate. Why? Because no one ever bitches and complains about their bad food quality they are being served in restaurants, especially for a 38$ NY steak. Like I said to my colleague and former chef, I can make a 5 dollar strip loin from a super-market into a feast you'll think I got from a pro butcher. I cringe that a restaurant cook can't have steaks at room temperature ready for lunch time - if your boss is too much of a cheap bastard to buy it fresh - and season them appropriately to taste and for the sake of all that is good in life when you drop a steak on a grill, the next time you touch it is to flip it and after that to remove it - stop paddling and twiddling the meat, you will ruin it. Same for a potato. If you can't bake a fucking potato... GO HOME. What's so hard with crusting it with olive oil and coarse salt and make the tatter explode with extra flavor?Why am I bitching? Cause that plate cost me 38$ plus tip and all I got was a badly prepped steak and an old dry potato. For 30$ I made all 3 Rib-Eyes, Duck Sausage, Beef Ribs and potatoes at home and we foodgasmed for hours. For a single plate at 38$ plus tip, I'm expecting some added value to the experience, not leftovers. What a total complete ripoff to be charged so much dinero for such lack of care and passion. Again another establishment that values form over function. I'd rather eat at a shack that serves me great awesome tasting food in a paper plate than go to an upscale looking restaurant made for corporate power-lunchers but serves me barely edible badly prepared  low quality products.A lame 1 outta 5 stars
Marven's Restaurant=Been coming here for years and it never seems to lessen in quality or service. The decor used to be a lot tackier with the stuffed bear, moose and horse heads but has calmed down considerably over the years (to my dismay!). The servers are prompt and really friendly- the type of server where when it comes to tip, you open up your wallet and say "take all the monies!"We were a party of four and ordered two gyro plates (each has two pitas), a calimari, and a tzaziki. So. Much. Food. The plates are crazy packed with fries, rice, the gyros, a massive salad with your feta, olive and peppers. It's perfect for two people, but an ordeal for one. We ordered the larger calimari to share and again, way more was given than what was needed to feed four people. They were crisp and fresh, super light, and totally hit the spot. The only criticism is that the smaller pieces were slightly overdone, as it took on a more rubbery texture. But that could just be me trying to be an amateur food critic.Just go-- and get ready to roll out of this place. Or if you're normal, you'll limit yourself and ask for a takeout box.Marven's is a pretty old school traditional place, a family sort of restaurant. They don't take reservations and there is usually a line out the door. The portions are enormous and food is very consistent and reliable. And I guarantee that you have never seen a bigger portion of calamari in your life. Note that the calamari does not automatically come with tzatziki so you need to order this separately. Overall Marven's is a pretty solid place, however it is not particularly inexpensive and the line ups are long and I'm convinced that it is really worth all this. However, they do do takeout which is a good option if you need to get your calamari fix.
Queue de Cheval=One of the Montreal's most well known steakhouses became the site of our most epic dinner during my friend's bachelor party weekend. In the midst of planning for the dinner, there was a tossup decision between this place and cross town rival Gibby's (http://www.yelp.ca/biz/gibbys-restaurant-montreal). The deliberation ended with Queue de Cheval for one thing: amazing service. From the phone reservation to greeting us at the door to the end of the meal, they did one heck of a job in accommodating our party of 12 hungry men.From the outside into the lobby, it's easy to see how beautiful this restaurant really is. In true steakhouse fashion, there are various cuts of meat from all parts of the world on display, something a true meat connoisseur can surely appreciate. We were able to get a spot on the second floor facing the street and the restaurant was like many other upscale steakhouses: trendy decor, well dressed patrons and wait staff, a lively ambiance just buzzing with activity. Generally speaking, the food always takes precedence in any restaurant but in places like this, service is of the utmost importance. The wait staff was quick and handled everything with ease, we almost never had to ask for anything as water was filled quickly, bread was refilled automatically, and there was never any attitude. Our main waiter was sharp, humorous, and extremely knowledgeable about virtually every item on the menu and was able to make some killer recommendations for drinks and food. We decided to pass on their appetizers, a majority of which would sully our carnivorous appetite for the one thing we came for - steak. Almost all of us were sold on the 20oz Lou's Cut ($54), which is the place's most popular steak.Along with the steak we ordered multiple sides of creamed corn ($12), truffle and parmesan fries ($7), garlic mashed potatoes ($5), along with a heaping of steak sauces: veal and truffle reduction ($6), cognac peppercorn ($6), and a cabernet sauvignon demi glace ($6) and staring at us was a hell of a meal.Everything was fantastic. The creaminess of the garlic mash, coupled by the delicious sauteed garlic spinach was melt in your mouth good. There were multiple foodgasms galore over the Lou's Cut, a hearty Colorado imported hunk of steak heaven in it's medium rare glory, juicy and went great with everything. The steak sauces weren't even all that necessary, but once added, there was no going back. Every bite was enhanced, the flavors were so rich, it was just the perfect amount of food; life was suddenly perfect.   Along with the Australian red and whites we sipped throughout the night, including 4 orders every side and a Lou's cut, the price we paid (sans the bachelor of course) was a very reasonable $82 per person. The conversation was as excellent as the food which was stellar as the service. Steakhouses might feel a tad more expensive in Montreal, mainly due to the importing of all of the meat, but when in town, this is one of the best places for steak period.Here's a parting thought for everyone: http://www.yelp.ca/biz_photos/Ek4sVcvmACWp8P1yizjwZg?select=NCkeuXRvI3XEOftyy2x7EQQuelle dommage... as the French would say.  Like watching a gorgeous souffle collapse before your eyes, this was the experience at Queue De Cheval.   Brace yourselves.A business partner in Montreal wanted to take some colleagues and me to dinner after a particularly successful event we co-sponsored.  He was quite proud to take us to this steakhouse proclaiming it to be the best steak in the city.  We walked in hungry and wide-eyed, the smell of the cigar bar pleasantly (really) entering the lobby/butcher shop in the front of the restaurant.The first thing I took note of was the meat case that sold filet mignon for $79/lb.  Outback steakhouse this is not.We were seated upstairs.  The restaurant seemed relatively empty for 9pm on a Friday night, so we got a very nice table by the front window overlooking the bronze horse statue (queue de cheval is French for The Horse's Tail after all).  The decor and ambiance is beautifully done.  Acres of rich woods.  'Bookcases' piled to the ceiling with wine bottles.  Artwork adorned the walls that befit the restaurant's name.  The centerpiece is a huge stainless steel funnel that encompasses the cast-iron grill on the main floor.  A spiral staircase encircles this chimney to get you to the dimly lit, warm and rustic second floor.Our pleasant waiter handed us our menus and then brought our first round of drinks.  He went on to explain the steaks on the menu like any other high end steakhouse.  They have corn fed beef from Colorado, grass fed beef from Nebraska and 'kobe' beef from Australia.  Kobe can only be from Japan, so I was a little suspicious.  He showed us several cuts of beef on a platter as well as what can only be described as a mermaid tail.  Jamaican lobster tails that were 2lbs on their own.  They also have Maine lobsters starting at 3.5lbs and going up to 6.  Price of entry for these?  $65/lb.Enjoying our beers, our garcon came back and took our orders.  The table ordered 3 Canadian filet mignons ($38) while I ordered a grass fed, bone on NY Strip ($53).  At the waiter's behest, we ordered 3 sides for the table - Asparagus, garlic mashed potatoes and sauteed mushrooms.  The sides were from $12 to $15 each.Standing on ceremony, Pablo brought us our uncooked steaks to look at, telling us they would be served to us in about 30 minutes.  Yep, they were steaks.  Thanks bro.Finally, our food arrived.  A steak on a plate, adorned with nothing but a split bulb of roasted garlic.  Nothing more.  Here is where things went horribly, horribly wrong (well, relatively - no one died).  I cut, nay, SAWED into my steak.  I was not entirely impressed with how difficult it was to get through this meat.  At first I thought it was overcooked, but it just turned out to be tough.  More shocking were when the sides arrived.  The asparagus plate held 8 small spears.  The garlic mashed came in a small cast-iron urn holding perhaps two small servings and lastly a cup of wet looking mushrooms.  I took my two allotted spears of asparagus and meager tablespoons of potatoes.  The asparagus was simply grilled.  TOO simply grilled.  Unseasoned, bland, and shockingly overcooked.  At $2 a spear, pretty ridiculous.  The potatoes were genuinely good.  The best thing on my plate.  And that's sad.  I didn't have any mushrooms as they just didn't appeal to me.  I continued to fight through my steak.  The flavor was fine having been cooked to my requested medium-rare.  However, It was woefully underseasoned and I added salt.  But overall, it was tough, gristly and disappointing.  If I were paying for the meal, I would have sent it back.  I probably would have sent this steak back at a diner.  I bit my tongue and smiled as I did not want to embarrass my host and his restaurant choice.We left after coffee and this morning, my colleagues and I had breakfast and discussed the previous night's meal.  I was glad to find I was not the only one wholly dissatisfied with their food.  I live in NY and have been to many a high end steak house there and elsewhere.  They're all better.  Hell, The Keg in Old Montreal was much better.  I can fire a much more mouth watering steak from Whole Foods in my own backyard.  Queue de Cheval seems to rest on pomp and circumstance, and sky high prices.  It lacked substance entirely.  I think some people will brainwash themselves to think they are eating amazing food just because the price is inflated.  They should rename it The Horse's Ass.  I've given them a single star.  A reasonably priced restaurant with the same quality food, I would have given two.  If you want to feel like a rock star, get a steak dinner at The Keg and then spend the money you would have squandered getting bottle service at one of the swank clubs nearby.I had been to the Queue de Cheval a couple of times several years ago when they were located on Rene-Levesque, and although I never ranked it among the best steak houses I've eaten at, it was always very good.This weekend, a group of friends and I tried it again (it is temporarily located inside the tacky nightclub, 1234 on de la Montagne) and I regret to say that it was one of the WORST meals I have had in a restaurant in a very long time.If I explained everything that went wrong, this review would be 15 paragraphs, so I'll keep it as short as possible: the meals came out at different times (the last person was literally served 30 minutes before the first), the food was not good (bland, overcooked steak, dry & tasteless lobster carpaccio), the service staff was not only disorganized but arrogant, and to top it all off, they seated us next to the nightclub entrance and opened the velour curtains at 10:00 pm, at which time we were freezing from the draft, annoyed by the cheezy eurotrash, and bothered by the scantily-clad 19 year old girls shoving their way into the club.The most unbelievable part of it all was when we complained to the manager. He called the owner to ask him what to do, and the owner who passed on the following message to our table: "I don't care if they didn't like it, tell them to never come eat here again."This restaurant is NO LONGER a top-tier steakhouse. What it is now is a hugely overpriced restaurant in a nightclub with sub-par food. Horrible.
FuNuGyz Sports Grill=I had visions of the ghost of Harry Caray dancing in my brain, the day had been consumed with downers and baseball, cartoon drunks hyped on the American dream, we were chasing it where it lay somewhere buried in the heart of the west side, strip malls and freeways. It was a glorious windy day for an LA Dodgers versus the DBacks spring training game at the former's stadium in Glendale. Drunk and raving at the equally rabid dodgers fans there was no time to eat, only to refuel on beer and hatred, and after beating them for 8 straight innings we both decided that it was high time to leave our seats and quest for food.  After a quick jaunt down the freeway, and at my friend's recommendation we sought out Fannooogieez (true spelling). We stumbled out of my friends cluttered Saturn, smoke billowing out of the interior ala Cheech/Chong and practically crawled inside. The place is your standard garden variety family friendly sort of westside sports bar. There were a cluster of black motorcycles parked on the sidewalk, and an empty patio as we sauntered up to the entrance, inside hunkered numerous tables sparsley populated with slavering sports fans eyes glued to the various television screen idols. I stared numbly and followed inside to a large booth and plopped down exhuastedly. It took a while but eventually our lackadaisical server came around, but in that interim that seemed like an eternity to my ravenous stomach, we had occupied ourselves with a trivia game playing to no one in particular on one of the tube screens, until another player signed in and started kicking our asses. We were starting to feel pretty smug about our ability until "Brady" signed in. Scanning the bar, covertly mind you, we couldnt find any other players. We focused on the game, getting progressivley behind, and more vociferous. There seemed to be an inverse relationship between our trivia score and our bar tab, one went up, the other went down. Finally I couldn't take being emasculated by this repugnant Brady any longer, I feigned a cigarette break (our score so far behind any more seemed..well..trivial). As I stood up and stretched I scanned the bar, each face intently, I gave the bar an "occular pat down" if you will and successively cleared each individual, and then it dawned on me. Brady was no mere mortal, we were competing against the AI itself. This was realized after about 3 rounds and over an hour or so of furitvely stealing glances at our fellow patrons suspiciously. I felt foolish, but consoled myself with the places decidedly good chicken wings. In the end, all that mattered was that I knew in my heart and soul, that if the moon were made of a plate of barbecued chicken wings I would eat it, heck I'd go back for seconds!
1855 Saloon and Grill=So the saloon was pops' idea, and the sad thing is it is a really good looking restaurant - gorgeous interior, great pictures from the 18 and early 1900's, a wood fired grill, and a great atmosphere.  But it is all show and no substance.1855 has no soul. I've been here three times now and each time left me disappointed.  The first time I ordered Bruschetta and they served it to me first before telling me they were unable to toast it because their grill was down.  It was not good.  The second time I was at 1855 I ordered the Reuben and it may have been good except the toast they served it on was soggy on the bottom, like it had been sitting for a while before being served.  Plus no thousand island dressing, and that might as well be a crime where I come from.  Pops wasn't happy with his Panini, and I gotta say it didn't even look appetizing.. another crime in my book.  A new lead cook is in order.  Possibly stricter adherence to food ethics.  1855 is a mighty good looking restaurant with nothing to offer once the lust is gone.  Don't you just hate that?We live in CG and used to come here often. Their food and service are very inconsistent. I have had excellent meals and not so excellent meals. Same with the service.I have had their steak with the stuffed shrimp on top and it was sensational! Their wood fire pizza is also delicious! Burgers are good too. Their fried pickles are delish but the breeding falls off. We ordered their app sampler once and that was not good at all. It was cold and tasted very processed, definitely frozen. Service is also hit or miss. Our table service has always been good. Bar service is a little different. They have one male bartender that is extremely arrogant and seems to be "above it all". He acts as if he could care less, injects himself into conversations and can be condescending. He does however make great drinks... When he's not chatting up the waitstaff or the attractive single women. That being said, I have never had terrible service or a bad meal here. I will be back. Depending on the night you could have three stars or five stars.Just left after waiting 15 minutes for a server that never came. We were seated outside. Saw a hostess after 15 min and said our server never came. Said she would check on it. One minute later the table that had been sat 15 min after us had their order taken. We waited a few more minutes and decided to leave. We went to the hostess stand and asked for a manager just so they knew what would happen. When the manager came we told her what happened. She said sorry and it must have been a shift change issue. She didn't try to get us to stay and didn't seem to care at all.Very disappointing. The food that we saw coming out looked good but we'll never know. We had been wanting to try this place for awhile after stopping in for a drink awhile ago when there was live music. Sadly I will never come back and I will make sure to tell people not to try it either.
Pizza Il Focolaio=Nice crust. Not too thin, not heavy. A paper placemat menu with 70 pizza options (somehow this already makes me love you). All the ones I've tried are fresh and the combinations tasty. Sort of an old Italian Quebecois family diner vibe with big pitchers, dignified but not fancy. They'll treat you right and fill you up and possibly pass on some life advice with the take-out menu. Come as you are.If the weather is fair and you sit in the patio you'll have one of the homiest views of downtown Montreal, looking out on Phillips Square, just off the press of St Catherine's. A lovely mellow old school place for pizza pie.Most everyone loves great pizza but can't always agree what that is.  Il Focolaio meets most of my basic pizza must haves.Crust that leans to the thin side but retains some thickness and texture.Quality ingredients and a balance of sauce. Over 50 choices from anchovies to escargot Crisp, fresh and lightly dressed salads large enough for two as an accompanimentQuickly cooked in a wood fired oven. A wine list that is fairly priced by the glass or bottleIn addition Il Focolaio has waiters that know what they are doing and are eager to accommodate their customers.It can get a little to noisy inside but when everyone is talking about the great food - that's to be expected.
Finz Raw Bar and Grill=Been here when it was Vinnie's, but finally got around to coming back to try it under its new name:  Finz.  Parking is sort of a nightmare depending on what night you go on.  This particular night, it wasn't so much busy, it's just that the people the parked before did not make an effort to stay in their spaces.  In a tight parking lot, this is detrimental.  We did manage to find a space.Upon walking in, we were warmly greeted and seated right away.  They were having trivia on a Tuesday night.  It was almost halfway in so we figured it had started pretty early (7 or 7:30).I honestly couldn't remember what the Vinnie's dining room setup looked like, but the current Finz set up was cozy and casual.  The menu was pretty extensive - took a while to read through, but had lots of options.  You can get anything from a decently priced sandwich to a sizable seafood dinner (with items at market prices).There was a yelp check-in special where we got 6 free wings.  Our waitress was super nice and gave them to us... a little while later, the manager wanted to see my phone, but no problems.It was Shrimp night on Tuesdays so I got a basket.  They were breaded nicely and not too greasy.... they came with a tartar dipping sauce and I chose a baked potato as my side.  I was pretty satisfied with my meal and would come back to order it again.  The wings we got were good - decided to try the parmesan garlic wings.  Light on the sauce (in a good way) they proved to be tasty - I'm sure the other flavors probably would have had more kick to them, but they were cooked nicely.Overall, Finz gets a solid 4 from me.  Matthews is lucky to have a place like this that is centrally located and easy to get to.
Wild Wing Cafe=I have been to the WW in Asheville I Guess more than 30 times always great food service and drinks. BUT... there is something about The WW At this location and one other it seems like it must be KFC.     IT all started about 230pm I guess I had passed by this location a few times but, decided to stop. They had a all u can eat wing and soup I think (I am trying to forget). FIRST THE SERVER DID NOT HAVE A CLUE. So I get to the buffet line 4 dried out wings and no soup. I stopped 2 employees and asked about the food they looked at me like I was from MARS...I and I guess 4 people waited for wings nothing came out. I LEFT 3 dollars on the table for the tea and was out of there. I CALLED THE PLACE a few moments later and spoke with a bartender who sounded like he was on crack that said he was 'in charge right now"HE kept repeating over and over what I was saying so there must have been some sort of medication... issue so I hung up.          I called their Corp office and spoke with "David" who said he was a district manager he said the bartender should not have been in charge and laughed about it   ????After he tried to sweep it under the rug he invited me to another location and told me it would be better and after about 3 weeks sent me a letter with a gift card..         So after about a month I was stuck in traffic pulled off and decided to give then one more chance... NOT goin to go into the terrible service while there you can message me if anyone wants details.. Anyway got wings to go got home opened the bag and a ROACH CRAWLED OUT DAMM. !!!!!! I called the CORP GUY and he said there is no bugs in that store...I ASKED HIM THEN WHAT JUST CRAWLED OUT A CHICKEN WING? Again he invited me to the location on Ardslye his FLAGSHIP LOCATION NOT ANY BETTER I GAVE UP ON WILD WINGS IN THIS AREA
Filibertos Mexican Food=I had to join Yelp just so that I could write this review. It's important to me to warn the people about Filibertos just West of Dobson on Southern. I drove through yesterday and asked about the special. It was two beef tacos with a drink for $2.99. Who could resist? I thought they must be small tacos so I also tacked on a carne asada taco. Oh, my tummy protests even now. I consumed the food items at 3:30pm and at 6pm began to feel really uncomfortable. I had to take a walk. Within four hours, I was retching and squirting from both ends at the same time. Food poisoning? I say YES. Drive thru with extreme caution. Note: I've eaten at Filiberto's on Broadway by Hardy many times and have never gotten sick... maybe a little discomfort but never the double projectile.
Paradise Bakery & Cafe=I had never, ever been recognized because of Yelp...until a few days ago!I was frankly concerned that the first time someone recognized me because of Yelp, it would be in connection with one of my less "flattering" reviews.And I take very seriously, the old adage "never mess with people that prepare and handle your food"!So I was surprised and delighted (and more than little relieved) that my "first time" was with Jennifer, at this Paradise Bakery outpost!Jennifer was sweet and friendly, she was even complimentary about my humble attempts to create interesting reviews!I not only appreciate her reading my little stories, I really appreciated her saying "Hi"!The Beautiful Carin and I used to frequent this PB when we lived in Scottsdale Mountain, but I hadn't been here in some time.We would have a croissant or a muffin and drink refill after refill of PB's very good coffee, read our Sunday papers and plot and plan the week ahead.It was and is a great spot to just hang out!One of my clients suggested it as a place to meet...and since they have pretty decent baked goodies, good coffee, free wifi and, of course, Jennifer (and a lot of nice people like Jennifer helping you at PB), I said "why not".Have you noticed that almost no one (including me, BTW) meets at their offices anymore...or at least rarely?Out of 8 client meetings in Phoenix this week, 3 were at an office...the rest took place at a coffee shop, or a restaurant, or on a park bench late at night (OK, I'm kidding about that last one...probably).This location is my favorite of all the PB's (and judging from my PB Frequent Flyer Card, I have clearly been to nearly all of them, so I think I'm qualified to judge).Drop by, grab a Lemon Poppyseed Muffin (unless you have a drug test scheduled for later in the day), a bottomless cup of coffee, fire up the iPad and make this place your office away from the office.And say "Hi" to my new friend, Jennifer!
Ah-So Sushi & Steak=The wife and I went here for a New Years dinner for two... it's pretty much the only fine dining place in Goodyear outside of the Wigwam (and they only had NYE dinners that night). I feel bad that the company around us got more of our attention then the chef at the table but it defiantly was an enjoyable experience. The price point is average for Teppanyaki dinner and the service here is top notch. I had no issues on my order or anything simple like refills or cleanliness. The sushi was well crafted and the steak and chicken combo with fried rice was quite tasty. Probably the best fried rice I have had in the valley of the sun. My wife enjoyed her Mai Tai's and dish as well. This is a nice place to have a unique date night and I would suggest that yelper's give it a try.
Victor & Carina Contini Ristorante=Repeat after me: 'chen-toh-tray'. Accent the first and third syllables. That seems to roughly be the pronunciation for this venue. It shouldn't have been to difficult to realize that it's Italian for 'one hundred three', the street address here. Duh. Hey - I never said I wasn't dense.A shockingly sun-drenched Friday morning found me sitting here, surrounded by various marketers and techies, slurping on a big ol' mug of steaming Americano, and later wolfing down a bacon focaccia.Considering our party took up one massive rectangular table, then later metastasized to another smaller table or two, the staff was considerably patient and accommodating. Not only that, since #EdCM was ostensibly a networking event, everyone traded seats frequently, yet our final bill came out perfectly - no mystery additions and no missing items.While the most I can report regarding my food was that it was satisfying (because it was)... I'd suggest that the most noteworthy aspects of this joint are the airy high ceilings, the enormous white pillars that stretch from floor to ceiling, and the free wi-fi. I realize the latter isn't an architectural design element, but it might as well be. To me, it's no weirder asking, "Hey, does that place have a roof?" than, say, "So, does that business have free interwebz?"And to answer your unspoken question, no... I am -not- a cyborg. I just play one on TV.*--* This is a patent lie. I've only played myself on TV here and there. And once on a Margaret Cho DVD. Truth.
Hong Kong Bistro=2.55 StarsHong Kong Bistro is one of those restaurants that is nearby and I thought I had already reviewed it.They are a pretty basic Chinese restaurant with decor one step above the typical hole in the wall joint.Expect average quality and prices, no more, no less.The people here are friendly.  I have nothing else to say about Hong Kong Bistro and you may consider that a reflection of my experience here as much as anything else.
Sushi Roku=I wanted so badly to hate this place. You have no idea. And this doesn't come from a place of hate in my heart. I don't hate "Scottsdale." The concept. The place. Or the people.Ani Di Franco says "If I were you, you're exactly who I'd be..."So if I was both a city and an undeniable DB (which are equally possible coexisting phenomena considering my paunch and treatment of other humans at large), I could indeed be Scottsdale. I could represent everything about it. But instead, some rich ladies and gentlemen, developers and career hype-hawkers no doubt, decided to build a representation on Camelback Rd so I could go on just being me, Dally G. Scottlas, Atlas' retard cousin, I am not. No, I did not just use that word.  But, as I said, I don't hate it. I do hate hype. I do hate, kind of with all my heart, the fucking dumb asses who stand in line for video game systems, Starwars movies, and iPhones. So the 2000+ people who showed up at the pool at the W this weekend are the unjustifiably more socially acceptable versions of the 3 week line-standing uberdorks. I know I'm making a lot of friends here.  So when I arrived at Sushi Roku for a "press junket," I was like, I already hate this place. Just because I'm a judgmental asshole. And I wasn't greeted by a TOTAL FUCKING TOOL. By that I mean, some fucking asshole in a horrible, horrible tie who later introduced himself as an assistant GM, would not fucking acknowledge my presence as I'm leaning on the podium. Dude, the people at the front are more important than the famous chefs and stingray skin place settings! Get a fucking clue douche-nozzle! ARG! It wasn't until the main attraction arrived and took the bull by the horns that we were able to break into his extraordinarily minuscule external sphere of recognition or comprehension. Ok, so I have no idea what a press junket is... But I'm calling it that because it makes me sound like a pimp. And I need more of that in my life. But it was a night for press people from around town to come and check it out and get everything comped and interact superficially because they all seem to hate/judge each other. Who can blame them, really. And it was fucking marvelous. I loved the place. As a vegetarian on a meaty night, they hooked my skanky ass up. I had a breath-taking eggplant dish. Some tofu variety platter that would probably be about $15 I imagine, which was good but I would have to know the price before I could recommend it. I had a mushroom tofu steak and a fairly delish dessert. It was all very good. The seaweed salad was good but loud. Yes, very loud in my head. Our waiter, while it seemed that he had never worked in the service industry before, was genuinely nice and totally helpful with my surely annoying veggieness. We got a pseudo sneak peek of the pool area during a party that was going on. I didn't quite understand why it was so hush hush when there was already a huge party going on but whatever. The place is fucking rad. Bring a date there. Expect him/her to put out. Not because he'll/she'll feel obligated but because everything is sexier there. It's just totally amazing. The people walking around the rest property were as snobby as you'd expect and yes, they are judging you. But everyone should check this place out once. I guess this is sort of a review of my experience at the W as well. You'll probably live. Check it out.I've always felt there are two items that are consistent indicators of the overall quality of a sushi restaurant... saba or uni. I took the saba test and Sushi Roku got low marks. The fishier the saba generally the less awesome your sushi meal will be and sure enough, my saba was pretty fishy and the overall meal was edible, but not stellar. Granted I was eating sushi in landlocked Scottsdale, so perhaps the joke is on me. Alas I was tired from my travels and was in desperate need of food, so I can't say I thought about my dining decision before going in. The interior is pretty sleek (as is the decor of the whole hotel) so I'd say it'd still be a fun spot for a date. Our server was pretty cool too. Final word: If you're staying in the hotel, don't feel like branching out, and have no price sensitivity, it's fine.OK so where do I start first off the place looks cool and has a really truly awesome assortment of food on the menu. Plenty to choose from including carpoccios which are my fav. I ordered the tuna carpaccio = the fish was sliced too thick and had what tasted like a salty bottle bought ponzu. Dont order this if you want carpaccio Yellowtail carpaccio = delicious sliced thin and had the oils and herbs perfect. A good size too. Miso soup = the same as everywhere else The Katana roll = dude this thing is freaking amazing but for 16 bucks I dont know soo good though. some beef wrapped in asparagus= soo bad I took it back Spicy Tuna was over minced like mush All in all the meal was good but for 70 bucks I left hungry and pissed The waiter was soo weird and creepy. I was there with my gf and a friend and he asked my friend if she was having a rough night, WTF!!! Dont ask a girl if she was having a rough night. Might as well said you look like shit. So weird. Oh and the fact he only talked to my gf when he was addressing any of us. Talking to him was like pulling teeth soo damn weird. I did go back a second time and had good food and a waitress with a name with like all syllables. I wish I could remember it because she really is the bestThe ambience is a feast for the eyes and for the touch, this much is true, but one is paying a very high price for this exclusivity.  While I liked waiting in the lobby- couldn't sit at the sushi counter until it was open for dinner service at 5:30p- I did notice that for a venue that strives to project a life of luxury, housekeeping hadn't come by to clean food debris off of the coffee table (closest to the sushi restaurant's host desk).  Not even when a rep came by to alert me to a bar menu sitting on the table and asked me if I had wanted anything from the bar- she had to have noticed the mess?!I ordered a $9.50 spider roll (soft-shelled crab), a $10 veggie tempura app, and a $19 baked lobster roll, all priced at 50% for one week during their 1-year anniversary.  They're all good, and factoring in the ostentatious surroundings, I'd pay $9.50 for the soft-shelled crab roll, but I'd put my foot down on the other two.  50% maybe, but $19 for a five-piece lobster roll?  Yes, it was very tasty, and yes, the cream sauce was orgasmic, but for $19, I expect moments from the restaurant scenes of "The Ugly Truth" or "When Harry Met Sally," take your pick.If you've money to burn or have someone else paying for the bill, then this is your sushi stop near Old Town Scottsdale.Located in the W Hotel in Old Town Scottsdale, this hipster hangout is always busy.  I recommend a reservation if you're planning to dine here.  The Better Half and I drop in here from time to time.  Since I don't eat Sushi, I order:Ji-Dori Chicken Skewers withTeriyaki Sauce - $10http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/DwP10iEz5LGf3fhcVQZm0Q?select=x_60nAIMvJX9k_s9HAPiOAFilet Mignon wrapped Asparagus with Soy Mirin Sauce - $15http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/DwP10iEz5LGf3fhcVQZm0Q?select=19cHPtx8ahwZTPC5xIARFQhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/DwP10iEz5LGf3fhcVQZm0Q?select=_4XhXTuYKQnypHmylm-mQgAnd for Dessert, a warm Chocolate Cake...yum!http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/DwP10iEz5LGf3fhcVQZm0Q?select=KoyBtoSTBrhM2dLD8zs_PAhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/DwP10iEz5LGf3fhcVQZm0Q?select=iKBiwthdGtENIqWfGK1V1AThe Chicken Skewers are very tasty.  The Teriyaki Sauce they are glazed are sweet and have the right amount of "sour" kick to it to balance the flavor.  The Filet Mignon wrapped Asparagus is awesome...the Filet is tender and juicy and the Asparagus compliments it well.  Of course, the Chocolate Cake dessert is a nice ending for the meal.The service can be a bit slow at times, depends on the server.  Generally speaking, it's pretty good considering how busy they are.The people watching here is pretty good...watching all of the hipsters is hilarious.Return Factor - 93%Sushi Roku used to be our favorite sushi restaurant in the area. We've been here to celebrate an anniversary, a birthday, and fun date nights whenever we got the craving for sushi. Unfortunately, the quality seems to have declined in the past year. Our most recent experience left a bad taste in our mouth and I don't think we'll be returning any time soon.We came here on a Friday night before the Christmas holiday and were surprised the restaurant was playing such loud club music. We joked that we felt we were eating on the dance floor. The ambiance just wasn't as inviting or classy as it was previously. Things went downhill from here.. The Katana Roll was not as flavorful as it has been in the past and the presentation was different. For a $17 "specialty sushi roll" we were expecting something special and were left quite disappointed.The Caterpillar Roll was also not as good as it has been in the past. I could've sworn that this inside out roll used to include crab meat inside, but our server said that I must be thinking of their Dragon Roll. I highly doubt it because the Dragon Roll isn't even on the menu. In any case, this roll was also quite disappointing and definitely not worth the hefty $16 price. The roll had a tiny piece of unagi inside, which was cold rather than hot and freshly cooked. All in all, quite disappointing and sad that the quality of this once 5 star place has declined to the point that I can't rate it higher than 3 stars.
Yokoso Japanese Steakhouse=Terrible! My first and last visit here ever. Let's start with the fact that it was my friend's birthday. It was my husband and me, my bff and her husband. Our main plan for the evening was to head to Sing-Sing. Due to getting a late start, we decided to stop here for dinner. It was Saturday night after 8pm so not very busy. We were seated outside quickly. Then we waited. And waited. A waitress passed our table 4 or 5 times without a word.After at least five minutes, the hostess came outside and said that our waiter would be with us shortly, but she could get our drinks. It took her several minutes to bring out all of the drinks, since she didn't bring them all out together. And I still had to ask for my drink, because she forgot. There is some type of "birthday special" which inclues $15 off of a dinner, free cake, and some type of "sparker" and "popper" celebration. And a free gift...."while supplies last", whatever that means. This is good one week prior or after your actual birthday....pending valid ID. Although the menu also says not valid on Saturdays or holidays, my friend inquires anyways, since it is not at all busy. The hostess says that they will honor the birthday special and that the manager "is really cool and will be fine with it". Fine. Waiter Joe finally arrives....dude is clueless. My friend's husband and I get hibachi dinners and my husband and friend get sushi platters. He asks what type of salad dressing we want....ginger or vinegar and oil. All four of us say vinegar and oil, all four come out with ginger. We have to ask the waiter several times for obvious things - Silverware and Napkins, More Drinks, To Take Plates Off Of The Table. You know, things that should come as common knowledge to wait staff.When our meals come, he brings out one plate of sushi and seems confused, stating that they put all of the sushi on one plate.....uh no. We tell him there should be two plates. I mean, two people ordered two separate meals?! He fixes it and returns. Has no idea whose order goes to who....ugh. At the end of the meal, Joe messes up our checks, putting things my friends ordered on our check. Again, we have to wait for this to get fixed. The worst part is that they automatically put 20% gratuity on the bill. I would not have left this dude a dollar if I had the choice. We waited several minutes to get our change. I actually had to go up to the bar and ask a bartender to find my waiter. Joe obviously cannot count either, he gave us $1.50 too much in change. I figured it could come out of his tip....Here's the kicker....my friend gets none of this "birthday special"...no free cake, no $15 off, nothing. We inquire with Joe, who is still clueless. He has the manager, Jay, come out. My friend explains that, yes, we understand that it is Saturday, however the hostess said that it would be fine. Jay blabbers something about it being Saturday, and they try to exclude Saturdays to drum up business other, less busy days. We state, they are not busy at the moment. And this free cake thing means apparently, according to the manager, that if you bring your own cake, they won't charge you to plate it. His explanation for the ambiguous script on the menu? "The Japanese can't explain things well". Oh, okay. He also says that the birthday special requires four meals to be purchased. Well, there is four of us, we say. He says, no....since they were on separate checks. Jay also says that this is "up the manager's discretion", but still will not give her the discount.My friend says, "Okay that's fine. We just won't be returning". the manager's response is...."Have a nice night" and Walks Away! I cannot even comment on the food....which was fine - not great not terrible - because there were so many other things to distract from the experience. This should have been a nice relaxing dinner with friends and it was blah blah blah. I won't speak for the others (although I know their thoughts), but I feel cheated. One of the worst experiences at a restaurant ever. Will. Never. Ever. Ever. Return. You suck Yokoso!I've eaten here a few times, usually for chicken and shrimp teriyaki off the hibachi but this particular Tuesday I came on a solo mission for half off specialty sushi and I've never been more pleased.I started with the Spider Roll, a combination of of course rice and a seaweed wrap that has soft shell crab tempura, avocado, crab and cucumber add in a little wasabi sauce and eel sauce and you got yourself a combination you never want to stop coming.  So much so I was gonna venture off but stayed with this for 3 orders.  15 pieces of sushi and $20 later I couldn't be any happier.  The rolls came quick,the bartender served them with a smile and the price well, the price was worth every hard earned cent.  For the health conscious keep in mind what I ate was a total of 1000 calories and it surely will keep me full long through the evening.  The drinks are a little expensive but that's the price you pay for convenience at any restaurant.  They are always generously made and the beer is always cold.  The staff always welcomes me with open arms and throws in any extras you may need without a grunt like pickled ginger, wasabi, lemons and sauces.  I've been here before and now that I know about this day of the week I'll be coming back a bit more often but next time, with lots of people!
Papa Joe's Fish-N-Que=Joe's is on the South side of Bethany and a little West of 19th Ave, in a strip mall sort of. They have a large sign out front.Daaauumm good food. I had the cod, nice big flaky hunk-o-fish. A little over cooked but not too bad.The Shrimp, good size great crisp, good flavor. The beef rib, spicy (not spicy, just more flavor) Huge rib perfectly cooked and seasoned/sauced.Mac N Cheese, just like mamma use to make with welfare cheese! I had a chance to talk to Joe and his lovely wife, nice real people!Joe was kind enough to "lend" me a container of peach cobbler. I say lend because I WILL BE BACK FOR MORE. The burgers did not look like anything to write home about. Go for the fish N que.Some of the Best tasting Catfish that I've eaten out here in PHX. Reminds of what I used to get back home in East Texas. Turns out that most of Papa Joe's family are from Texas and they brought back those great tasting flavors to AZ. Nice!Love their simple menu of tasty treats. Catfish, Cod, and Whiting are all available in both regular or spicy. They have Shrimp, Hot Wings, Chicken Strips, BBQ Brisket, BBQ Pork, Ribs, Hot Links as well as Burgers and then some. The choices of sides are also a bonus and include items like Collard Greens, fried Okra, Potato Salad, Cole Slaw, Jalapeno Hush Puppies, Mac & Cheese, Onion Rings, Sweet Potato Tater Tots, Beans ... too many to list them all.Normally get the 3 pc Spicy Catfish with 4 Shrimp and a side of whatever with a giant Grape Drink. Boy that brings back the memories. My wife usually gets the Cod and Shrimp Basket with a side. I have not tried the BBQ yet but definitely have it on my radar for next time.Papa Joe and his crew are extremely friendly and most helpful. Everything is very good and you can tell they put a lot of Love and Soul into their food. Don't forget a little Granny Ann's Sweet Potato Pie, Peach Cobbler, Cheese Cake, or Pecan Pie to finish off your meal.Give Papa Joe a shout out and you will be pleased. Located in a small strip shop on the south side of Bethany and not in the hospital across street like the Yelp map suggest. TOUCHDOWN!5 STARSToday is National Catfish Day, so I thought of having a fried catfish meal at Papa Joe's. I definitely was not disappointed. I ordered the one-piece catfish combo; this included a humongous fillet of catfish. Good thing I decided to order only one piece; two would have been too much for me, even though an additional filet would not have cost much more. The combo also included some fried shrimp, a side (I chose potato salad), and a drink (iced tea for me). The catfish was really good - the fillet was tender, hot, and  juicy and was covered with a light, crunchy batter. They gave me 3 fried shrimp instead of the 2 that was supposed to come with the combo - I'm not complaining about that ;) and the potato salad was quite good. Everything - including the drink - for $6.05 plus tax. It's rare to come across a place that serves food this good and tasty for so little money.
Dickey's Barbecue Pit=Took the fam out for barbecue at Dickey's the other night and I must say it was really GOOD.  We ordered the family meal which was plenty for the four of us. I haven't had brisket this good since I lived in West Texas. We'll be going back!Grand Opening!!!Located at the Las Vegas Outlet Center right between Buffalo Wild Wings & Dunkin Donuts this place has finally opened. Yah!!!!I had been waiting for this place to open ever since I recieved their email newsletter telling me about this NEW Vegas location.I knew from checking out their website that it wasn't "smoked" bbq-they give instructions on how to bake them low & slow.So I had low expectations but it's BBQ it's NEW and that's really all it takes to get me in the door.The place was fairly busy with quite a large staff prepared to handle any rush. The mgmt was busy cleaning,greeting and making sure everyone was satisfied. Very friendly people.-The manager told me the lunch crowd was out the door & around the corner!!I was already starving having just got off of work so I went big and ordered a 3 meat plate with 2 sides & a roll. I got the beef brisket,pulled pork & pork ribs-$12 plus a Big Yellow Cup $2.The place smelled great so I was hoping the bbq would be as good and I was not at all disappointed.The meats were very tender & moist, fall-off the bone ribs and the sauce was sweet but had a little something to it I can't describe but it was pretty good. Kinda Caroilna-style.The baked potato casserole was an unusual yet delightful side and the mac n cheese was really mini shells & cheese and was nothing special it was NOT baked and kinda plain.Everyone in the place seemed to be enjoying themselves and the FREE ice cream was quite a hit, the BBQ was better than average, the sides ok, but the rolls were fantastic & it was super-FAST!They pride themselves on being a fast-food bbq stand. So for fast-food it totally rocks, for Vegas BBQ its better than average for a chain-store BBQ.Bring your kids in on Sundays to eat for FREE(12 & under)!!FREE ice cream all the time.Check it out!http://www.dickeys.com/bbq-cravin.aspxAnother Grand Opening!!I got an email saying they were giving awayy a 32" TV & $2.99 BBQ Sandwiches, so I bit.It was from 12-2 so I waited until 1:30 and the place was I packed after I ordered I had to wait for a seat to open up to be able to dine-in.I ordered 2 sandwiches To Go-Pork & Brisket.I also ordered a 3 meat platter-Pork Ribs(2),Beef Brisket & Pulled Pork plus 2 sides and a roll. I ordered mac n cheese & potato salad.The food came out fast & the staff was very attentive BUT....Disappoitning to say the least. The meat was cold, the food was altogether bland and mushy.The ribs were ok but bot good enough to justify $22!!This place is pricy and NOT my kind of BBQ. I like it with a little crunch and a little smoke flavor if they are claim claim to smoke it. BBQ sauce is sweet,watery and warmI will NOT be back.The Husband is all about some good barbecue and first heard of Dickeys during a recent visit to Reno.  When I mentioned that there was a location in Vegas, he was all over it.One of the bigger pluses on our visit was that I had an Entertainment Book coupon for BOGO free!  Score!We both decided on the 2 Meat Plate to maximize on the coupon and the variety of food to try.* The 2 Meat Plate ($10): Signature Chopped Beef Brisket and Sliced Beef Brisket, Waffle Iron Fries, Mac N Cheese - Although it's their signature chopped brisket, the Husband preferred the sliced one more.  The waffle iron fries could be seasoned too.  The mac n cheese was very creamy though.* The 2 Meat Plate ($10): Spicy Hot Links and Fall Off the Bone Pork Ribs, Fried Onion Tanglers, Baked Potato Casserole - The spicy hot links weren't all that spicy or impressive, sadly enough.  And the pork ribs were just okay.  We were expecting something different from the baked potato casserole when all it ended up being was mashed potatoes with some fixings.  The onion tanglers were just limp onion rings and were only okay as well.Both orders came with a bread roll and you can help yourself to dill pickle slices and barbecue sauce.They also offer Sweet Tea in their signature plastic yellow cups that you can take home.Ultimately, it sounded like a lot more food but in reality, it wasn't all that much.  Overall, it was just an okay experience with only okay food.  On the particular day we went, there was a line going out the door because of a promotion they were offering.  Other than that, we probably won't be back.  It just didn't live up to the barbecue hype we were expecting.
Two Hippies=DO NOT even attempt to go here for lunch during the week between 11:30-1:00. There are Xavier kids EVERYWHERE. You know what, just stay off Camelback all together. You've been warned.I've heard of the Magic Mushroom joint, but this came at me out of left field.  I decided to hit this shack with a work bud of mine (Groovy P.) to check it out.  The first thing I noticed (other than the wonderfully tacky decor) was the decent prices.  Tacos are $1.50 each (tax included).  I went with the Burro.  Honestly If they would have named the place Two Hippies and a Burro, I would have enjoyed myself more.  But Beachhouse is fine too, I guess.The guy taking orders is the owner himself.  He owns the Magic Mushroom place down on Indian School too.  I think its refreshing to have the owner taking orders.  Owners know how to do it right!  He asked me my first name and scribbled it onto a brown bag. NOW I'm diggin this place!  He was calling regulars up with nicknames like Snowman Steve, and Sarge.  I wanna be a regular to find out what awesome alter-persona he labels me.  Knowing my luck, he'd name me Conehead Chris or Corporate Chris or something else I wouldn't like. I wanna be Snowball Steve!The wait was long. 25 minutes long! Standing around staring at other people waiting. *Check watch* shuffle feet *Check watch*... Then I hear "CHRIS!!! PATIO PICKUP!"  Wtf?!?! Wheres the patio?So I get my food and scarf it down.  Carne Asada... not spiced for a typical burrito... Cabbage??? To say the least, it was pretty damn good.  For $4, you can't go wrong!  Next time I'll just get 2 tacos...I'll be back, Mr. Hippy...If you have a longish lunch hour, go.  I went around 5pm tonight and there was nobody in front of me.  Took me 5 minutes to get my fish burrito (Thanks to Chris T for the recommendation!)It was HUGE and came with a little cup of two salsas: green and red.  I cut it in half to enjoy the salsas separately.  Filled to the brim with rice, cheese, beans and the fish and smothered in some sort of sauce, it was delicious!  Service was super-friendly and everyone had a smile on their face and said "Amy, your fish burrito is ready!"  I mean, the personalized service was great.  Maybe hitting them at a slow hour was what did it.  There is a little retail spot where you can get incense (they're hippies, get it???) and posters on the wall to peruse while waiting.  I took mine home, but the patio is lovely.  There's even a vintage bike parked out front with little baskets filled with potted plants.  How adorable is that????Besides being a good taco/burrito/lemonade stand, THBH is imo the coolest club house on the block. It's chock-full of knickknacks, posters, and snarky signage that will keep you occupied while waiting for your order. I wasn't even bothered by the lingering smell of lavender incense, plenty of which to select from. I purchased opium and cherry. Nope, never gonna burn em; impulse buy. The side patio is a great spot to sit and munch on 2 dollar tacos while being windblown by industrial coolers and misting systems. I love it. Tonight's attraction, Poetry Slam, and man this was one slam jam. Note to self, take up ripping people to shreds by way of organized angry verbal release. Possible new found therapy. My mental first draft in play as a sit sipping on a paper parasol topped watermelon lemonade. In sum, I find one word that describes this jaunt, E-CLECTIC! Beats the heck out of drive-thru any day.Ok. So I've never actually been to Two Hippies BHOTAB...but I'm going to review it anyway. JUST KIDDING! I've had take out but someone else has always picked it up for me. You know. I have people for that. First off I must say for bong sake you have the longest restaurant name evah! Secondly I must say your pork tacos really hit the spot. Granted one side of the tortilla becomes a bit slimy by the time it reaches me (from my people) and the foil is unwrapped (again, my people) and I finally plunge that delicious hippie taco into my boca. The pork is moist (ewww, i don't usually say moist...OMG...I said it twice) and a little crunchy in parts. Perfection. Seasoned with love. Like a good hippie. A few beans, cabbage, cheese and tomatoes thrown in and I'm happier than a hippie at a Patchouli sale. Or happier than a hippie in a muraled van selling incense and bongs on Venice Beach. Or happier than....oh...you get the idea. All this love for under $2 a taco. Now I know why you are Outgrageous! I may tye dye a t shirt, get out the Nag Champa and pop in Dazed and Confused. Now. Damnit. Where is that bag of Doritos?Now we stand at a crossroads; perhaps a dilemma. Is it truly Mexican when it's not made by Mexicans? Is a taco a taco just because someone said it is? Or a burrito? The philosophies and debates of Mexican food can go on for hours. But I like to think of it like this: If it tastes good, who cares?This is the case with Two Hippies Beach House. Opened by the same Two Hippies, Andy and Jan Goldstein, who brought us Two Hippies Magic Mushroom Burger, they use words like tacos and burritos but never actually say they serve Mexican food.What they do serve is an accessible, mostly delicious, well-priced menu. Really, any three tacos are $5, anytime!If you've ever been to some of the surf shacks in San Diego, you'll notice it's like they picked one up and dropped it on the corner of Camelback Road and 5th Street â€" sans the sand of course.In true Two Hippies fashion, every square inch of this small establishment is absolutely covered with kitsch of all kinds; such blissful tackiness. The front is about the size of a postage stamp, barely enough room to stand after ordering at the counter. Once your order is ready, they call out your name. You can take your stash home or go around back and pull up a picnic table.While you wait, take in all the decorations, though if you have some condition of OCD, you might have a problem with the clutter and want to start arranging and organizing. I had to put my hands under my seat so as not to give in to my secret urges.The emphasis on the menu is tacos, as well as the hot dogs and lemonades. Two Hippies also can make any of the taco flavors into a burrito like the Red Beef ($5). The burritos are massive. If I had to guess, Iâ€™d say they probably are close to a pound. They are loaded with tender red chile beef, rice and beans, and they fill you up big time.The Cheese Crisp with Chicken ($4.50) is also huge and fully packed with tender chicken, onion, guacamole, tomato and cabbage. Itâ€™s much lighter than the burrito but still very filling.On another other visit I stuck with the tacos, ordering up the Taco 3 Pack ($5) and choosing fish, cactus and chicken. These tacos are massive, like all the food at Two Hippies. Youâ€™ll never leave hungry.Interestingly, Two Hippies does not use corn tortillas, opting instead for the medium sized flour variety.I'm always leery about ordering fish since we live hundreds of miles from the closest ocean, and on one visit my instincts were spot on. The fish was so strong I could only manage a few bites, even with the delicious red salsa it couldn't help that poor fish.Although another visit revealed the fish to be spot on, flaky and mild, so the fish taco could be a crap shoot. The chicken taco was a chicken taco, good with a nice balance of veggies and meat. However my favorite was the cactus taco, tender sliced cactus topped with cabbage, onion, tomato, rice, beans and cilantro. The cactus had a delicate sweet flavor and with so many textures was a delight to chow.Beach House also serves up several different topped all beef hot dogs. I had the pleasure of trying the No. 6 ($3.75), which is pretty much the kitchen sink model. A soft squishy bun covered with pinto beans, cheese, jalapeos, mustard, ketchup, mayo and guacamole. Whew, this is like the daddy of all hot dogs. I think this could have been even a plain dog and I would have loved it.I'm not sure where they get their hot dogs, but the meat in this one was just so tasty, the toppings only added to my pleasure.There are eight other hot dogs that also piqued my interest like the No. 4 ($4) that has feta, pesto-mayo, bacon, tomato and onion and the No. 8 ($3.75), which is covered simply in guacamole. I had forgotten how much I enjoy a good hot dog, look out Costco!With 16 base flavors, the lemonades ($3) are a great way to to complete your meal. They use shaved ice so it's almost like having a slushy â€" complete with a brain freeze if you don't take your time. You can also combine different flavors to come up with your own custom lemonade flavor. The fun part is trying your different creations. Cherry and raspberry were nice and tart, but one combo was even better, the strawberry and peach. For me this almost had a creaminess from the round flavor of the peaches, this could be my signature drink on any upcoming visits if there weren't so many other choices.Two Hippies Beach House does a pretty good job of bringing the walk-up taco shack to Central Phoenix, and it certainly entices all sorts of people. So if you decide to check this place out and you see a big bear stuffing his face with a yummy hot dog or one of the cactus tacos, please feel free to say hi.I was out running a couple of errands last week and a friend called and suggested lunch at Two Outraged Hippies Taco's and Beach something:)I hadn't been to a Two Hippies for a couple of years...I think it was their burger joint...that one didn't make much of an impression on me either way :-IBut I thought to myself...well, I like lunch:)And, I like taco's:)And I was a hippie of the first water back in my day (which, BTW, means that it's no longer "My Day", sadly:(But I'm not thrilled by Two Hippies taco's:(I got dos taco's...a chicken and a carne asada, along with a can of soda pop...the people taking my $5.00 cash were very nice (and they were trying to dress up like hippies or something, too!...too adorable for words:)I didn't get fish taco's...experience (the kind gained through trial and many, many errors)...has taught me that the only place that I really like to get fish tacos, is from one of the beach palapa's in Bahia de Navidad...where the panga's pull right up on the sand...the fishermen jump out and hand the cook in the palapa a red snapper or dorado or something else with fins...they clean it, cut it up, grill it, throw some lettuce and homemade salsa on it and it's a taco about 30 minutes after it quit swimming:)Those are pretty good fish taco's...esp. washed down with a cerveza or three:)...I don't remember the name of the place...probably "taco de playa" or something...just walk down the beach...you can't miss it:)10 pesos each for the taco's, 25 pesos a pop for the cerveza...it's a very good deal:)...BTW, that doesn't include round-trip first class airfare or the Governors Suite at the Grand Bay:)No beach at 5th and Camelback:(But, I digress:)I liked the service and the price (and I really appreciate the staff trying to look like hippies for me...really...a blast from past:)I really didn't care for the food, itself...outrageous has a number of different connotations, depending on context...but I didn't find the taco's "outrageous" in any sense of the word:)Although nowhere near as bad as Skip & Jan's attempt at taco's, the hippies taco's leave more than a bit to be desired...the carne asada was dry, stringy, bland, and the salsa they give you in the little plastic cups didn't really improve things.So I tried the chicken taco and found it to be dry, stringy, bland, and the salsa they gave...!Hey wait a minute...did they just give me two of the same thing and try to call them something different?!?!?...That would be so like the hippies I knew back in the `60's and `70's:-)...always stoned, never quite sure what they were doing...so much fun to watch:)But no, they gave me carne asada and chicken...the taco's just looked and tasted very much alike (the chicken was somewhat whiter, but other than that...not much difference:(In Phoenix, a city with so many options for getting my taco fix, even the nostalgia for times long gone (and thankfully so...can you imagine a world in which all we want to do is sit around all day, get high, and make love...not war...where would we all be? :-) can't make up for these lackluster offerings:(There are tons of better taco shop's...many of which don't even require the plane ride and hotel stay:)I was lucky enough to meet up here with Christina P for lunch yesterday.  The menu is currently the same as the other beach house with soft tacos, burritos and hot dogs.  They are are planning to add tamales to the regular menu and we got to try a sample of pork tamale and it was tasty.I got the three tacos for $5 and a lemonade for $3.  There are several flavors of lemonade but I got the plain.  I got one each of fish, carne asada and chicken.  They were all tasty and I tried some of both the green and red sauces on them.  One thing I noticed is the meat didn't stand out on any of them and there was very little taste difference between the three.  All the ingredients were fresh and there was nothing soggy.  I thought the lemonade was good.They have only been open a week and of course the place is spotless.  The two employees we dealt with were very pleasant.  I always carry cash which is a good thing because that is all they take.  There is an ATM in the lobby.  I haven't been to their other location but I am told it is much smaller. Inside there were 5 2tops and some stools with a couple of tables outside too.  The tables would seat 3 or 4 (cramped) so I think they should have a couple of additional chairs.Overall I see it as a good neighborhood place to grab a quick bite to eat but certainly not a destinationSeeing the word "hippies" in the restaurant name had me stoked, as them tree-huggin hippie types got to have some vegetarian food, right? Yep.I walked up to the lil window and asked about the veggie options, the guy behind the counter informed me that they have a cactus burrito and that it was one of his favorites. Score! Or so I thought...Upon receiving the large, heavily stuffed burrito, I bit in with high hopes. Those hopes quickly dissipated as I found that the innards of the burrito were primarly COLD. The cactus pieces were cold, the cheese wasn't melted at all. The only thing that had a bit of warmth were the beans, which weren't even hot, they were luke warm.Sorry guys, but a cold burrito isn't going to cut it. Make that cactus, beans and rice HOT in your burritos if you want some customers. Melt the friggin cheese in there, don't leave it ice cold.I was out running errands when I got hungry and decided to take a shot on Two Hippies Beach House. I pulled in and almost hit a crack head who walked in front of my car with two Phoenix Police Officers as witnesses to this mishap. After waiting for said crack head to skitter away, I got out of my car and approached the line. One of the officers said to me "Good brakes!" Whew! For my lunch, I decided on a fish burro sans cilantro and a peach lemonade. I was thankful for the cash I had in my wallet as they do not accept plastic of any form. I only had to wait for about 5 minutes for my food to be done and I was on my way home. I unwrapped my burro and took a huge bite. Hmm... nothing too amazing, just ok. First off. I DISLIKE when restaurants don't warm the tortilla that they make burros with and yes, this Blatina can tell the difference. Second, the burro was FULL of cabbage and not a lot of fish. The salsa was good and flavorful so I used a lot of it to flavor the burro and it brought some good spice to the burro. Overall it was just ok. Nothing amazing and nothing I would crave. The real winner was the peach lemonade that comes in slushy form. Yum! I would visit Two Hippies again to try their other offerings. The price is good, and the food is ok.Three taco's for $6, and that's the every day price. ;-)I've had Two Hippies Beach House about three times now and there's just something about them that doesn't quite sit right. I want to love them for the $6 / three tacos meal, but my GI system seems to say otherwise. I've had different combinations of tacos here with varying success, and since I'm no masochistic I must gracefully withdraw my name from ballot for "Duke of the Beach House." - no write in's, please.Maybe it's the enourmose portions per taco, or perhaps the combination of spices used when cooking the beef. Maybe it was the rice, or extra sliced jalepenos I always ask for. Either way, the food had a good taste, and a great price, but just doesn't agree with my sensitive 'personality'; I guess. :-/Alas, I live to fight the good (food) fight in this ever lasting battle.Happy Yelping Phoenix.
Superbook Deli=Cheap eats @LasVegasHilton Great sandwiches,hotdogs and breakfast.Reasonably priced and made to order.WARNING: the hamburgers are NOT SO GOOD!!BUT...Deli sandwiches are some of the BEST anywhere!!Stopped in here for lunch to grab a quick bite before a college football game on Saturday.  I've been here many times.  On this last visit, I ordered a 6" Italian Sub.You order the Sandwich from the cashier and you receive a number, then a server brings out the order to your table.  Very convenient.  Since it's located next to the SuperBook, there are plenty of Plasma TVs with sporting events and horse racing to keep you distracted while you wait for your food.  There's also a ton of seating, so you'll be sure to find a place to sit unlike many of the sportsbook delis in Vegas.After a short wait our food was ready.  The Meat & toppings were fresh.  This Deli advertises that they use Boar's Head Deli Meats, so that's always a plus....I love Boar's Head products.  Although it was only a 6" Sandwich, it was very filling.Overall, great experience & great service.Will I return?  Of course!
Mix Zone Cafe=We've been hearing the rage about Mix Zone Cafe and finally got a taste of it at the Yelp Elite Event a few months back.  We were highly impressed by their 3 Color Curry then and we wanted more!The Grilled Beef Salad "grilled beef with red onion, tomato and cilantro, seasoned with lime juice and Thai chili" ($7.95) was an easy choice as this is one of the Husband's favorite Thai dishes.  He initially chose "Hot" for their heat level and I reminded him that others have commented on how extra hot their heat was here.  So, he changed it to Medium.  Disappointingly, it was more like a Mild heat.  It was good, but we wanted the heat after all!We also shared their signature dish of 3 Color Curry "A Mix Zone special blend of red, yellow, and green curry and all their vegetables with choice of meat." ($9.95) with tofu.  I also went for Medium too, but did wish it was spicier after we got it.  I also appreciated the mix of veggies in there - string beans, carrots, bamboo shoots, carrots, bell peppers and cucumbers.Another incentive was that they were now offering all day lunch specials and a free brown rice upgrade.  Well, this wasn't the case anymore when we went.  (Although they still had the lunch special signage outside even though it was clearly dinner time.)  Brown rice now costs $.50 more.  And we also discovered they are no longer accepting coupons.  Overall, we enjoyed our meal but left a bit disappointed.  The heat just wasn't there, so I guess it depends on who is working the kitchen when you go.  It's definitely worth checking out when they are running their lunch specials though!3.5 stars.Don't get your heart set on any one dish here, because chances are, they'll be out of it. I have come by more than once when my first choice dish was unavailable. Perhaps they don't stock certain meats because they don't get much business, but I haven't noticed a consistent trend as to which items are out.The fried catfish was just okay- lots of peppers and onions, good amount of basil, but spicier than expected. The three-color curry is hyped as being "only available here!", but the version at Le Thai is a bit better, this one was watery. I keep wanting to try their green curry fried rice, but it has been out twice now- which is baffling, considering they still obviously serve both rice and curry.Heads up, the spice scale is wonky- it's one to four, and a two is hotter than expected. I guess the choice is none or too much? No clue.
Montreal En Scene=En Scene is in the Montreal - Trudeau airport, past the customs of the International concourse, but before you walk toward the gates.Being in Montreal, I was expecting breakfast to be more continental, like in western Europe with toast, danish, thin slices of meats, espresso, some cheese and fruit. But here at En Scene, they served a great North American/English influenced country style breakfast, except with that great French Pan, the large thick slices of French White bread. My order (all figures in $CAD):1 Cafe                      $1.79 1 Jus D'orange      $3.992 Oeufs (Brouille)Roties BlancJambon                   $6.49So a great hot breakfast of 2 eggs, ham and that great thick bread with little servings of peanut  butter and jam (it's Quebec!) for $6.49! Look out Denny's!
Le Taj="Cuisine indienne" as its called in these parts, was a something I was craving for badly during one of my last trips to Montreal. Already a city filled with so many ethnic options, Taj was literally the closest Indian place near our hotel. There are almost always questions for me before I head out to a new place: Is it local? Who goes there? What are the prices? How is the food? etc. Without consultation of my group due to my affinity for Indian cuisine, I immediately set forth for Le Taj and never looked back. It so happened to be during their lunch buffet hour, which at that time was priced at $12.95. Even before the clock struck noon, the place was crowded enough to warrant a wait for 4. While I waited I noticed how clean and modern the restaurant was. Some gourmet Indian establishments prefer the maharaja palatial look, where as Le Taj was simple, elegant, and sophisticated.The buffet was wonderfully presented. Everything from the serving spoon to the trays they were served in were immaculate. There was a service person on hand to wipe away any immediate spills and adjust items if they were put out of place. I thought the job was a bit tedious and unnecessary initially, but it really does make a difference for how people perceive lunch hour gluttony in buffet form.There was an amazing slew of options, with an adequate veggie to meat ratio along with some stellar desserts and sides. All of this food was presented in an open window where someone in the back was baking fresh naan (to be served table side) and dangling along a skewer was some freshly made tandoori chicken. I couldn't stop eating the fish curry here, it was perfectly flaky, the curry was rich without all the excess oil. I was also a very impressed with their lamb vindaloo, which was a little bit sweet and a lot savory, I went for seconds only moments after gobbling the first go-around. The naan was fluffy and even fragrant; a puffy bit of goodness that was a great complement to the meal. With the exception of rasmalai and burfi, I am not one for desserts, however the mini-grenade sized galub jamuns were as stellar as I've ever had.Service was quick and professional. They were attentive throughout the experience and were awesome all around. They were also armed with individual credit card machines, which made it an easy process to check out and pay without hassle.I've been back several times since and I've been quite satisfied each time. The buffet has since surged to $14.95, but with that the options have also been souped up as well. I've eaten some scrumptious veggie dishes (veggie samosa, fried cauliflower, sag paneer, aloo gobi, eggplant) and some excellent meat curries (goat biriyani, sag murgh, chicken makhani), which have all been delicious enough to give this place my blessing.
Restaurant Nhu Y=As you may know, Vietnam was colonized by the French for many, many long years, so it has a French influence (like in the french bread Vietnamese sandwiches made famous by Lee's Sandwiches, which are franchised everywhere). So here in Montreal, it is only natural to find many Vietnamese restaurants, just like in France. Nhu Y restaurant is known for its Chef, who was trained in French cooking schools in Vietnam. The 2 dishes this restaurant is famous for according to the local Vietnamese diaspora is Canh Chua Ca Bong Lau, or sweet and sour Catfish Soup, which has a great mix of flavors. And the other is their signature appetizer, Chicken Wings, marinated in Nuoc Mam (fish sauce) and crisped up for a great combination of texture and flavor. Tres Delicieux!
Copper Door=So the husband has taken my yelping as a mission to find new and better places recently. Going to the Copper Door was his idea, but I won't hold it against him.On a Sunday night for dinner this place was EMPTY. Well, not completely empty, there was one other couple in the entire restaurant.  The atmosphere is beautiful: wonderful photographs of old Phoenix, a baby grand piano, and the most beautiful ceiling tiles I've ever seen (not that I make a habit out of looking at the ceiling).We both ordered the iced tea, and it was incredibly delicious.  I have a feeling that they add just a shriggle of sugar to cut down on the typical bitter flavor of tea, without making it sweet.As Maria F. states, the menu does claim to have vegan options.  I saw three that were labled vegan, although one contained honey.  I would doubt their understanding of what is vegan food.Then came our meals.  Mine was the artichoke and cheese stuffed ravioli with shrimp, or at least it was supposed to be.  When the waiter brought out my dish, it was just  plate of raviolis.  I thought at first that I misunderstood, and that maybe the shrimp was inside the pasta.  So I tried to cut open the pasta and I had to put muscle into it.  To my dismay, no shrimp.  I told the waiter that I ordered shrimp, he looked confused and said he would be back.  He came back 3-5 minutes later to say that he would take my plate and be back.  About 10 minutes later I get the same dried-out, hard pasta raviolis with 4 shrimp.  The waiter said he put extra on.  Extra what?  The husband's well-done burger was medium at best.  While I was waiting for my food, he said that he had eaten better and larger burgers at Seamus's next door.Luckily, the waiter didn't charge us the full $17 for the man's undercooked meat patty and a side of cottage cheese, just $10.  And he didn't add the $5 to my $17 dish for the shrimp, not even the extra one.  And the hostess saw us at Seamus's afterwards and was dissappointed about our experience.  She was very helpful, nice and gave us a 15% off coupon for lunch which she said was very good and not as pricey.  I might give them another chance, but it won't be at dinnertime.
Spak Brothers Pizza and More=My roommate and I were starving and needed to go grocery shopping.  I really wanted a sub, but the Jimmy Johns in Bakery Square has the worst delivery area ever.  I had seen Spak Brothers on Yelp and was a bit skeptical of the location.  Thank goodness we braved the cold and Garfield.The Italian hoagie was amazing.  For $8.88, I ended up with three meals out of the hoagie.  The meat was delicious with no fat pieces, and there was the perfect balance and combination of toppings.  I also ordered a slice of cheese pizza for $1.87, and that was delicious as well.  The amount of food you get for the price is amazing.And to top it all off, they have a thousand vegan options?  I can't wait to come back and try the vegan options too!The service was efficent, and there are 2 pinball tables at $.75/game to play while you wait for food.  This is definitley a take-out establishment.Credit cards accepted!I've been wanting to try Spak Brother for awhile now. From co-workers raving about it to the artistic exterior to the building, I wanted to see what the hoopla was all about. I was in Bloomfield for work so I decided to stop by and grab a sandwich. The inside is nothing to brag about. It's not somewhere I'd be comfortable eating inside at, but I don't think they market it that way so I can't really take points off because of that. There are a few places to sit and a pinball table, but nothing substantial. The menu is decent sized. All the basics and nothing too too fancy. I went with the grilled chicken breast hoagie with lettuce, tomato, cheese and ranch dressing. It took about 15-20 minutes to make, but it was well worth the wait! Everything was so fresh and tasty. It practically melted in my mouth. The best part was the ranch dressing. It was so creamy and full of flavor. I am obsessed with homemade ranch sauces and this was one of the best I've ever tasted. The sandwich (half) was $6 including tax and I think it was reasonably priced. Most full sandwiches went between $8-$9. I'm excited to go back and try some more options on the menu! Nothing better than supporting local business, especially those on Penn Avenue during all of this messy construction!I've been wanting to try Spak forever, so when a friend and I wanted to get takeout yesterday night, I decided to finally try it.  Calling ahead at 5:30pm, we were given an estimate of 20 min., which wasn't too bad and worked out perfectly for us, given the location of my apt.  We showed up at 6pm, and our order was ready for us upon arrival, so after paying, we headed back to my place to consume the goods.Our order consisted of a medium (14") pepperoni and ricotta pizza and an order of honey mustard seitan wings ($20 together).  The seitan wings were quite good--the best I've had, though I've only had them at one other place in PGH--and the honey mustard sauce was delicious.  The pizza was delicious--in fact, I'd say it was some of the best pizza I've had in PGH, and I've tried many pizza places to date, as can be seen from my pizza list.  While the crust wasn't perfectly crispy the way I like it, it did have some crispness, and I particularly liked the flavor and consistency of the dough once I bit into it.  The toppings were flavorful and well proportioned, and worked well together, despite my doubts that they might be odd together.  My friend was impressed with the wings and pizza, as well, confirming my impressions.Overall, I'd say that Spak Bros. lived up to its reputation.  A couple of friends of mine who enjoyed Spak and recommended it commented that they don't feel hipster enough when they walk in to pick up their order, and I saw what they mean, since my friend and I definitely looked square compared to all of the employees and other customers.  Even if you're as un-hipster as us, I'd recommend stopping by, since Spak undoubtedly has some of the best pizza in PGH.
Salvadoreño Restaurant=See what happens when you wait too long to write your review!? Phoenix Magazine beats you to the punch and lists one of your favorite finds as one of the Valley's best dishes! Oh well, I guess I should just feel "validated."Here's my take on this place:For $12.50 you get a platter full of diced shrimp ceviche bordered by at least a dozen grilled regular sized shrimp and no less that a whole avocado's worth of wedges. It's served with crisp, flat, tostada chips and is plenty to share! A real value!!If I'm dining alone, I generally get a couple of pupusas. Pupusas are like thick corn tortillas stuffed with cheese, beans or meat - your pick! They even offer a version stuffed with the loroco flower, which I understand is similar to a squash blossom. Myself? I'm a bean and cheese girl most of the time. And, I prefer them straight up: skip the tomato sauce and slaw topping. The chicken soup is flavorful and the portion size is significant, served with a couple of handmade tortillas.Salvadoreno recently got a beer and wine license, and, a I can't think of a better beverage to wash down a pupusa than an ice cold beer!Oh! I guess this can be my "scoop" - Salvadoreno is going to start offering a $7.95 lunch buffet from 11 - 3. Buffet items will vary depending on the day of the week.  I'm feelin' a pupusa eating contest as a lunchtime UYE!What a delightful break from the norm. Papusas are the main attraction here, and they do them so well. I had the pork and one with loroco flower--both were wonderful. This was the second time I've had papusas (the first being at a papusa festival last year) and they were just as great as I remember them. We started off with the shrimp salad which included grilled shrimp on cucumber slices, topped with avocado and surrounding a bed of mini-shrimp. Served on tostada or just on a fork, it was lovely. I'll definitely be coming back here when I'm jonesing for papusas. Note: A cursory understanding of Spanish is helpful, as our server spoke limited English.So, I finally had a pupusa!  I was at Art Walk in the 'Slope tonight and arrived starving.  I knew I was going to come here for a pupusa.The food is cheap!  I got a bean and cheese pupusa and a bean tamale and spent I think $6.  My tamale wasn't quite heated up.  It wasn't fridge-cold, but nearly.  The pupusa was really rich and loaded with filling.  I was really full by the time I finished my meal.I'll be back again because Dottsy got a shrimp one and I had a bite and it was yummy!  It was nice talking to the owner.  They're from El Salvador and I spent time in Central America going to college.  It was nice hearing the Central American accent, since I'm surrounded by the Mexican dialect here.  Made me miss the warm sandy beaches of Costa Rica.So after tasting this place at the Yelp Science Center party I KNEW I had to go check this place out! I had never even heard of a Pupusas until that fateful Yelp night. The hubs and I rolled in about 7:30ish. We were the only ones in the place aside from the waiter and the cook. We took a seat and the waiter came on over with menus in hand. He was really helpful, I told him I didn't know what I had at the yelp party but I wanted it again. I had the shredded beef, bean and cheese pupusas. So tasty. The hubs and I also split an order of the potato and cheese puff things. It was like a deep fried mashed potato missile! So crunchy on the out side yet so fluffy on the inside. Hubs got 3 pupusas, two shrimp and a steak. I sampled the steak and it was pretty bomb! He went nuts over the shrimp, but I skipped trying it out, wasn't in the shrimp frame of mind. The one thing I wasn't a total fan of was the coleslaw, it has a very vinegary, dill, I don't know what kind of taste. I am VERY finicky with my coleslaw though, hubs said he liked it. The restaurant itself is nothing to write home about. Its olllllld. The tables and chairs are from the late 80's and worn. There was some rad gangsta rap playing over the speakers and Bones reruns on the tv, but when I noticed the time and asked if they could switch the tv to american idol (yes I am a nerd) He gladly did so and turned down the rap. Pretty rad. So for an iced tea, a total of four pupusas and some tasty deep fried potato puff guys, the bill was only $13.99 (with the coupon they gave out at the yelp event). We left very full.Hey! They've got vegan bean pupusas! What's a pupusa? A breaded pocket, kinda like a really really thick doughy tortilla, with a filling inside. The 2 papusa combo comes with rice (made with no animal products), a little cup of beans, salsa and a spicy coleslaw that is delish.Their menu says "ask about our vegan & vegetarian options", but when I told our server we were vegan, she suggested a bunch of cheese items, so apparently she didn't know what vegan means, but I explained.Even so, it's nice that they have options for those of the vegan persuasion. I am bummed that they only have ONE papusa option for us and that is beans. There are a few other veggie+cheese types, but they told us that the fillings are premade and they can't remove the cheese, so that's lame. We also asked if they could make us a potato papusa and they said no.Wish they would offer a few more vegan options, especially some additional vegan pupusa types!You know how some people say that those little mom & pops "hole-in-the-wall" restaurants make the best food? Well, this is THAT place. Seriously, words can't express how much I love pupusas, and choices are limited here in Phoenix, but this place does it right. For those of you who have never had one, it's like a thick homeade tortilla stuffed with cheese and pork- or whatever you choose as the filling, then topped with this pickled cabbage/onion/carrot mixture. Amazing. Pupusas are only around 2 bucks each, and you only need 2 or 3 to fill you up. Come check this place out- I know I'll be back soon.Pupusa. Say that word 5 times fast. Then go get one from Salvadoreno! I am a big fan of Salvadoreno. Especially when it comes to their pupusas. Pupusas are cornmeal patties filled with meat and/or cheese, veggies, or even cactus flower. They are super delicious and filling to say the least. I have had Salvadoreno create "mini pupusas" for several parties that I have hosted and they have been a HIT with my friends. I know a lot of my friends are now pupusa fans because of Salvadoreno! Try a pupusa with a side of crema...yes, it will change your life!I have had a meal at their restaurant a few times as well and have not been disappointed once. The restaurant is more of a "quick meal" or cafe type of setting rather than a nice sit-down restaurant. I will keep this review nice and short because how else can you say how delicious something is?  I look forward to more pupusas in my life!
Royal Mcgregor=A wee dram?  Oh h e double l no.  After three flights, four airports, 12 time zones and 22  hours of travel; three fingers please!Listed as one of 55 recommended restaurants in the Michelin Guide for Edinburgh, this one was admittedly chosen for their selection of whiskey.  Of course the food is good.For starters, the first taste of cold smoked Scottish salmon.  Incredibly rich, fatty, very smooth mouth feel.  The intense razor sharp flavor of salmon, unmistakable.  The game terrine, outstanding.  Course ground bits of this and that with a light livery flavor and anise overtones.  Great texture unfortunately, the traditional oatcakes; lets just say horse biscuits are not for me.For mains, a dish known as Crofters Chicken (oven baked chicken breast stuffed with hagggis served with a whisky sauce, sauteed cabbage and root veg).  A brilliant way to introduce haggis to the uninitiated.  The mineral, livery flavor of the offal is mellowed by the chickeny, poultry flavor.  The jus from the chicken moistens the haggis.  The whisky sauce adding a velvity, rich, concentrated whisky flavor to the dish.  Good eats.Very good selection of whisky (nearly 100), many offered in flights for tasting.  All flights come complete with the requisite water and chocolates.  Do not be that guy who asks for ice.  They will frown at that faux pas as it will cloud the whisky and ruin it.Friendly service.  Very reasonably priced.  Mains average £12.A charming, fairly priced pub with great whisky and food.  A fitting welcome to Edinburgh.
Brasserie Capri=I've wanted to visit this place ever since I  saw Anthony Bourdain travel & food show Montreal episode. I must say I was a  bit skeptical at first on whether it is as good as it looks on TV, but my love for pork knuckles overcame any doubts I've had.This place is full of simplicity and old traditions, it's a pub with a local diner atmosphere and an outside terrace. It's perfect for a quick bite to eat and to have some delicious food and drinks with your friends. It's very local, most of the regular customers are older gentlemen and some couples, but then again it was on weekday afternoon, so it's possible the crowd is different during the weekends.Nevertheless, I fell in love with the place. The service was impeccable and quick, the atmosphere was warm, full of smiles and jokes and recommendations from other customers and regulars. The pork knuckle was simply delightful! I love hearty simple foods and this place was more than perfect for "no occasion late lunch". I'd definitely recommend this place to anyone looking to meet with friends, have some 'home-style hearty food' which can be heavy on a stomach (if you eat as much as I did) but easy on your wallet (the bill was also a pleasant surprise).
Olive & Gourmando=Beautiful, everything is simply beautiful here! The food, the guests, the music, the decor, the staff and the list goes on. Whether you are local or from out of town, you have to stop by for a little bit of sunlight in your life!A few saturdays ago I finally decided to step into this institution that I've heard so much about and always wanted to try. After a short wait, the host promptly found a seat for me. While perusing the very sober breakfast menu, I was going to select a  healthy choice until Corinne, the friendly server, urged me to try the spicy poached eggs panini and promised that I would not regret it. And am I glad I listened to her... not that I have anything against a good dose of homemade granola with yogourt and fruit salad, but who could refuse a piping hot & crispy on the outside and soft on the inside panini, rich tasting eggs, dressed with siracha, herbs, melted Comté cheese, tasty speck "pork", and roasted tomatoes? Paired with a creamy Latte and sweet chocolate banana brioche, I was ready to start the day.O+G has been on my "must try" list forever and I'm glad I finally did. Open since 1998 the owners have reinvented the business; evolving it from artisan bakery to a full blown restaurant which now specializes in breakfast, paninis and viennoiseries! Everything is freshly made on premise including from the bread used for the sandwiches. The success of this place most probably lies with the fact that the staff is proud of the product they serve, are attentive to your needs, and are just generally cheery - even on a -19C morning. Marie-Helene, Corinne, and Elise thank you for adding a smile to my day!If you dream of spending a weekend morning down in old montreal, imbued in a gentle hustle and bustle atmosphere with soft jazz vocals playing in the background while you enjoy reading your favorite newspaper (or article on your tablet) or mingle with the locals and visitors, then this is the place for you!Masters of texture and spice, especially along the salty/crunchy/spicy taste nexus.The #5 (chevre) sandwich with grilled onions and homemade ketchup was fabulous and the #6 (pork, asparagus, cheese) was even better, blasts of flavor in every bite.Perpetually crowded so it's easiest to get takeout.Come early because they seem to run out of stuff quickly.One word. Actually a few words. The Cuban. That is the only thing I have there and I have been eating there for 7 years.Every time I set foot in here for breakfast (or lunch), I'm always pleased with the food quality, the excellent & friend service and the eclectic and welcoming decor!You'll often hear patrons of Olive & Gourmand complimenting them on the "concept"... interesting because when you ask veteran Marie-Helene and Sandra, or "old crusts" as they jokingly call themselves, there is no concept. It's just the result  of a slow evolution of bringing goodness and joy to people, season after season.The hustle and bustle can perhaps turn off some people who prefer quietness when sipping their café but if you're like me and love the vibe, the energy, the possibility of striking serendipitous conversations with locals or out-of-towners, and the soothing humming of the hustle & bustle this iconic place delivers then you're in for happy times!
Marche Kim Hour=Solid, convenient market. Lots of selection, reasonable prices.Stopped in to grab breakfast. Lo and behold were a selection of banh mi. I spotted two bins marked identically (Vietnamese pork sandwiches), except one had "spy" written. No clue what that meant, so I grabbed one (I wouldn't last long on Survivor), and an Aloe drink (decided against beer). Paid about C$4, in cash.The drink was good, and the sandwich was fine for what it was, where it was. The sheen on the sandwich freaked me out when I first unwrapped it, but it ended up being satisfying overall, with pickles, cold cuts, and jalapenos.
Saigon Saigon=Nur mittags wird ein asiatisches Buffet zum günstigen Preis angeboten. Abends gibt es Menüs und Tellergerichte, die auf einer bebilderten Speisekarte (für Touristen) ablesbar sind. Diese Gerichte sehen zumeist etwas unappetitlich aus, sind aber reichlich bemessen und mit etwas Glück schmecken sie sogar. Am besten schaut man den vielen hier anwesenden Asiaten auf Tisch und Teller und ordert deren Menüs nach. Überhaupt sind in diesem Lokal sehr viele Asiaten anzutreffen, die durchweg von der nicht bebilderten Karte bestellen.
Moishe's Steakhouse=Oh.My.God.Where do I begin?Dinner buddy and I recently came across the dine after nine website: dineafternine.ca  where normally high-end restaurants offer reduced-price menus for after 9pm and it's a total steal! We've decided we're going to hit as many of them as possible.So we started with Moishe's Steak house, a real Montreal establishment. This is the kind of place where steaks START at $50 (there's a reason why prices aren't listed on their website), the kind of old-world style of steakhouse where businessmen usually come to end deals, like Peter Luger's for instance in Brooklyn. The  after 9pm menu is far smaller than the main menu but nonetheless, it still gives you plenty of choices to have the whole Moishe's experience. I figured since I was going for the Rib steak, I wanted to start with something light and had the Caesar Salad. Nothing special but good nonetheless. My friend had the salmon tartare and loved it.Both of us ordered Rib steaks and people, it's official, this is the place where you will eat literally the best steak of your life, no joke. Ask for the spices and garlic on top. Crusty on the outside and seared to perfection and made as you wish, I had mine medium-well and it was perfect.  Get the Monte Carlo potato,  the best double-baked potato there is between here and Idaho. The coleslaw, the pickles, the bread, all of it outstanding.Both of us somehow managed to still have some space left for dessert, I had the classic chocolate cake and my friend had the creme brulee. There was not a note out of place anywhere.Moishe's has quite the reputation, while service is brisk, I'm happy that we ended up with a nice waiter. Nothing can turn a meal sour faster than a server with attitude. We ended up with the worst table, right by the door and kitchen but at least it gave us a great view of what was going on in the rest of the dining room and watch who else was strolling in. People say that Moishe's is a fancy dress place. Honestly, I didn't see that much class on display. I saw some real slobs walk in, t-shirts hanging out of jeans, social X-rays and ahem, "ladies of the night", escorts with businessmen and guys who looked like frat boys. The noise level is very high indeed. I have to say watching the parade of people on display is a bit like watching a show, quite colorful and quite the experience.My friend and I decided that we'll come back if at least to try out the rack of lamb.Seriously, just go.Went to Moishe's to try their friday/saturday after 9 menu + celebrate my 22nd birthday (Yay!)We had a reservation at 9:30 but weren't sat down until 9:50. The restaurant entrance was completely packed; guess we weren't the only ones trying to score a 30$ filet mignon.I ended up getting my filet only 30 minutes later (super quick service). The piece of meat was amazing although I would've appreciated a bit of seasoning on it. The Monte Carlo potato was simple and amazing- worth it for an extra 5$. Definitely would recommend to go try their after 9 worth it as the quality/price report is pretty good. However, if you're looking for a 4-5 star dining experience, you probably should stick to a decent dinner time as they seem to overbook the restaurant to really take every penny they can from this special. From what I have seen/experienced, Moishe's is a good traditional Montreal steakhouse and you should probably try it out at least once :)
Tex Mex 2=Hmm oh dear, how the great can fall. I came here for a wee birthday dinner with some friends as last time Emily V and I came we really enjoyed it.The food was still good, if in fact even better. I ordered the same combo platter of tuna with crab flautus and this time my tuna was actually rare as requested (if a little cold). And the margaritas are goooood. I do need to give them that.But the service left a lot to be desired. The waiter was friendly, and smiling, and seemed like a nice guy. But it was incredibly slow, at times bordering on arrogant, and very cheeky.I arrived 10 minutes early to find Emily V already early herself. Waiting for two others, we sat. And waited. We were one of two tables. I saw many members of staff wandering to and fro. The waiter didn't look busy. He never came over to our table but when I finally managed to catch his attention and ask "could we please order some drinks?" he responded with "yeah I'll be over in a bit" in a very nonchalent manner. "In a bit". Not a case of "oh yes I'll be over" whilst grabbing his note pad. It was literally a case of "I'm not yet taking drinks orders". A bit turned out to be 10 minutes.Fine during the meal itself, but when it came to paying we paid by cash. It was taken away, and not returned. We waited again. And waited. And saw him clearing tables, serving other people, still no change. Eventually, the polite Brit in me overcame my anxiety of appearing rude myself and asked for the change, to which he brought it over straight away. This makes me think he was hoping we wouldn't ask for the change and leave the in excess of 20% change as tip. Which was really quite ironic considering how slow and nonchalent the service had been.It was also quite cold in the restaurant when we first got there and I didn't take my jacket off until the mains arrived. A small note but when you're eating hot, spicy mexican food you kind of want to feel hot and spicy not shivering.Now I don't know if I would go back. Their margaritas really are sooooo good and great value. I like I said the staff were nice, not flat out rude, but their attitude of 'serving us when it suited them' and the very cheeky trick with the change put me off slightly.
Red Sushi Hibachi Grill=UN-FRICKEN-BELIEVABLE!!!!!Can I please get a ZERO stars option? Please?I am certain if you look back at all my reviews you will read somewhere where I boasted:     "There is no such thing as bad sushi!"      Well, guess what? -- we have found BAD sushi! Red Sushi Hibachi Grill has, was I would gently refer to, as the the "Worst Sushi on Planet Earth!"    No - "WORST SUSHI IN THE GALAXY!!"These people do not even pretend they are not terrible. The discerning look of utter disinterest on the face of my sushi chef, as he watched me scrape the layer of wasabi paste from the bottom of my fish and picked away at the mountain still on top of my rice, spoke volumes about this joke of a sushi bar. I was nearly floored by how he caked on the wasabi like a bricklayer building a wall.Of course it wasn't until I finished, with my 10 minute chore of scraping the wasabi from my fish, that I realized I should have kept it on. The Fish Was Nasty!  Let me say that again:     THE FISH WAS "DRAGGED THROUGH THE CRACK OF SOME DISHWASHER'S ARSE" NASTY! I was starting to wish I ate just the wasabi.I am so flabbergasted by the pure crap of this disgusting tourist trap, that I literally had a coronary when the bill arrived. At the bequest of my doctor, I am not supposed to go into detail about the bill - he fears it may kill me to talk about it again.      Uuuhh, my chest!   If you want to know what sushi DOES NOT taste like? - go to Red.   If you want to experience the "worst of the Worst"? - go to Red.   If you want to imagine Nobu Matsuhisa going Kamikaze on some place? - go to Red.   If you want Dishwasher Arse dragged over your tongue? go to Red.   If you want to know what it is like to hit Absolute Bottom? - go to Red.   If you are the absolute dumbest person on the planet? - don't go to red (I was being facetious before).   If you want to have your stomach pumped by a fat, bald intern with BO? - go to Red,Will somebody please do the world a favor, and invite Bruce Banner to have sushi at Red? -- Please? -- Someone? -- Please? -- Anyone?  --  For the love of Mike!P.S. If anyone is particularly good at Memory Charms, I am willing to pay.
Moe's Casse Croute Du Coin=You're not coming here for the service or food. You come here because you're drunk or hungover and need some greasy grub to fill your tummy. This place does that and then some.And at 4 am this place is a sure bet compared to most late night eateries in this city. Please note I have never eaten here sober, not because I have a drinking problem but because I never had the urge to go hete unless I wss wasted.
Le Mas Des Oliviers=I can't believe I've probably walked by this place millions of times but never tried it until about a week ago.  It doesn't look like much from the street but inside a truly fantastic food experience awaits you.  The decor is cosy and the service is top notch.  Their focus is on French food and they do that well.When you sit down they bring you a plate of chorizo sausage, olives and carrots.   While the sausage is tasty don't fill up here because there is lots more to come!  To start we split a platter that included confit de canard, grilled shrimps, grilled mushrooms and fried calamari.  The calamari in particular were very well done.  They were crispy and cooked just right.  To add to that I ordered the duck in green peppercorn sauce.  The duck was well done and fell apart.  The sauce was a pleasant addition.  You could really taste the peppercorns and it was salted just right.  They also brought some fries to the table to be shared by everyone and those were quite good.I finished off the night with a chocolate lava cake.  This is one of my desserts so my expectations are always high when I order it.  Fortunately this one lived up to those expectations.  It was piping hot and they succeeded in leaving the interior uncooked.Portions are huge so come hungry or be prepared to share with your dining companions.  As for reservations they don't seem an absolute must.  While it was busy when I came you probably could have gotten a table without a reservation.
Tomi Chinese Restaurant=Was it the stinky, dimly lit Taiwanese place we were looking for?Nope.Was it surprisingly elegant, well staffed, and one of the better Chinese meals I've had out since moving to Charlotte?Ya!At first glance, the menu looks un-friendly to us veggies, but that is not the case. Any prep that can be done with tofu is available (and this is almost all of them). My Blackish Tofu (beef, on the menu) was good - oily prep, lots of dried red pepper flakes, some mushrooms and carrots thrown into the mix (plus bamboo shoots, odd). Tasty. Veg Tempura is not what we were expecting - somewhere between a pakora and..well...something, it was good, if a smallish serving for $6.If you come here knowing what you want, how to pronounce it in Mandarin, and they have the stuff in the kitchen to accommodate ya, they will - a table pal had what looked like a glutinous-rice omelette, shrimpys abounding. Neat. Makes me want to learn a second language.
Mums=Mums does exactly what it says on the tin. On the menu it states that, "We believe 'gourmet' can and should be for everyone... and value prices should never be an excuse to use inferior ingredients or to serve up microscopic portions, we know you know better and so do we."Love that. And that's just what they do.We came for breakfast and got a heart y breakfast. My gal got a solid portion of Eggs Bennedict and I got pancaked with tons of streaky bacon, and they both were tasty and cheap.Service was a little slow and we did wait to get in, but it was fine and we still made our Edinburgh Fringe show with plenty of time. It's never going to be gourmet but they know that and they do that well. Recommended.
Restaurant Tibetan Om=My family and I had such a great experience at Om for our first Tibetan meal. While we've eaten plenty of Indian food, we were at a loss for what Tibetan food to order. Thankfully, Tashi our waitress was more than happy to assist us with order. Staff was very amicable and food was outstanding. Put Om on your list if you are looking for great Tibetan food. We will be back next time we are visiting Montreal.
Jackalope Jacks=First of, let me clarify... this is an one incident bad enough to warrant its own 1-star (if I can give zero, I would) review.After the Yelpy Award night, a few of us decided to get a bite and a drink to keep the party going.  It was about 10pm when we arrived, not late by any means for a bar.  We ordered food and drinks.  We were aware that our waitress is new (3 day old).  The service was a little slow, but what the heck, we're having a good time talking.  Then it dawned on us that it's REALLY REALLY SLOW.  As in 45, 50 minutes later we still haven't had food, and the waitress had barely came by. The place was virtually empty.  It doesn't take almost an hour to fix a few sandwich wraps and fries.  Plus people don't order food at 10pm unless they are just-got-out-of-prison hungry!  We started to voice out loud our frustration, I mean, last I checked I'm in the US and I have the freedom of speech to say whatever the heck I want as long as I don't scream "Fire!" in a crowded theater (I know I learned something in school...).  There was another waitress out on the patio doing clean up work.  And before we knew it, she HUFFED and PUFFED right by us and said LOUD ENOUGH for us to hear "F$#K, YALL ARE KILLING ME"I am not sure which school of waitressing this chick came from, but I'm damn sure that's unacceptable at anywhere.  And boy she picked the wrong table to F with... a table full of Yelpers?!  We eat for a living and we sure as heck have an opinion and the whole darn world is going to hear about it. Man, I was pissed... this chick done got my neck-twisting, finger-snapping side out of me.A NOTE TO MANAGEMENT (if you are reading): 1. Please tell your waitresses to NEVER be so rude to your customers. NEVER, no exception, even if the customer was rude (which we weren't).  I waited tables, so I had rude customers, go b!tch in the kitchen.  2. Keep your tables informed if there's some unusual wait time.  How the heck would we know you had a big take-out order if you don't tell us?  Let us decide if we want to wait (thus forfeit our right to complain) or not wait.  3. The F word is to be never used at any table for any reason whatsoever by your staff!    This is one of my fav spots in town, and it was such a disappointment to have to encounter this myself (on an empty Wednesday night to say the least).  I have sticked my neck out plenty of times for this place, and now I can't even use my usual line "I never had bad service here, ever" anymore
The Pita Pit=The Pita Pit is smaller and somehow feels grungier than the just steps away Pita Factory. The prices are about the same and the pita ingredients are pretty similar too.This place definitely services the post bar crowd, especially those coming out of Caesar Martini's at the end of the night since it's right across the parking lot.I dunno, over all this place gets a big fat 'meh' from me.I have never been in Pita Pit, but Carnegie Mellon catered Pita Pit in for some kind of speaker one day.  I didn't attend the speaker, but there was remaining free food.  Score.I had a gyro pita and some kind of steak pita.  The gyro one was definitely better.  A few reviewers have said this is healthy, but I don't think these are really "healthy."  They're healthy like Subway is healthy, you know?  The veggies were crisp and fresh, and the wraps were a great size.  I have no idea what the cost was so this review is strictly on taste.Would I trek over to the store to get the pitas on my own time?  Probably not.  But Pita Pit is good for a catered lunch if you need that kind of thing.
Shakey Jake's=Blah. Always excited to try new south side fair I headed in on Friday, the place was dead and the TV's were blaring. I ordered the pulled pork sandwich and waited about 30 minutes for my order and it was horrible. The pork was fatty and dry and they tried to disguise it by adding a gallon of BBQ sauce on top. The sauce itself was too sweet and the side of beans tasted like chili. Overall it was barely edible. The tables were sticky and needed a serious wipe down. Hopefully the service and food improves with age.
Bellagio Ristorante=This restaurant is rather delightful. While there seemed to be some backlog at the entryway, the general decor and ambiance makes this establishment feel classy. The tables are done well, the waiters (I decline to use the word 'servers' here on purpose) are attentive, and cooperative - this translates to better table side service.The wine menu is pleasant, and they serve free bruschetta. Their bread is also really soft, and served warm - pretty decent table balsamic vinegar. We both ordered pasta, and again, while the service time was a bit long (20 mins for a main dish), we were distracted by the appetizers. The restaurant also delivers on menu ingredients as listed for the dishes (lots of clams, bacon/ham, mushrooms, etc - none of the pretentiousness followed by a paltry portion). The dessert is accompanied with fruit and other sundries. No returned dishes, and well informed staff.In all, it was a great experience. For as large and well maintained an area, it was largely empty for a late Friday night dinner, but at about $50/person, the service is rather impeccable!
T&T - Tacos and Tequila=One of the worst Happy Hours in Vegas...or anywhere for that matter! We were tempted by this HH because it starts at 2:00pm and we had some time to kill waiting for friends to arrive in town. The bartender was pleasant enough. The $5 drink menu is very limited...sangria, shots of Jose, beer, well drinks (What Mexican restaurant HH does not include a HH margarita??? Apparently only this one...LAME!) The $5 food menu is also pretty limited. While we were deciding what to order we munched on some chips and salsa. We ordered the hot wings, nachos and two rum and cokes, because I don't do shots of Jose and THERE WAS NO HH MARGARITA...super lame. The drinks were small but the chips and salsa are really good. Here is the lowdown on the food:Hot Wings $5 - 3 sad little breaded wings. They looked and tasted like standard frozen industrial wings from Costco. Did I mention there were only 3 wings...for $5??? WTF?Nachos $5 - Ugh..how can you ruin nachos? A very small bowl of chips, covered in a tasteless black bean paste (I will let you use your imagination about what this dark, black paste looked like) and an orange substance that tasted like cheese in a can. The topping was sparse and only covered the top layer of chips, which I guess is a good thing because it was vile. I have honestly had better nachos from AM/PM. These were borderline disgusting and after two chips I had to stop eating them.This happy hour failed to make me happy, and actually made me a little sad and angry. HH FAIL!!!AVOID! AVOID! AVOID!T & T! It's dynamite! T & T! It tastes so right! T & T! Gives me a power load! T & T! Watch my butt explode!Bad AC/DC sample aside, Tacos & Tequila (T & T) is actually pretty good even though it's ridiculously overpriced even by Las Vegas standards. Seriously, this city will use any opportunity to overcharge you. On my last trip, they charged me 33 percent more for an escort because she had two legs and most of her teeth. Kidding. No really, I am kidding.When my 11 day work trip to Las Vegas bled into the fifth day (and into the weekend), I needed to unwind a bit by watching the first round of the NFL playoffs in a sports bar environment. I had passed by this joint on the way to work a few times, so I gave it a shot. Luckily, it filled the bill (in more ways than one).I walked up and asked for a table for one near a screen. Quickly, two pretty hostesses greeted me and sat me at the bar in front of some nice high definition screens. The bartender immediately put some chips and salsa in front me, asked if I wanted a drink, and presented the menu to me. Without question, the service at "T&T" is dynamite.Bad joke aside, the food is also awesome. My order was promptly taken and soon enough I was munching on some awesome chips and salsa, sipping on a drink, and high fiving sports fans around me. Eventually, my order came out with 4 tacos of various meats with melted cheese on top. They were freakin' delicious. The price is a bit steep for food and/or drinks. But then again, the more you drink, the better it all tastes, and the less price seems to matter. Remember, when it doesn't matter how much the drinks cost, it's always happy hour.Quite the attraction notwithstanding location. We were hungry and my feet were starting to bother me so we headed up to the escalator for some fish tacos.The menu was full of choices for burritos, enchiladas, and of course tacos.  I still asked the waiter if he would not mind changing it up for me for some grilled mahi mahi vs. fried fish tacos. I also asked him if they would put it on corn tortillas instead of flour. He most graciously said yes!  The fish was fine, and they put some sort of coleslaw on top, black beans with cojita type cheese on the side (yay no yellow cheese on anything) and the gratuitious orange colored rice. You get green and red salsa with chips. The salsas did have some nice flavor/spice to them.The menu also had some fun foo foo drinks but we were slowing down a little and ordered ourselves some coronoas instead.Prices were reasonable as well. Tit for tat it was a decent enough place for the neighborhood.Delish Cheese Enchilada & Chili Relleno with a Berry FinishSITREPWhile we were waiting to hit the clubs inside the LUXOR, my buddies Chris, Tkiller and I decided to hit T&T because, dam if we weren't already hungry, and we didn't want to wait on what we heard were going to be "gratuitous hoer'dorves" which would probably be snatched up fast if anything.THE SETUPT&T has a prime location right on the 2nd Floor store mezzanine level of the Luxor Pyramid, right as you get off the escalator in fact.  Since I guess everyone is hitting buffets in Vegas, there actually was NO LINE at this delicious boutique Mexican Restaurant, and so we grabbed the opportunity.THE MENUI'm all about enchiladas to be honest.  In fact, a cheese enchilada & chili relleno combo - with accompanying beans & rice - is my personal litmus test on how well I rate a Mexican restaurant and whether I will be back.  Let's just say that if I get to Vegas again and am in the mood for Mexican, I WILL be back here!THE FOODThe enchilada was absolutely delectable with a spicy mole sauce.  And the chili relleno was actually BIG & CRISP in it's battered shell and full of cheeses.  I was in heaven on this count.  But it got better because the refried beans were great, and mixed with the Mexican rice, and added salsa fresca and cheese salsa, made for a most excellent chip dip.  [And yes, I got quite full.]MARGARITASThe berry margaritas were outstanding, and in fact I got two.  Nice & limy tart but fully flavorful for all tastebuds and still with a bit of berry sweetness (mostly blueberry).  The damage for me was about $40, with the two berry margaritas actually more than the meal, but hey, it's Vegas.AMBIANCEThis is an open air restaurant in the midst of the Luxor Mezzanine, so there is quite a bit of white noise from the different areas of the hotel & casino activities that filter this way, especially with shoppers blitzing all around and conversing since this is the shopping level as well, and no sound barriers (no walls, no screens, no glass, etc.).  But once you get acclimated to that din, you don't notice it after awhile, and though I know some peeps are very particular about barriers, I'll make a point of noting that but am not going to deduct a rating when I'm really about the FOOD and the DRINKS.CUSTOMER SERVICEProps to our server and our hostess.  Absolutely darling gals - which got the *FLIRT* quotient on our experience there quite high with us guys.  But on top of that, Chris' droid and my iPhone were DYING and the gals let us charge up at their hostess stand, which apparently had a boatload of outlets all around it.  Bless them!And I will admit that for a HOTEL restaurant (as opposed to a stand-alone restaurant venue), this was quite an outstanding experience!THE LOWDOWNOne of the best Mexican restaurants I've been too, and actually the best one I've hit in Vegas.During my weird Vegas trip, none of my friends ate a meal together. I was the only foodie and everyone just fended for fast food between drinks. I wanted quick meal in the hotel (Luxor), but still wanted to be able to sit down so I ended up at Tacos and Tequila. I was in and out within 40 minutes which was pretty sweet.It would not be fair to compare a taco in Vegas to the tacos I eat in California, but naturally I still strayed that route. It's not the same as Mexican food in California, but it's decent if you need a taco or tequila fix. Complimentary Chips with Two Salsas - The chips were a little thick. I like fresh fried thick and crispy or thin corn chips, but I'm not a big fan of the in between tortilla chip where it's a little thicker and really hard but not too crispy. This was an in between chip. The salsas were fine, they gave a red and a green salsa. #1 Alambre Taco Plate (Grilled Steak, Bacon, Chile Poblano, Onion, Cilantro, Oaxacan Cheese on Flour Tortilla) - It says on their menu that this is their #1 item and looking at their other offerings, I would agree. The taco is full of diced steak and bacon with a mild kick to it from the poblano chile. The flour tortilla was rolled thin so that was a positive surprise (I like thin vs. doughy). The plate came with rice and beans and this is where it went wrong. The black beans were good, but the rice was undercooked and gritty. Rice is the filler item and it's not hard to get right.  C'mon man! If you are craving some beef tacos, I recommend getting Alembre tacos, either a la carte or as a taco plate. Let's just hope your rice turns out better than mine were.Service was good. I sat at the bar and they were fast with the water, chips and salsa and they did check on me after I received my food. They have flat screens with sports on in the bar area and they can fit sizable parties at the tables. Comparing to the other mid-range restaurants at the Luxor, T&T - Tacos and Tequila is probably one of your safer bets.In Vegas we stayed at the Luxor so we wanted to grab lunch somewhere convenient. T & T's is located inside the hotel up the escalator near the check in lobby. The lights are very dim up there but the seating area is nice.  It's kind of a romantic setting. They have a couple tvs where the bar area is. We were seated right away and our server stopped in to take drink orders. With checking into hotel we received a coupon for a free Margarita so we ordered one with waters. (We had already been drinking a bit so water sounded good) You can't mess up water, right? Well this was seriously the worst tasting water I have ever had. It tasted like toilet water and I haven't tasted toilet water before, but it was worse than tap. We didn't even drink it.They started us off with chips and salsa. I enjoyed the chips which were pretty thick.I actually enjoyed them better than thin chips. Salsa had good flavor too. I ordered two chicken tacos which came with rice and beans. The tacos had a little kick to it but I felt needed more cheese or lettuce. It was missing something. Rice and beans were okay, nothing special. It's a cool spot if you want to get some quick food in the hotel that isn't fast food.
Floyd's Kitchen=I think with time this place will be pretty awesome! The food was pretty good for the most part and the service was great and extremely friendly. We went on a Friday night and the place was packed with what seemed like very happy diners. Highlights.. the pot roast was better then my mothers, ask for horseradish. The lamp chop special was great and a super bargain at 18 bucks. The hummus was really good but the pita was a problem, was very hard. Though I told the server and he brought out a fresh batch right away, was good.All in all this place is going to be decent after they work out a few kinks in the kitchen. Considering that they have never opened a restaurant before I think that they are doing a pretty good job though they need to QC the kitchen more.FYI, 18 bucks is the most expensive thing on the menu though most itms are 12 and under.. seriosuly cheap eats!yjeir desserts are great!get the meatloaf when it is on special!
Boneheads=Ah, I hate to write this... But they switched their calamari. What use to be awesome, perfectly seasoned calamari appetizer is now bland over breaded rings. I even returned my order. Boneheads, please switch it back! Love, a calamari regular.
Franks A Lot=I made a solemn promise to my Yelp buddy, lain b., that I would give Franks Alot a try this week...well, it wasn't so much a solemn promise as more of a "if I happen to be in the neighborhood at lunchtime I will try to get by"...happily for me, it all worked out today:)I had the traditional Power Yoga class at the Village today (the class was brutal today...with a capital "BRU"... but I toughed it out:)After class, I needed something...something...what can retox your system any better than that big dose of unidentifiable beef parts that are first ground into a slurry and then soaked in nitrates that I like to call a "Vienna All Beef Wiener":)???Almost nothing, that's what (with the possible exception of unblended, 24 year old, highland malt scotch whiskey...but I am still working this afternoon...so hot dog it is:)I motored down 40th, past LGO, I saw the Chicago Hamburger sign beckoning off to my right, all wanting my business, all tasty and singing to me as I passed by, but I pressed on to my goal!I was almost on the runways at Sky Harbor before I finally found this place...it's a long way down 40th:)I don't get to this part of town very often...not really much for me to do here, but even though it's a schlep, I can see it becoming a hot dog destination.From first glance, you can tell that Franks Alot is a hot dog joint...drive through or walk up...cash only sign...no inside seating (although it was nice eating on the covered patio with the misters going and classic rock over the acoustically impaired speakers...made me feel like I was 17 again and sitting outside at Luke's in Monmouth...right down to "Spirit in Sky" warbling away at me:)I gotta agree with lain...Franks Alot makes a good hot dog!I had 2 foot longs, just to see what these wieners are made of (oh wait...I remember now...beef parts slurry, etc...see above:)They steam the Vienna All Beef Wieners (I just like writing wiener as often as possible:), serve them in warm fluffy poppy seed buns (I don't have to worry about the drug tests...drug use is encouraged for software developers:)...they have celery salt to sprinkle on your wiener (insert joke here:) which is almost always worth a star!They've got a lot (probably where the name comes from) of different sausages at Franks Alot...the special today was a polish sausage, and they have brats, red hots, etc.They do chili dogs, Chicago style, bacon wrapped...you know...all the healthy options:)I might even try one of those variations one of these days.But for now, I'm happy with the good old standby...the foot long hot dogs!$8.55 for 2 foot longs and barrel of diet coke...that's more than $3.00 less than Ted's for the same thing...and I didn't have to wait in line for 45 minutes:)guessing, we've all, seen those signsvienna beef, a thousand timessun bright yellow, big blue Vweiners from, windy cityserve 'em down at,  Franks A-Lotfortieth, washington's, gota dog house on, east side of streetsells dogs, even, mike vick can't beator any of the, weiner vendorscostco dogs? return to senderyelpers  yap 'bout,  tempe's Tedschicago's Lukes, i'm here, insteaddrives too far, wait's too longinching towards, a Franks, foot longhot dog man, I'm barking loudi give Franks a big, bow WOWwhile relishing, a spicy polish poppy bun, mustard, you know itneeds onions and celery saltpicnic tables, diners halttheir day, to dig a dogor drive thru, if they don't have longto sit and watch, the world pass bylight rail, semis, homeless guyshopping cart, pushed it pastcaught my eye, stopped and askedif i could, maybe, spare a fewtwo twenty-five, bought his lunch, toocooped, inside, since '88cooks,  cashier, crammed in a space'bout the size, of my closetnot sure, really, how Franks, does itphilly steaks, burgers toomore than, vienna, waits for youso if you crave, a great frankfurteryou don't need to, drive no furtherthan this little, hot dog standthanks Franks,  A-Lot,  you dah man
Won Mi=Craving good Korean food, we decide to try out a newer place.  We've been driving by the Won Mi sign every time we're on Spring Mountain, so with a party of three, we figure we'd get a chance to try a few more dishes.Saturday evening, and we're the only customers.  Not exactly the best sign, but we're not dissuaded.  Workers are watching something on the TV, but get us to a table and provide some menus.With some help from the waitress, we put our order in and the banchan arrives.  About eight different kinds arrive on the table and we start digging in.  Now, this was some pretty good stuff.  They had bean sprouts, cabbage kimchee, eggplant, cucumbers, seaweed, potato, daikon, and spinach.  All of it was REALLY good and we definitely requested more of everything.* Dolsut Bibim Bap (Bibimbap in a Hot Stone Pot" ($12.99) - The Husband and friend thought it was good, but could be better.* So Bul Go Gi "Grilled Beef" ($18.99) - We all agreed this was really good, tasty and done well.  Served on onions.* Korean Spicy Tofu Soup - Not on the menu, but typical at every Korean restaurant.I'll admit, I mostly focused on the good banchan and the bulgogi, I didn't eat too much of the bibimbap or the soup.I was telling the Husband that this place would be the bomb if they served up shikye too.  (Especially since we noticed that  not many Korean restaurants in Vegas serve this simple complimentary dessert.)When the bill arrived, we asked the waitress if they had shikye.  She was surprised that we wanted it, but yes, they definitely did have it!  When she brought it out, she did say it wasn't that cold yet since they were just making it.  (We were just happy to have it!)Yes, service is a bit slow, only because the staff is either engrossed in the TV or in the back.  But it's not hard to get their attention for more ice cold bori cha when necessary.  The waitress even chatted it up with us for awhile too, which was a nice personal touch.  We'll probably be going back again.Total: $50, including tip and tax.Lunch specials from 11 am to 3 pm.
Le Baobab=Joli café plein de Hipsters. Belle atmosphère jeune et dynamique de ce coin de Verdun. Décor vieillot mais branché. Absolument rien à envier au plateau. Petite terrasse sur le trottoir avant. Beau et bon capuccino  servi avec le sourire.  Semble y avoir une belle équipe. Très bon choix de sandwichs dont certains peuvent être coupés de moitié si trop gros pour vous. Choisissez parmi l'une des belles salades maison pour accompagner votre sandwich. Prix raisonnable. Malheureusement pas de wifi disponible.
Deli Planet=Look...up in the sky...it's a bird...it's a plane...it's...it's...Deli Man!!!Who?Yeah exactly...Deli Man is the superhero that welcomes you to this mess of a fast food joint in Montreal's Deli Planet restaurant.Picture Applebees minus the bad food. Yes it is that bad!Now granted, the location I visited was directly below my hotel. In Montreal they have an Underground City, which comes in handy when the weather is bad outside. Oh and it was bad. On a -30 degree day in this beautiful city I went underground and came across this happy looking place.I was in the mood for bad food. By "bad", I mean "greasy,cheese filled and fun" food...not "wtf is this?" food.Anyways here is what I ordered:Appetizer: Nachos Macho. Yes that is what it is called. No I did not call it that to the waiter. I hate places that give their food items stupid names, I am not saying "fruity tooty fresh and fruity" at IHOP and I will not say "Moons over My Hammy" at Denny's! Just say pancaked or scrambled eggs dammit!Oh yeah back to my review...now while I love my nachos...but this big bowl of chips with melted cheese, salsa, sour cream and jalapeno was just a big bowl of yuck. It came out cold and the chips tasted stale. I told them that the chips were cold, they offered to "warm" them up. Really? Are you going to nuke this mess and bring back a Nachos Macho Soup? I said I was not happy with this and they just stood there with a blank stare. I said I would not pay for this and the guy just walked away. Ha!?Main Course: Ordered the BBQ chicken. Meh...not going to say it was the worse chicken ever...but it surely was not tasty. Maybe because they gave me a side of mashed potatoes and the genius in the back poured mounds  and mounds of gravy all over my plate. I mean I love gravy, but this was ridiculous. Besides my gravy pool being everywhere, it was not even that good.I skipped dessert (shocked?)...and paid my bill, minus the nacho chips. Told the woman at the front counter on my way out that I was not happy with them and to look at my table (which was in view) and said that they were still there untouched. She agreed...I paid...and left this joint.Au Revoir.
Laurel Market=My co-worker and I came here for lunch today. I ordered the mercado sandwich with no bacon plus avocado on focaccia. The sandwich was in a word- perfection! That and an old-fashion style root-beer ran me $7 - well worth it! The sandwich was huge - but it was so tasty I tried to eat my second half ( although I was not successful!). The place is small but we didn't run into any crowds at noon. The service was fairly fast and friendly! There was not a place to eat the sandwich (my reason for 4 stars not 5)...who wants to eat at work ? ...They also close at 3pm so beware if you're craving a late afternoon Laurel Market snack. I will absolutely be back again very soon!
U.S. Egg=So good. Oh so good. So good for a hangover, or, so good for brunch with mom. Quaint little establishment with cute little waitresses bouncing around in tiny little shorts. My coffee cup was never empty, and even as I was leaving, my waitress was filling up my to-go coffee cup..  she gets my vote for the most wonderful person of the day. Their breakfast menu was pretty excellent, I got the Western scramble with mushrooms and it was cheesy delicious excellence. Very clean, and lots of seating.. I had read about the lines, but we got right in and right out. This place is exactly like The Good Egg.. but not as many senior citizens or bonnet wearing geese used as the decor.. I am a fan.Katy Perry ought to do the commercial for this place:U. S. Egg girls, they're just unstoppable,Daisy dukes and pancakes on top. . .More about that in a minute.  First, I'll talk about the food.  This is the first restaurant we went to when my family first rolled into Phoenix.  While their famous "protein pancakes" weren't my taste, I'm a big fan of their regular pancakes and think that theirs are about some of the best I've had.  Fluffy and tasty, they really hit the spot.And of course, the eggs.  At many places like IHOP or Denny's, you often get scrambled eggs cooked in this weird-tasting grease that leaves you with a burning sensation on your tongue.  At U.S. Egg, they're just tasty, and cooked in butter--delicious.  If you're looking for an opinion of their protein pancakes, just ask my wife.  She's really impressed by them and has ordered them on both occasions that we have visited.Okay, on to the customer service.  Another reviewer said below that "legs sell eggs", and he's right.  This is where my "daisy dukes" comment comes in--the servers are all women, and many wear shorts and brightly colored cosmetics.  Beyond their appearance, they tend to be nothing special, and sometimes aren't even particularly nice.  Getting their attention can be challenging.  Nothing horrendous here, but significant enough to dock a star.  Too bad--this would easily be a five star place if they really focused less on legs and more on helpfulness.If you are looking for a kick-ass breakfast, and don't mind some chilliness and a little bare skin from your server, U.S. Egg will do you right.  Sometimes there's a bit of a wait to get in--not surprising, and totally worth it!Well it is 12-12-12, a wonderful Day I think!!! Got up this morning and the coffee maker was not working.So we came here for breakfast. We have not been in a while so thought it is close we will go. Not too busy, and they have a very nice accomodating staff.We sat inside because, it is in the 50's this week(in the morning).Food is good , coffee is as well. You have to ask for Butter or else they will give you margarine.The water is tap water, so a lot of lemon will kill the taste of bitter and bad.Food is good I just wish they went more natural. Even all the jams are a bit gross.They cut corners here on certain things which really takes away from it all.Otherwise I would give them a 5 star.
Sens Asian Tapas & Sake Bar=I have this horrible affliction where I have to go to new restaurants when they open, I'm  very impatient. And I do this even though I know that newly opened restaurants inevitably have kinks to be worked out. I have been walking by Sens for months now and I've watched them put it together piece by piece and have been waiting for it to open. And what do you know, it opens the night of the Yelp party. Since I couldn't go to the opening, my husband and I decided to go on the second night. In reality this turned out much better because it was intimate and we were able to take a nice leisurely pace with the meal. Even the servers were saying it was better we came in when we did rather than for the opening since it was crazy and nobody really knew what was going on. I'm giving Sens 4 stars because yes, there are kinks to be worked out. I know that I will be there often given its proximity to my place and I fully anticipate giving it that 5th star once said kinks have been worked out. The Space- Think Asian diner/lounge. Yes, it is small, and the tables for two are not large enough to fit more than one plate at a time (slightly problematic for a place that serves small plates). There is a small lounge area off to the side which would make a really nice space for a semi private party. (They do take reservations, just call ahead). The bar and bar seating are definitely right in the main dining room. The Drinks- They sure know how to appeal to customers. We were offered complimentary shots of their infused drinks of blood orange sake (pass), pineapple sake (good), and lychee shochu (very good). My husband ordered a spicy mama, which had Thai chili infused shochu. My husband adores spicy drinks and this one really made him happy... reminded him exactly of the Thai chili martini that he gets at our favorite Thai place of all time in our hometown. The Food- There is nothing subtle about the food. Flavor is strong and very present. We chose four small plates, as we do in all small plate/tapas restaurants. We find four is always the perfect number. The first dish that arrived at the table was the clay pot lemongrass clams, which I would pass on in the future. The second dish was the volcano flamed beef which I would have to say was the best dish that we ordered, mainly because the flavors were the most subtle here- a little bit of peanut, a dash of mint. We did have 4 strips of steak and 2 lettuce wraps though, putting 2 strips of steak into one wrap was a bit much for me. The third dish was the seseme tofu which was very well cooked. Finally we finished with the ginger fish. When fish is cooked in a banana leaf it should absorb all the flavor from the cooking method, there was no reason for heaps of ginger to be placed on top of the fish. It was incredibly overwhelming. Our side of soba noodles were standard, even if they were delivered to our table after all of the other plates had arrived. They do not offer dessert so don't plan on having it there. The Service- All the servers were very friendly and engaging. They did feel the need to tell us how to eat every dish we ordered which I found annoying. I know there are a lot of people out there who have no clue but its best to ask us if we know how to cook our meat on the hot rock (sort of shabu shabu style). All in all I can see myself here often. The price is just right- the four small plates were more than enough to satisfy my husband and I for dinner and they came to $32 total. They do have kinks to be worked out and the food is not the best I've had but I am positive it will be part of our regular rotation.The food was pretty tasty, but it's definitely got a little bit of the "over the top" not quite "authentic" feel to it. Everything seemed just a little too commercialized to me which is why I gave it a 3 instead of a 4.Their Sake menu is reason enough to go back, but be prepared to spend a little. It is a tapas only, we ordered 6 tapas between two of us just to feel satisfied. The cheapest tapas on their menu are about 4 or 5 bucks, but there's only 2 or 3 things that are that cheap, and I think they were mostly the vegetarian tapas. Most of the tapas seemed to average out at about 7 bucks. So with sake and tip, you probably average out at about $40 a person. I would definitely suggest getting a side of rice to help fill your belly.They did an awesome job of atmosphere in the restaurant, and Johnny Chu came out several times to make sure we were enjoying our food. They also had a D.J. who did a great job of choosing GOOD music to play while we ate.  I'm just not sure that the timing was right for them, not very many people in downtown are quite ready for a place like this on a regular basis. Sadly, we were the only 2 people in the restaurant for about half of our meal at about 7:30 on a Friday night.I love sens a five star now. I would say that there was a complete turnaround in 2.5 months. Service issues are fixed, they pour a mean vodka tonic, the wasabi tofu has maintained its amazing tastiness and I really like the location.Now if only I could get someone to make sweet sweet love to me in the bathroom.So......... I'm pretty sure the bartender was wasted.Other than that I really enjoyed my experience here. The food was awesome and the drinks were strong. Any place with infused vodka(s) is alright in my book by default. It's just that I'm about 96.3% sure that the bartender was wayyysted. It was distracting. It seemed like the more we drank, the more fucked up she became (not to mention she kept "excusing herself for a moment" ahem..... ) sniff sniff?? one never knows..Anyway, everyone blowing Chu reminds me a lot of everyone blowing Bianco, which is a little annoying, but I do get it. He is an amazing chef and a very nice guy. I'm dying to go back on a night when I can really spend some time and try everything on the menu. Yes, everything... small plates people and this girl can put it down. One last thing.... after reading the last hand full of reviews, I don't recommend touching ANYTHING in that bathroom.I kidI kidOK, so I sort of promised Amber W that I wouldn't give Sens a bad review after a dining experience this weekend. 3 stars isn't bad, but it's not good either. First off, I have been here 4 times now and figure that is enough to judge. The place is cool, I will give it that. A new, hip downtown Asian tapas place. It's a small menu in an even smaller venue, but a place to be seen. The have a good beer selection and have my new favorite, a Japanese White Ale. It is really tasty. Dally enjoys the Hot n Dirty, which is a dirty martini with chili infused vodka. Lets just say it is an acquired taste. On this particular night they were able to accommodate a party of about 15 of us. That was great, it being such a small place. Here is where it goes south. We order. Our lovely waitress Morgan is kind enough to split everyones bill. I ordered some sort of sugar cane pork. I got it 1.5 hours later! Other diners food came out randomly, if at all. It was OK, but I am not really sure that is what it even was though. The other time I had food there it was a shrimp and pork dumpling which was very bland. The one thing I have had which is good are the fried wontons. Thanks Georgie! Overall it is a cool place. Take a date there who has never experienced downtown and it will impress her or him. Whichever. 3 stars for now. I will have to go back and give them another shot.I'm really torn on Sens. Great location. Great atmosphere. Great vibe. I get the idea of Asian tapas, but I felt like such a pig because, even though I snacked before we went, I was still hungry when we left. However, I must say that what we did eat was all very good. I ordered the Soup Gyozo (very tasty) and Thai Basil Clams (spicy goodness!). We also had the Spicy Wonton, which was phenomenal, and a few other items (which aren't coming to mind as I already started celebrating St. Patrick's Day). Their cocktails are inspiring and properly strong. I'll definitely return to Sens, but not on an empty stomach. Sorry, but I'm really a porker at times.Been here a few times now so it's time for the review.  Walked up to the hostess on a Saturday night and she asked if we had reservations, I said "no" because I didn't think this place was like that but then spending some time here it kinda makes sense, or Sens. Haha.So one time ended up getting 6 (maybe a few more but the beers were going down pretty easy that night) different items.  Each one well thought out and fun to eat.  Yes, I said fun. One was cooked by us on a hot rock, and the others made us investigate each tasty bite.Yup, the portions are small, but they're darn good vittles I tell ya.  Oh yeah, and they have a DJ so they get a few extra hipster points.to date, i have been to Sens twice now, oddly enough as a guest to two of the bartenders at the Turf. was drinking on a Saturday night when one of the bartenders who was off the clock was hanging out, asked if i wanted to head over to Sens and grab a bite to eat. i obviously said "Yes" so we walked across the hallway and up to the bar, it was 2:25 or so and the kitchen staff was cleaning up, she asked if the kitchen was closed or if they can still serve food, we got a nod of approval and quickly put in an order, two plates of the Duck+Mint+Ginger salad, an order of Soup Gyoza and Shu Mai. everything was excellent, the Duck salad is amazing 5 stars for sure. the dumplings were both excellent as well. the graciousness of bar waitress and the kitchen staff was amazing considering the time. second time eating at Sens, was not quite harmonious. i was asked previously to my first visit if i wanted to try sens, and while neither myself or the bartender requesting my presence had been here yet, i agreed and we agreed upon a time and date where she would be off work around the same time i would get home from work.  we headed over to Sens, now at this point I've already had some experience with the menu and the food, plus I'm not a stranger to asian food. this time i ordered the Soup Gyoza, Fried Tofu and the Sugar Cane, my accompaniment tried the Miso with shrimp.now this is where i cannot justify a 5th star....i received all 3 of my dishes before they even started her Miso soup. :(i held off eating while we both waited for her food, i offered some of my selections as it was enough to share and still be happy with it. but it still didn't put off the annoyance of not having your own dish in front of you. it was finally served a long 8 minutes later, roughly, and she liked it. only complaint beyond the delay was that the shrimp were a little overcooked.all in all good experiences for trying something fairly new. I'll certainly return, price wasn't all that bad and the drinks are pretty good. but nothing i would go there for strictly. I'm not a huge fan of sake or vodka. they do have other things to pore, but the drink specialties are all sake or vodka. :\Was it just an off night? I had high hopes for this place and was sorely disappointed. Went on a Monday and the place was dead. I know my fellow yelpers may stone me for this review but here goes:To start - I found the décor to look a bit cheesy, like design on a dime but they only spent a nickel.. What's up with the glass jars full of paper confetti? The music was too loud and the lights kept getting darker and darker, by the time we got our food we could barely see.Our waitress was nice and recommended her favorites. So many people have raved about this place, but I found the fusion either bland or overspiced. Shabu Hot and Sour was served first - This soup had no spice to it at all, even the side dipping sauce provided had no spice. The lime broth, while providing nice flavor to the veggies was too overpowering to eat, so we just picked out all the veggies. Spicy Wontons came out next - Chicken and pepper jack.. This tasted as though it had been frozen for ages, no flavor and very little amount of chicken.Volcano Beef - Nice touch on the "sear it yourself" hot rock. We could see the beef was marinated, but we couldn't taste it and the garnish accompanying it was loaded with too much ginger. At this point we were so disappointed with the food, and still hungry. We left and walked down the street to Moira, another disappointment. Review to follow.Dinner at Sens was, hands-down, one of the best meal-experiences we've had here in Phoenix. Four of us (2 couples) made reservations at Sens for 6:30 on a Saturday night. It was a good thing we had reservations, because shortly thereafter, the place was packed. Sens is not a place to grab a quick bite; rather, this is the place to go to use all of your senses (get it?) - taste, smell, see, hear ... the music was great, the lighting was nice, and the food was amazing. We started off with some drinks. I was intrigued by their infused Shochu ( a Japanese vodka). To start, I tried the lychee-infused Shochu with club soda. My friend also enjoyed the lychee Shochu but with club soda and a splash of cranberry juice, while her husband tried the logan Shochu chilled and straight up. My daring husband opted for the chili-infused Shochu, which was incredibly spicy. Not long thereafter, the waitress asked if he wanted it made into a martini, so he chose the "Hot and Dirty" (which was like a dirty martini, but made with the hot chili Shochu). Later, I tried the ginger-infused Shochu and the Lemongrass-infused Shochu. GREAT DRINKS! To eat, we dined like royalty on the following dishes:La Nho, lemongrass marinated beef wrapped in grape leaves.Volcano Flamed, thinly sliced beef seared on hot stone. The beef actually comes to the table raw, and you literally cook it for 40 seconds per side on a hot stone. Very cool.Shu Mai, wasabi pork and shrimp dumplings. Very tasty, with a kick!Papaya Mango Salad with shrimp in a lime vinegarette.Wasabi Soy chicken breast, marinated and served with rock salt wasabi.Lemongrass Soy chicken breast - this was probably my favorite dish!Spicy Wonton filled with sauteed chicken and pepperjack cheese.Red curry tofu - We ordered a side of steamed rice, which you really have to do in order to enjoy all of the amazing sauce in this claypot dish.and, finally, Quail seasoned with aromatic rock salt.I would order everything all over again. I loved that we got to try a little bit of everything, and we had such a fun time eating, chatting, drinking ... It was hard to leave! On a side note, I had the opportunity to chat with owner/executive chef Johnny Chu about the creation of Sens vs what's happening over at the restaurant-formerly-known-as-Fate. Johnny has taken the old Fate menu and infused it into the Sens lunch menu. He's also not involved with what used to be Fate (they are now calling it 905), so if you loved the old Fate, you need to find your way over to Sens!Okay, I will preface this review by saying, I was extremely hammered when I came here, so the level of awesomeness I remember may or may have not been altered by that fact. Either way, I REALLY liked this spot.I got cozy at the bar with my guest under the funky blue lighting and soon after was joined by the Executive chef, Johnny Chu. What a wonderful wonderful man. He spent a decent amount of time chatting with us, which was cool. He really is a prime example of why I absolutely adore chefs. The only thing I tried food wise was the Wasabi Tofu, which was really good, but watch out, the first bite is REALLY hot, in every way. Excellent drink selection, but like I said, I had already had enough.. thus I am looking forward to revisiting Sens in a more sober state, very very soon!I finally went to Sens and was not disappointed. It was like Asia. In San Francisco. In Phoenix.The hostess sat my lovely lady and I in a corner and it sooo made me want to make out, but it was our first date, and alas I am a perfect gentleman. We were in the room up front, right next to the garage door that isn't. Word is, they're gonna blow out the front of the restaurant to allow for outdoor seating as soon as Chu cuts down the giant 75 year-old palm tree out there. (Update: Palm tree is now gone. Green people shant fret, though. I mean, it's not like it was a 200 year-old Redwood or something. Besides ... upon hearing the news, I lit a candle and planted a baby ficus in my own back yard in memoriam. So that's kinda' like a carbon offset. Or something.)I could have sworn our server was Asian. Turns out she was Jewish. And awesome. Jinia (that's her awesome name) could tell I was having difficulty deciding (or perhaps she just grew impatient with me in her own sweet way), so she simply asked us our likes and dislikes, in general, and if we had any food allergies or intolerances, and she proceeded to make the decision(s) for us. It was great! And unless you're an experienced Sens patron and already know what you do and don't love, I'd highly recommend going this route. It was kinda' like chef's choice, except it was Jinia's choice.And Jinia did not disappoint. Since we weren't doing the ordering ourselves, I'm not even sure what all we had. But it was all tasty. And I love that the portions are what they are - tapas size - so it allows you to try many different things rather than simply ordering one giant entrée and being stuck with it, for better or worse. Among other things, I do know we had the Soup Gyoza and the Spicy Wontons. Oh ... and the Volcano Flamed was clever. (You get to sear your own beef carpaccio on a hot stone. I messed ours up and it turned out more like beef jerky, but that was my bad. I own that.) Also had a soup and a salad, the names of which both escape me however. The tea with the blooming flower was a pleasurable experience as well. Not only was the tea delish, but watching the blossom do its thing in the teapot was sorta' like watching one of those time-lapse nature videos back in middle school.The cucumber-infused hydro has ruined me for all other table water. About this I am upset. But overall it was a great dining experience, thanks to the good food and even better service. I will indeed be back once they finish the overhead door conversion and I can sit outside under the aberration of shade cast by the once present giant palm tree that is no longer. And make out.It has been a year-and-a-half since my last review update, and I still cannot get enough of Sens. I'm here at least 2-3 times a month, sometimes even twice a week!I really appreciate the love and dedication that Johnny puts into his craft. He cares about the quality and taste of every meal that comes out of his kitchen, the way his staff interacts with customers, and the overall ambiance of the restaurant. I think he has mastered this craft.Being a vegan I have a plethora of options, which makes me very happy! The mango papaya spring rolls are incredibly refreshing and pair well with the spicy peanut chili sauce, the wasabi tofu is a great crunchy and spicy transition into the incredibly flavorful Hong Kong Flat Rice (I add tofu) or Spicy Saigon with Tofu. Both dishes are loaded with snow peas, cauliflower, onions, and carrots and tons of flavorful sauce in a skillet with crunchy tofu.Another chart topper for me is the hot and sour soup with tofu. Try the sweet chili sauce that comes on the side for a sweet, spicy, and salty adventure! The red tofu curry is amazing as well. VERY filling. I'm a huge fan of the plain 'ol vodka tonic, but love that they infuse their own vodkas with a variety of things like chili's and lychee. Dallas G LOVES the "hot and dirty" and I am also a fan of the "Cucumber chill." Although I cannot drink beer anymore, the White Ale is a chart topper.They also have a great selection of Sake. I took part in their sake tasting last night and became a fan of several new sakes! We downed a bottle of Pure Dawn and were really excited to see the discount after partaking in the tasting! Bonus!Overall, Sens is definitely my favorite restaurant. The food, the drinks, the love.... and we know all of the waiter/tresses so it makes for an even better experience!PS... Still love the bathrooms ;-)The last time I was here I went with two female co-workers who were mildly obsessed with the idea of me dating our waiter. I'm no stranger to objectifying cute male wait staff (cough*Roka Akor*cough), but even I felt uncomfortable for him after he had to endure approximately 3 hours of merciless cougar flirting followed by loud encouragement for me to take a more active approach to my dating life by hitting on him. I felt like I was having dinner with my two pimps, but he was a total pro about it and it ended up being an incredible meal!I had been to Sens once before where I had the most amazing Pimm's Cup ever. I freaking love Pimm's Cups, and only a handful of places in Phoenix serve them, so when I get a good one, I remember it vividly (well, as vividly as i can remember things that occur on patios at 1:00 AM on a Saturday).  After going for dinner a few weeks ago, I had the same thing and it was just as good, even though I wasn't nearly as drunk as I was the first time. Since my BAC fluctuates like Kirstie Alley's waistline, that's about all the consistency I can ask for.We ordered a ton of food, which seems to mostly be served small-plate style with 4 or 5 servings per order. This is perfect for me, because I tend to get bored easily and after a few bites of the same thing, I'm ready for something else (this might explain why my co-workers feel the need to take control of my dating life).  Everything we ordered was fantastic! We started off with sizzling shrimp in a spicy red sauce. The shrimp was perfect and sauce was actually spicy. Nothing pisses me off more than when restaurants cater to the wimpy masses by having their "Spice-O-Meter" equivalent to that of a kindergartner with an ulcer. The soup gyoza, bacon wrapped dates, sugar cane pork, and bacon wrapped okra were all just as good.  For dessert we had bacon-wrapped lychees (bacon was clearly the theme of the evening) and it was pretty much the perfect conclusion to the fantastic meal.Even though I've only been to Sens twice, it's slowly creeping up my list of favorite restaurants in Phoenix and will probably only continue to climb as I visit more often. Maybe next time I won't bring my pimps (but no promises).Sens is, well, SENSational!I love tapas style of eating. And unlike yogurt and cupcakes, tapas, I think, is here to stay! Sharing food with friends is perhaps one of my all time favorite things to do. Some people like camping. Some people like How I Met My Mother. Others scrap booking. My gig? Friends. Food. Sharing. So we gathered here yesterday after enjoying fantastic cocktails and my favorite nachos at Bliss to have some serious food. I shared my two favorite things here, the SOUP DUMPLINGS...omg...omg...pounding fists on table...total mouthgasm. You know when you get the squirt of gooey cheese from the middle of pasta shell in your fave mac n cheese? This is so similar. Hot, salty broth exploding as you bite into tender pork and savory cabbage. Pure heaven! Really, who doesn't like things exploding in your mouth? My other love is the White Ginger fish, whitefish steamed with a soy ginger sauce. And I loves me some ginger. Even on Gilligan's Island, I was a Ginger man, not a Mary Ann. I mean really, pigtails?! Tender, mild and absolutely off the charts with some very enjoyable flavors.Miss for me on this visit were the Korean short ribs...ugh...flavor was there...just couldn't chew the damn things. Also on the dry side and simply just very pedestrian was the Wasabi Soy Chicken.But, with the fabulous company I had and the Asahi beer and the chilled sake, it still measured up to a four star evening. Service was great as well. Patient, good-natured waiter, took care of eight buzzed and chatty diners!So Sens...you get me. With your tapas style menu. Your downtown vibe. Chilled sake.And. The. Soup. Dumplings. SENSational indeed!
Tortas Paquime=¿Dónde es la peda?Over effing here.  I've only been here a few times but I love it!  I've had their quesadilla paquime, a few bites of my friend's ribeye tacos, their tortas cubana, and some other bites here and there.  Everything I've had here has always been fresh and flavorful and the portions are decent for their price.  As for their horchata... delicious and refreshing!Tortas Paquime is a casual dining spot that's always busy.  Don't forget to make a stop at their salsa bar.  They also have huge cases of baked pastries and a very impressive ice cream bar.  I have yet to try their sweets but they look pretty damn amazing.  The staff is friendly, the place is clean, and there's ample parking all around.  Thumbs up for yummy tortas!  ¡A huevo!Way out west, we're saturated with hit-or-miss little Mexican spots. Paquime is definitely a hit, specializing in sandwiches and desserts. So many kinds of desserts. First, I'd tried the chocolate chip ice cream. The consistency and richness of it lets you immediately know it's the real deal, and will be totally satisfying. I also tried the nuez or "nut" ice cream...I think it was pecan? I'm not sure. Could not be any more vague...it tasted to me like pancake syrup ice cream, which I didn't like, but my breakfast-loving dining companion fell in love with. After a few minutes, my quesadilla was ready (ha! I didn't even get a torta!). Instead of having precooked steak like a lot of the competition, it looked and tasted like it was made fresh to order. It was complete with tomato and avocado slices. I must admit it was a little skimpy--I ended up tasting everything *but* the cheese every other bite...but it was still tasting great, even if a bit on the small side. I'll update you when I actually try the main attraction here, a torta with fries. But until then just know that you're getting some good quality stuff for the price, and that even if you're just feeling pastries or ice cream, Paquime is still worth dropping by.
Au Pied de Cochon="Au Pied De Cochon" means "at the pig's foot," and they're known for their huge roasted pork leg dishes, but Chef Martin Picard should change the restaurant's name to something more appropriate. "At the Fountain of Foie Gras" or "At the Teats of Heaven." Well, they don't serve teats I think, but they do serve Christ's Ears -- "oreilles de Christ," a Quebecker sugar shack favorite of deep fried pork rinds smothered with maple syrup. PDC serves Quebecker food. Not French, not Canadian -- Quebecker. If all Quebecker food were as good as PDC fare, I would quickly die a very plump, very happy man.Plogue a Champlain. It deserves its own review. Calisse de crisse, this dish is mindblowing! Dessert? Breakfast? Appetizer? Entree?  I'll describe. Take half a lobe of fresh foie gras and pan sear it so that the outside is crusty, while the inside is still moist and springs back to the touch. Stack it atop brie, atop shredded potatoes, atop a buckwheat pancake garnished with two strips of locally grown bacon. Smother generously with real maple syrup. Put the dish in a fiery hot brick oven until you can't stand the wait anymore. Take it out. Take a bite. Now devour the rest. Okay, you can die now.The plogue alone is worth five stars. It's the best thing I've ever eaten. And I've had it many times since my life-changing first. I could stop at the plogue and never touch another menu item. But wait -- there's more! PDC's brick oven-baked pork chops with rosemary and white wine are the best pork chops I've ever had. I ordered the one-pounder (500g) thinking it would be far too much. To my deep regret, it was so good, I wish I had ordered their 2-pound (1kg) cut. More than enough meat for any man. But wait -- there's more! We haven't even touch the pig's foot!Yes, pork trotter -- pig's foot. Stuffed, braised, baked. It's amazingly, succulently, stupendously supple and tender and tasty. And it comes with or without foie gras stuffing. You can get foie gras with anything. You can get it atop poutines -- Quebec's quintessential dish of squeeky fresh cheese curds and fries drowned in hot gravy. You can get it by itself. You can try it for yourself. You can have foie gras and hams, Sam-I-Am.Every ingredient is from a local farmer. Everything is hand-made -- they even brew their own PDC beer. Every time I've gone, every person working there has been beyond gracious. Everything I've said above is why Au Pied De Cochon has been a smashing success since its opening in 2001. Make reservations, folks. I doubt they ever run out of pig's foots, but I know they run out of seating every night.PDC is world class. If the exchange rate weren't so hellish, I'd be there now, enjoying the marvelous Montreal summer and PDC -- the second best thing about Montreal.P.S. Please, please don't bring your vegetarian friends unless I'm there to laugh. =) Says Picard, "When you go to a restaurant to eat salad, you have a problem."P.P.S. #1? Les copines. ;)This was one of our favorite meals in Montreal. I love game meat, I love foie gras, et j'adore la cuisine Québécoise, so I was in heaven here. However, you should probably not go here and expect an elegant fine dining experience. It's pretty small, very crowded, and very loud, and has a very casual interior with wooden tables - it's not a place you necessarily need to get dressed up for. You definitely need a reservation if you don't want to stand waiting for hours; we had a reservation and got seated within about 15 minutes, but there were people who got there before us that were still waiting 2 hours later.  Despite the inventiveness of the menu and the relatively high prices, the food is not really haute cuisine per se. However, that does not make it any less delicious, in my opinion. The foie gras section on the menu has over 10 selections, but some of them make you go "whaa...?", like foie gras poutine and foie gras hamburger. The atmosphere is a lot like my favorite restaurant back home, which is not too fancy but just has really good food. The wine list was excellent with an extensive French selection. We started out with a bottle of Pouilly-Fuissé, but since the bottle we ordered was not available, the manager brought us out a Pommard he said was even better and was also less expensive, which was very nice. We started out with a plate of mixed pâté and some zucchini blossom tempura - the tempura was very light and pleasing. We moved on to two more delicious dishes, a tomato tartine and tarragon bison tongue. The tart was on this light fluffy pastry dough, and the bison tongue was extremely tasty. By that time we had moved on to a bottle of Old Vine Châteauneuf-du-Pape, also excellent. Our main course was the foie gras poutine - just had to do it - seared foie gras on top of fries, gravy, and cheese curds, and it was everything I thought it would be. I figured I was probably only going to have poutine once so it might was well be the most decadent. We finished things up with a dessert of maple churros, espresso and cognac. Afterwards the manager came by our table and brought us each a complimentary shot of Bushmills and drank it with us. It was just a really great experience.P.S. I read a quote about this place afterward that gave me a smile: "No animal is safe from his kitchen"Being Québecois I always have a soft spot for Cuisine du Terroire and without a doubt, Le Pied de Cochon is its Mecca. Martin Picard, the owner and chef of PDC has a penchant for my number favorite food stuff of all time: Foie Gras. His menu is littered with Foie Gras. The menu has items and then with added Foie Gras just to make it even better. Just with that he would score points with me. I was simply unprepared for the ways he presents Foie Gras and it changed everything.You're probably saying "Dave, you're going overboard here, Foie Gras is good but it's not life altering" to which I answer "Sit down, shut up and read on" because you obviously haven't been to PDC and have experienced what I have experienced. I'm sure it's the kind f elevating sensation those religious people experience during conversion.It started with The Cube or as the menu calls it Foie Gras Cromesquis. When your plate is presented the waiter has to give you some instruction first. He explains that it's a Foie Gras Terrine breaded and then deep fried. The terrine is now liquefied so you must wait a minute or two for it cool down and when you do bite down on it, keep your mouth closed. I looked at him with incredulous eyes. I take hold of the breaded cube, put it on my tongue and closed my mouth as the waiters behind the bar looked on, I bit down on it and then... time... stopped... My eyes closed and I wanted to say something but the Cromesquis exploded into a liquid spray of flavor napalm. At that very moment I could have died and it would have ok. This was only the beginning.I then continued this blissful expedition to culinary perdition with an off-menu item that was offered to us. Fried-Head cheese on a Gribiche sauce. The Head-Cheese was breaded with a smear of goat cheese on top and the Gribiche was just so good that I cleaned out the plate. The head cheese was so far beyond what I expected. The meat tastes so much stronger and is more diverse in flavors. Unbelievable and the best head-cheese I've ever had in my life.Did you think we we're done with entrée? Oh HELLLLL NO. Picard mixes Quebec's masterpiece of fast-food with Foie-Gras and turns into an orgasmatron of taste and sensation. Poutine with Foie Gras. Just the idea was mind-boggling and the execution was akin to sex with a very willing firm horny barely legal co-ed. I've had a lot of Foie Gras before but this was simply the most textured, flavored and fragrant one I ever tasted. I just wanted to bash my head on the bar it was so good.I ordered the restaurant's namesake dish, The Pied de Cochon. Pied de Cochon translated means Pig's Foot. And that's what it was. A whole pig's foot and some of the leg too. It was MASSIVE. The meat is removed braised and then stuffed back in the breaded leg with the hooves. It's layed on a bed of mashed potatoes then covered with a medley of tasty and very aromatic veggies, some of which I failed to Identify. Oh and yeah with a cherry on the top, another artery clogging portion of Foie Gras. The plates was enough to feed a family of rufees for a week and it was impossible for me to finish it but trust me that no meat was left on the plate, just the hooves and some veggies. Pig's leg is easily the tastiest part but it's work to get at sadly and probably explains why my mother only made Pig Leg Stew once a year.I decided to attack the desert menu. I quickly spotted Pudding Chômeur (poor mans pudding) I had to try Picard's take on this cultural institution. I was not dispointed, it was dessert heaven - though my mom's Pouding chômeur was light years beyond his - and a brilliant close on the evening.The service was top notch friendly and unpretentious. If you've ever seen Picard's show, he looks like a lumberjack, he's not anything like a snotty pedantic chef, he's all about good food and he'll go and kill it himself to get it on the plate. So his staff is equally relaxed and approachable. I'm not big on chi-chi restaurant experience and this restaurant looks like a sugar shack and is very laid back while still having 2000$ wine bottles on its wine list. Fine Dinning without the dickishness.Le Pied de Cochon is by far the best restaurant, culinary, eating experience I've ever had and I can't even begin to explain why. All of the above are mere ramblings of a mad man drugged by an experience that will not soon be overcome. I seriously doubt I can find another food experience to top my carnivorous proclivities anytime soon. Best Foie Gras ever, awesome head cheese, sublime Poutine, insane Pig's Feet. It took me about 3 days to come down from the rush. There is a God and his name is Martin Picard.Au Pied De Cochon isn't for the faint or weak. Not for the faint of stomach (think duck fat and pork), faint of heart (think duck fat, pork and your arteries) nor the faint of wallet (think duck fat, pork and a  reputable name that costs money to even utter).Call in your reservation weeks, even a month or so in advance. This is no walk-in spot. Please do not bring your squeamish friends here as they will not enjoy the experience, and you may not either. Also, do eat lightly the day of because this meal will consume and overtake your body, and also that part of your brain that controls  food comas. Our reservation was called in a couple of weeks in advance, and we got an 11pm block on a friday night.  We arrived and were seated immediately.  The restaurant itself isn't cabaret. No flashing lights or people in pig costumes. It blends with the surrounding establishments on its block, ninja-like if you aren't keeping a good look out. The ambiance is actually very casual, and upbeat. Oh and their piggy icon is very symbolic of this spot, a little bit comical, a lot fatty.We wanted to sample a lot of different things: two orders of the foie gras poutine, the infamous duck in a can, pied de cochon stuffed with foie gras, boudin maison, and côte de cochon heureux.The foie gras poutine was heaven on a plate. With every bite, I could hear angels trumpeting behind me. I scooped up the last bit of it with our complimentary bread. Never knew I could fall in love with something so alien to me. Duck in a can! Literally. It's quite a sight and very photo/vid worthy to catch them serving this up to you. Taste-wise, the amount of duck fat in there would make a roll of papertowels run away, but it ridiculously succulent.Stuffed pied de cochon swims underneath a rich, glorious brown gravy, if you're lucky, you'll find some semi crispy skin under there. I know I did. Boudin maison was a delectable porky tenderness as well, probably the more conservative of the dishes. Wasn't a fan the last dish on our list because there was just way too much blood sausage, which I have never been a fan of. To cap this artery-clogging feast, and about 1:30 am,  we got brazilian coffee. Hot, creamy and liquor-y.Unforgettable experience best saved for the brave.While most restaurants that I've been too in my various trips to Montreal have been generally very good, few have set a culinary standard that my visit to Au Pied de Cochon has. I had not been there on the two previous trips but after hearing even more hype about it, decided to make it happen last weekend while in Quebec. I had made a reservation almost two months before the date of the dinner and it was rather easy, done right over the phone. Just a day before the dinner, the restaurant called me to confirm it.I must admit that I had been looking forward to it for a while after salivating over the menu on their website. One thing that I did notice was how authentic it was; how well it reflected not just the local ingredients, but also the approach and tradition of the Province of Quebec. Anyone reading the menu should easily be able to determine the type of food that you'll be experience and in this case it's rather easy. It features dishes that are somewhat on the fatty but yet very tasty side, something that has helped the locals survive the harsh winters. Some of their proteins offered are bison, beef and also a lot of duck dishes as well. Duck as a matter of fact is their specialty - the culprit dish is duck in a can ($37): a duck breast, a piece of foie gras, some balsamic glaze, some garlic and some thyme, all sealed into a custom-labeled tin can and cooked to perfection. The dish is revealed tableside and is poured from the can and into your plate and the can placed onto the table next to your plate.  But enough on that and more about what I actually ordered and ate.After taking a good look at the categorized menu, whose dishes are sorted by protein-type, I decided, after much hesitation to get the assiette de cochonailles (pork charcuterie plate). It featured some pickled tongue, three large portions of delicious pâté, some headcheese, some pork sausage and even some aspic. On the plate were also half of a hardboiled egg and some corn salsa. At $9.50, it was probably the single greatest value I've ever seen and having eaten most of it, I was already almost full. Everything was great although I was not a big fan of the tongue that I found too pungent - The bread was perfectly toasted and I think that the highlight of the dish was the pâté which was out-of-this-world. Not having any idea as to the portion sizes, I was actually going to order more food as their starters seemed very appetizing and were very affordable - their zucchini blossoms ($6) and their foie gras croquemis ($3.50) caught my attention but the waiter told me that I had already enough food in my order, especially since my main course was going to be one of their specials, their lamb shank. Speaking of the lamb shank, it arrived shortly after and was cooked to perfection; it fell of the bone and was perfectly seasoned. That explained why they didn't upgrade my knife at the table while all six others at the table had been given steak knifes. I didn't need a knife at all; it was fork-tender and delicious. It was served on a bed of green lentils and at only $26, was a bargain considering the volume of the serving and the quality of the food. It was cooked confit-style and was had some tomato on top. It was all delicious and ever so tender, even the lentils were cooked perfectly. I could barely finish it all but somehow managed. In the process, I also sampled some of my friends dishes, as I stated earlier, including the duck in a can and the cassoulet. Both were very tasty dishes and the duck was very flavorful, picking up some of the foie gras flavors in the process. We did not have room for desserts but all left very satisfied from our food and drinks - Most of us ordered local beers, including their delicious 'Au Pied de Cochon' ale which is brewed in Quebec. It was light, came ice cold and paired well with our meal. The service and kitchen were a bit slow but the service was very, very efficient and although our meal lasted over two and a half hours, our time spent there was amazing. Our waiter even tracked and split our checks into seven individual tabs at the end of the meal which was both impressive and pretty awesome. Saved us from a math-induced headache.The décor is simple and the restaurant doesn't even have it's name in the front and yet it's warm and welcoming. The tables are a bit cramped and the restaurant isn't very wide, but you're able to use a self-serve coat check upon entering before being showed to your table. This restaurant is an absolute gem in a city which already has good food, it excels at reflecting the true colors of Quebec through its menu and dishes. Just remember though, reservations are a must, and should be done way ahead of time. I cannot wait to go back in the future and experience more of their food.Having read the rave reviews about  Au Pied de Cochon,I had high expectations before I even arrived. I`m pleased to say they weren't only met, they were exceeded! The atmosphere was lovely, the service fantastic and the food incredible. Five stars!To start, my friend and I shared the snails and the salami tray. I have to say the thought of eating snails grossed me out, but I reluctantly tried them. They were delicious. The brandy and BBQ in the sauce made the dish. The salami tray was predictably scrumptious.For my "high gear", I had the duck carpaccio This was possibly the best duck I've ever had. Even if you're not a huge duck  fan, I still think you should try it. The cream sauce drizzled over it was fantastic.I almost forgot to share my cocktail experience. You must get the Pom Pom! It`s got pomegranate juice, ginger and mint, to name a few ingredients. I also tried the Rosemary Pink Diamond Fuzz which was also very good. I had a sip of the Blue Mojito, but it was too sweet for my liking.Simply put, Au Pied de Cochon is superb. I can`t wait to go back.Un resto comme Au Pied de Cochon se passe de présentation. Ouvert depuis 2003 et situé sur la petite avenue Duluth, le restaurant du célèbre Martin Picard s'est bâti une solide réputation, tant au Québec qu'à l'étranger. C'est pour souligner la fin d'une longue session universitaire que nous sommes allés, en groupe, vivre notre baptême du Pied de Cochon.BOUFFEComme d'autres restos de sa trempe, il est difficile d'attribuer un type de cuisine particulier au PDC, mais sachez simplement que le tout tourne autour d'ingrédients locaux...et du cochon.En pleine saison des sucres, un daiquiri à l'érable (11$) était sur le menu ce soir-là; pour ma part, j'ai essayé leur bière maison (5.50$). Légère déception en débutant la soirée; la saveur de l'érable était quasi inexistante dans les daiquiris et la bière était un peu faible à mon goût (une 4% je suppose).Un autre item qui ne figurait pas au menu régulier, la salade de canard (~14$), composée de pommes de terre, d'un œuf et de tous les morceaux imaginables d'un canard.Malgré la modeste portion, la fameuse Poutine au Foie gras (23$) est facilement partageable à quatre Gourmands, tellement c'est riche (gravy au foie gras quand même).Le délicieux melting pot du Pied de Cochon (20.50$), dans lequel on retrouve, entre autres, du boudin et des saucisses.Mon coup de cœur a été la Côte de cochon heureux (25$). Couvert d'oignons et de champignons, la viande est cuite à la perfection et tout simplement délicieuse.Nous commencions tranquillement à être rassasié, mais il y avait encore deux plats en route. Pour prendre une brève pause de cochon, on a également choisi le plat de Poisson du jour de la Nouvelle-Écosse (~36$), servi avec une sauce bien crémeuse, des têtes de violon et des champignons. Comme quoi, il n'y a pas que le porc qui est maitrisé dans la cuisine du PDC.Finalement, on a conclu le festin avec rien de moins que le Pied de Cochon (22$). Caché sous une épaisse peau, on retrouve une chair très savoureuse et tendre. La purée de pomme de terre qui l'accompagne est tout aussi succulente.Malheuresement, on n'avait plus de place pour un dessert, mais ce n'est que partie remise.SERVICE/AMBIANCEÀ l'image de la bouffe qui était servie, le service était impecable. Notre serveur connaissait tous les plats en détail et prenait le temps de nous les expliquer. Le souper s'est étalé sur un bon trois heures, mais en aucun temps on s'est senti pressé, malgré la ligne qui commençait à se former à la porte. Une ambiance assez animée reigne dans le resto et la cuisine semi-ouverte crée un certain charme.Ce qui me plaît aussi du PDC, c'est les prix assez raisonnables des plats principaux. En effet, on a partagé six plats, avec consommations, pour un grand total de ~55$ par personne, ce qui est pas mal moins cher que dans d'autres restos du genre.Notre prochaine visite est cédulée pour le mois prochain et j'en salive déjà !COOL- La bouffe, tout simplement.- Pour ceux qui ne le savent pas, il y a aussi la Cabane à sucre du Pied de Cochon, maintenant ouvert pour la saison des pommes, à l'automne.BOF- Petit bémol sur les drinksReservations were recommendation so I emailed the restaurant. .  . "Good morning, I would like to make dinner reservations for one for Oct 5 if possible.  I will be traveling to Montreal by myself and would love to dine at a place famed for foie gras.  Please let me know what times are available, I can be very flexible but I prefer 8 pm."Response. . ."Hello, Thank you for your reservation request. For how many people would you like to reserve on October 5th ?"Ummmm please do not let this be an indication of how my solo trip is going to be!!!  Is it so strange for a lady to be traveling by herself just because??!?!  I responded, reiterating that I will be traveling by myself and would only need a reservation for one, just me, nobody but me and my independent woman self.I was granted my reservation and marched in a few weeks later.  The reception from the hostess, waiter and everybody at the restaurant was the very definition of welcoming and helpful.  I was seated at the bar next to a couple other single diners with a full view of the kitchen.  The kitchen commotion was a refreshing change from staring at my phone during a meal (the thing was useless anyway since I was out of the country).After a nice discussion with the waiter over my options, we decided that I would enjoy the squid ink pasta with sea urchin (you had me at sea urchin) and the foie gras tout nu.  Both dishes were very rich with generous portions and were absolutely heaven.  I would have licked the plates to pay my compliments to the chef if I was a little bit less inhibited!!  The two appetizers were a bit much for my solo self as I attacked a plate of poutine earlier for lunch.  I was uncomfortably full but gustatorily satisfied.  Note to self - Save precious stomach space next time!!  You are no long a young spring chicken who can finish a whole large pizza in one setting!!  Those days are over!!For my next visit I am eyeing the foie gras cromesquis and the "duck in a can" as recommended by so many reviewers. . . Unless my waiter persuades me to another dish ;-)If there's one place to recommend in Montreal, it will have to be Au Pied de Cochon. Make sure to call weeks ahead for dinner reservations to secure a table. My friend and I winged it and walked-in hoping something was open and sure enough, they had two seats at the bar. We were stoked as we saw the view in front of us. We had the best seats in the house! It's an open kitchen with the entire crew sans Chef Martin Picard, working within an arm's reach. We got to see all the action, interacted with the chefs, and witnessed all the dishes before they got served to all the tables. How awesome is that?We were off to a slow start with our server being so busy with other tables but he got us started with our beers and gave us enough time to figure out what to get. It was a struggle as everything on the menu sounded so decadent. Being from California, the banning of foie gras has made me craving for it. This place has foie in almost all their dishes. Imagine my excitement! Here's what we ended up getting which my dear friend and I all shared:FOIE GRAS CROMESQUIS ($3.50) or croquettes if you will. It's filled with foie gras jus oozing out as you bite into the crisp, deep-fried breading. It was really just a bite to tease us for what's next to come. Then came the GUINEA HEN LIVER MOUSSE ($8). A jar filled to the brim with the mousse accompanied by some orange marmalade and sauerkraut on the side to complement each other. This proved too enticing for me to resist wiping out completely. Ask for extra toast if you run out or use the table bread which by the way, was also hard not to indulge in. Warm, crusty, and fresh from the oven.A special of the evening was their MOULES FRITES ($10). This was not on the menu but we saw lots of these coming out of the kitchen and we just had to order it. For an appetizer, the serving was hefty. The sauce, wow, buttery with bacon bits and a hint of white wine. It was addicting and to dip the bread in it was inevitable until all the white creamy liquid was no more. We had quite a pause until our main course came. We welcomed it and watched the live show in front of us, oohhh'ing and ahhhh'ing as we saw beautiful plates of pig heads, pied de cochons, foie poutines, meatloafs, and ducks in a can pass right in our faces. Finally, the star of the show, STUFFED PIED DE COCHON WITH FOIE GRAS ($45) was laid in front of us. It was ginormous! We were planning on getting an order each initially but bless Chef Audrey's heart for letting us know this was a meal a family can consume. The pig's feet was nicely breaded and laid atop a bed of super creamy mashed potatoes, covered with a stew of mushrooms and onions, then topped with perfectly seared foie gras. Rich, decadent, and seasoned without any apprehension, Chef Martin depicts his true colors on this one amazing plate. Needless to say, the other half had to be packed and eaten the next day. We left completely satiated by the "in your face" flavors on every plate and thankful for the crew that was fun and pleasant. Capping off our Montreal trip at Au Pied de Cochon could not have been any better. Merci beaucoup!For my boyfriend and my final dinner in Montreal, we made reservations at Au Pied de Cochon.We were greeted by a friendly waiter and he went through the specials with us (there were a lot of specials). He described the cold lobster soup ($12) so well, I decided to go with it. We also got oysters (6 for $18) because I love raw oysters. Lastly, we had to get au pied de cohon au foie gras ($45). The waiter was nice enough to tell us that hte au pied de cochon will be enough for the two us and that we shouldn't order any other mains. They also offered us freshly baked bread as we waited for our appetizers and main meal.When we got the cold lobster soup, we were surprised because we didn't hear the waiter mentioning that it was cold. It was quite salty and I didn't catch any lobster flavour in the soup at all.When the oysters came, I was super excited until I saw the size of it. It was quite small considering it was $3 a piece. I could get the same size oyster for cheaper ($1 a piece) at Biff's Bistro in Toronto during their happy hour. Nonetheless, the oysters were delicious and the sauce that it came with went wonderfully together.Lastly was our main meal which took 30 minutes of wait time after finishing our appetizers. The meat fell off the pig's foot. The sauce over the mushrooms was so good. The best part was the mashed potato with cheese melted into it. This restaurant really lived up to its hype on this dish.However, our night sadly went downhill because the waiter was nowhere to be seen. We wanted to see the dessert menu to possibly order more food. However, every time we see him, he'll finish talking to another customer and then walk the opposite direction from where we were sitting. Finally, we decided to get the bill. We finally flagged him down and he didn't get back to us at all. From the end of our main meal to trying to get the dessert menu to us trying to get the bill took over 30 minutes. In the end, it was another person (looks like the manger) who got us the bill.I still give this place four stars. Although the waiter completely failed at serving our table, the food was awesome and the price point wasn't too bad.After much hype, I made it here with a few colleagues on a Wednesday evening. The place was absolutely hopping and hard to get into, but we made a reservation a few weeks in advance.Once inside we sat at the bar, which is by far the best seat in the house. It comes with a direct view of the kitchen and all the goodness the chefs are whipping up. We started out with the ham special for appetizer, which was delicious. It came with a baguette and butter which made it perfect. We then had some poutine, which was also quite good. It was definitely better quality than most poutine dishes. For the main course, I went aggressive and got a mixed bowl consisting of blood sausage, pork sausage, mushrooms and onions sitting on top of mashed potatoes. The dish was very good, but not the amazing experience I was hoping for. Spices could have been a little better, but make no mistake it was a very good dish.With its popular reputation, upbeat atmosphere and good food, this is definitely a place worth visiting when in town. They also have a really good bar with interesting drinks. Great overall experience.Do you love ducks? Or better yet, do you hate ducks? To the point where you'll eat ducks in every form for 3 different dishes? If so, Au Pied de Cochon is just what the doctor ordered.Sure, the name translates to the pig's feet, but the duck is where it's at.Foie gras poutine is about as rich and delicious as it sounds.The duck in a can (which COMES WITH FOIE GRAS) is also a must. Just watching the waiter take a can opener to it and drop it onto a plate is a thing of beauty. The entire can is boiled and then brought out. All the spices are infused and all the fattiness is preserved without getting boiled off. Super unique. Just don't overdo it. One can is probably enough for 3-4 people unless you REALLY want to feel unhealthy.We also got a side of duck fat fries, because WHY THE HELL NOT?There were 8 of us, so we did a few other entrees as well. One was the PDC's cut, which the waiter told us was a boneless pork chop (there was a bone). It looked dry, but it was actually incredibly moist. It was a gigantic hunk of meat too.We also did one of the specials - the Ahi tuna steak for two. Let me tell you, it was NOT for two. Maybe if you fasted and that was the only thing you ate that day. But it was also good. Perfectly rare, with a ton of veggies and cheese on the side. It was probably our least favorite of the dishes, but even still, it was very well done.We were seated all the way in the back by the wine cellar, so it was a bit of a tight squeeze (especially with another large group next to us), but there wasn't much else to complain about. They also have one hell of a wine list.Our waiter was super cool and gave us shots to round out the night.Probably one of the best meals I've ever had. Also, why I came back to the States with none of pants fitting anymore.I went with a southern French person to this restaurant but he did not completely agree with my assessment. Just a caveat. :-)We really wanted to try a Montreal special, as this place is very well known. This place has the famous foie gras poutine and Duck in a Can. We decided to all share to try a few more dishes. The baguette is good!The ambience is nice. We went right when it opened and there was a small line waiting. You cannot get seated if you have not made a reservation. Plan ahead. 1. Garden salad: not on the menu, but we figured we were having so many animal parts this was probably a good idea. $15 for generic salad. The salad was fresh but basic. 2. Mushroom risotto: this dish is very expensive for what it is, but you get a show. They come to your table with a large cheese bowl and add the risotto, mushroom, and even Canadian bacon. This dish had potential but was much too salty. It was hard to finish. 3. Terragon Bison tongue: this is tongue well done. The texture is very soft, which is impressive given the quality of most tongues. The sauces and everything just work well together. However, it's game-y so just be warned. 4. Foie gras poutine: loved it. The fries were good. The gravy was also good. The foie gras was in large blocks and was nice and fatty. I think if you come here, you should get this dish! 5. Duck in a Can: I loved watching them pour half a duck out of a can. Life experience. It even looked nice coming out. The duck came out as a thick filet attached to a flap of lard and also fatty liver (foie gras). I enjoyed this dish very much. It was over puréed cauliflower. The issue I had was that the duck meat was very thick. I had to eat it with slices of the lard to complement the taste. Overall a good dish. 6. Dessert: we got the maple cake and the lemon pie. Both were pretty good. Get the maple cake for novelty sake! Very sweet but good flavors. It was a pricy meal, but for a specialty restaurant it made sense.
Grand Lux Cafe=Please avoid ordering an omelette here. It looks like a styrofoam frisbee that's been folded in half (stuffed with your favorite diced meats and/or veggies). It tastes like styrofoam too because I don't think they use real eggs (eggs in a carton, fo sho). And the omelettes are steamed...yuck. I have visual evidence posted here for those who doubt me. Other than that, they have decently priced food. The portions are big and you don't leave here still feeling hungry. I went here twice for lunch and I didn't have to wait in line at all. The service is polite, prompt, and accomodating. Overall, this restaurant is a good place to go to eat for convenience (if you're staying at The Palazzo) and decent food.Cheesecake Factory like menu, but much better quality! Apparently it's like Banana Republic to Old Navy but for restaurants. I know it's a chain restaurant so sue me for giving them a 5 star review! There were 7 of us here for dinner so you know the service charge was in effect! Those lucky servers! LOL! I usually stick to a handful of menu items, but you can't really go wrong with anything on the menu. I usually order the crispy caramel chicken, Indochine chicken and shrimp, fish n chips, jambalaya or any of their salads. Their prices are really reasonable too!I happened to order the Southwestern chicken salad which included chicken, lettuce, avocado, black bean, corn, crispy tortilla strips, tomatoes, a few other goodies along with a lime vinaigrette. The salad was super fresh and was really tasty! I always ate here before and will keep doing so as long as the quality of service and food are at this high of a level! I hope that they don't drop in quality like the Cheesecake Factory has in the last few years.Have any of you ever had the feeling where you just can't stand another buffet in Vegas?  Or just simply sick and tired of looking at all the food stations with endless possibilities for a potential food coma? (Well I never had that problem but people in my party certainly had that predicament)  So I guess I will just have to follow suit and take in a regular dining facility instead of the glamorous world of buffet heaven.I've been to a Grand Lux before so it wasn't anything new to me.   It is the sister restaurant of Cheesecake Factory's therefore I have no complaints here at all.  Just like any Cheesecake's you've been to it's got lavish decor, dim lighting, and of course, endless options on their menu.It's a typical California (cheesecake factory) fare where you can pretty much get anything and everything.. so here are the dishes that our party have ordered!Polynesian Salad!  Citrusy flavored dressing with a hint of sweetness all rolled into one drizzled upon a pyramid like salad concoction.  The veggie temple was build with a foundation of mixed greens and tiered off by giant wonton crisps!  It's pretty much the sister version of the Luau Salad at the Cheesecake factory... one of the most delicious salads for a nice sit down restaurant!Grand Cobb Salad:  It's grand but actually not as large portioned as the Polynesian salad.  It's got all your typical culprits in a cobb (avocado, bacon, turkey, egg whites, etc..) All dressed in bleu cheese!  (I thought it was ranch..  Yuck!  I hate Blue Cheese!!!  However, when I actually gave it a try, the dressing as actually tasty and bearable!  (I simply cannot handle bleu cheese) So that's actually tasty as well!Madeira Chicken:  Didn't get to try this out but according to our friends, it was tasty!  (I'm not a big chicken breast dish kind of guy so I never order these things)  I'll just take their word for it!Spicy Flat Bread Chicken Sandwich:  Same as above as I didn't get to try the sammy, but it was gone from my buddy's plate so that's a good sign!  Gotta try that next time!Slow Roasted Short Ribs of Beef:  Great BBQ flavor!  It's your typical BBQ flavor dish but definitely tasty!  (With BBQ you really cannot go wrong unless you overcook it which will make it super dry and gross)  But it was nicely flavored, juicy, and delicious overall!  (huge portion too! as it was served with veggies and mash Potato!)Fried Calamari:  Highlight alert!  This is one of the best Calamari that I've ever had in many different places!  They fried their calamari along with veggies and rock shrimp to create the most heavenly dish (one of my all time favorites!) served with ranch and spicy aioli dressing!  I'm telling you, if you were to pick one dish to get at Grand Lux, this one is highly highly recommended!  Oh... did I mention the portion for this is huge?  Well you bet it is!  Totally worth every penny!Lastly, service was awesome as it comes to expected being affiliated with cheesecake Factory.  They brought out wrong salad dressing for me and when I asked for it, 2 different wait staff came out with the dressing!  (Now I got 3!)  Great attention to customer's needs is definitely a plus!So there you have it, Grand Lux Cafe, opens 24 hrs, in Venetian or Palazzo, and will serve your morning, noon, dinner, or late night dining needs in case you are totally turned off by the buffets of  Vegas!  A terrific alternative yet decently priced!Almost 3 am on a saturday (technically sunday morning) AND THEY'RE STILL OPEN, HORRAY.. yeah i know I'm lame for coming back from the club so early!.. but after 3 am this palazzo location wont let you in SO you'll have to try the venetian location which opens laterCOMPLIMENTARY sour dough bread as you sit and wait... though its nothing spectacularFOOD CAME OUT FAST.. although time may have been flying by faster in my somewhat intoxicated mind..---short rib grilled cheese was pretty TASTY---ahi tuna burger was yummy too (but i'd definitely get the short rib sammie over this one!) the waiter was really nice & accommodating! he never rushed us even though we got in just before closing!Checked this 24/7 place out after arriving in Vegas late Friday night. Came in at about 3:30AM and was surrounded by lots of exhausted barefoot clubbers with heels in tow. From what I remember, we were seated promptly and greeted by a friendly waitress. I wanted a Long Island Iced Tea, but was instructed that "Texas Tea" was an ample substitute, and that it had "spurs". Intrigued by the spurs, and wondering if they would kick my night in the right direction, I decided to order one.  I was a little disappointed, as It tasted like sweetened Nestea with a splash of vodka and lemon.  I sent it back, and ordered a more appropriate vodka martini with 3 giant olives.  Excellent.  I also ordered the seared tuna which was excellent.  I don't really recall how much everything was, but I do remember the sun was up when we left later that "night".One of my faaaaaaaavs!!Their hamburger melt is to fackin' die for..oh mah gahd. Delicious crunchy fries, and good ranch. I'm a ranch fiend..and always love me a good tasting ranch. It's even delicious when it's cold. Haha.Shopping can be so exhausting at the Palazzo. I know....life is tough.There are a plethora of places to sit down and eat. Actually it is quite overwhelming to pick a place. Something persuaded me to enter the Grand Luxe Cafe.  I was not too thrilled at first because I've been to one at Beverly Center (back home in LA). It was late morning and I had left my friends at the hotel to venture off on my own. With that said I didn't need to wait in line like the rest of the folks, I got seated right away at the counter in the bar area. My server's name was Chris (he remembered me when I visited again the second time a month later). We had a few great conversations and I even chatted with the folks who sat next to me. I love breakfast so I opted for just plain old eggs and toast. Then I wanted orange juice.....just a little kicked up.....got myself a Clementine Crush (Clementine Orange Vodka and Cointreau Shaken with Fresh Orange, Lime, Passion Fruit and Pineapple Juice). Let me tell you, that drink was the perfect way to start my morning at Vegas. It was so freakin' good even my neighbor got the same order. Maybe it's the way Chris makes it....who knows.....but this shit is good. I was a little tipsy so had to stay a little bit longer than I expected, lol.The service is outstanding. The atmosphere is relaxing. And the Clementine Crush is to die for. And yes I came back here again for breakfast a few months later.I hate writing 3 star reviews, they are the most boring.  I am usually too lazy to write them to be honest.  Nothing was that great, nothing was that bad, just a forgettable meal.  The Grand Lux Cafe at the Palazzo was just that for me.  Came here for breakfast because we wanted to stay close to the hotel.  After looking at a very uninspired breakfast buffet, we ordered off the menu.I ordered "The Best Eggs Benedict".  Really, that's what it's called on the menu.  I would like them to change the name to  "Not the Worst Eggs Benedict".  Eggs were poached nicely, but the ham wasn't anything special.  A big slab of Louis Rich quality ham.  The english muffin was a pretty large compared to the poached egg.  It wasn't very toasted and thus got soggy underneath a pile of hollandaise sauce.  Way too much sauce going on here.  Fortunately it came with a side of hash browns to soak up all the sauce.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/grand-lux-cafe-las-vegas-5?start=300#4xIDFoFkv-erhPe8JFuqfwThe wife had the DeLux Breakfast Sandwich, which came with scrambled eggs, ham, bacon, grilled tomato, and havarti cheese.  I didn't try any of it, but she just kind of shrugged her shoulders when I asked how it was. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/grand-lux-cafe-las-vegas-5?start=300#Jst4brxUtnAHaajwiebEDQMy brother also wasn't impressed with his Huevos Rancheros.  Fried eggs on top of corn tortillas, black beans, sautéed peppers and onions, with cheddar cheese topped with "spicy" ranchero sauce.  His biggest problem was that the ranchero sauce had no spice at all, in fact the whole dish was quite flavorless even though it looked nice.  He salvaged his breakfast with the help of tabasco sauce.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/grand-lux-cafe-las-vegas-5?start=300#Rmtzr49KIb2JE_Mev2HcGgThe only hit were the breakfast beignets.  These were excellent.  This might have been the first time having a beignet, where I haven't thought, if only I were at the Cafe du Monde in New Orleans.  So often places try to do a knock off of those, but these seemed to be their own thing.  They were piping hot right out of the fryer with just a small amount of powdered sugar on them.  I'm normally a purest and want my beignets with lots of sugar and that's it, but these were served with 4 dipping sauces.  Lots of sugar would have gotten in the way here for dipping. My favorite sauce was sweet milk based, like a more liquid bavarian cream.  The raspberry sauce was also excellent.  Mixing the two sauces even better.  There was also a chocolate sauce and a cinnamon sugar based sauce.  There were at least 8 or 9 beignets in the basket, perfect for sharing.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/grand-lux-cafe-las-vegas-5?start=300#pd2HMS9A30TXlwNFPRAXxwIf it's breakfast time, I would come back for beignets for sure and some coffee, but that's about it.  Not sure about lunch or dinner, you'll have to read other people's reviews on that.I heart the Grand Lux whether it's here at the Polazzo or Venetian - the food is yummy and satisfying. The restaurant opens early so I arrived for breakfast on a Friday.  Parking is convenient if you park by the casino elevator and is a near walk to the restaurant. I was seated asap and was greeted by my friendly waitress who brought me hot coffee. The bfast menu is large but I was craving a Mexican entree and went with the huevos rancheros - two eggs over medium, black beans, bell peppers and purple onions over crisp corn tortillas & topped with a zesty green salsa. The entree hit the spot and cured my Mexican food caving.Overall another nice experience at the Grand Lux.Every time I come to the Grand Lux Cafe, I always order the same thing: the Grand Lux Burger Melt.  It's full of grease, cheese, meat, and I LOVE IT.  The burger melt is extremely cheesy with cheese not only inside the burger, but also melted onto the bread.  There's usually a wait during lunchtime and dinnertime, but we try to stagger our meals when in Vegas to avoid the crowds.We arrived at around 3:00PM on a Thursday, and although we were seated immediately, it took a while to receive our food.  The food is worth the wait.  The fries were crispy, the burger was delicious, and the side of ranch had a little spicy kick to it.  Their strawberry lemonade is the bees knees (especially in the 105 degree, hot, dry, Vegas weather).Our waitress was attentive, and refilled our drinks before they were empty.  I've always been familiar with the Grand Lux Cafe in the Venetian, however the Palazzo's cafe was equally as good in both service and quality of food.  Will definitely visit again!4 1/2 stars. I came in for breakfast since I know how consistent this place is. Park in the underground parking next to the casino elevator for easy access to this Grand Lux.I arrived later then normal for bfast and there was a line 8 deep during the week. I passed on the buffet and selected the ham and eggs. The ham steak was yummy and contained just the right amount of fat on the outside of the steak to give it an awesome flavor. The potatoes, scrambled eggs and English muffin were all excellent also.My waitress was friendly and attentive and must say - I've never had a negative experience at the Grand Lux Cafe.Found this place in the Palazzo when we were looking for a place close by Wynn that wasn't too expensive and yet not food court food.Originally ordered the Maui Rib Eye ($28), but it came out well-done instead of medium rare... Non-edible.  Since they were going to make a new one, I opted for the regular Rib Eye Steak. The Maui Rib Eye was too sweet for me, and took away all the meat flavors. The flavor of the regular Rib Eye was just perfect. I opted for a side of Asparagus instead of a baked potato.Great service! The waitress took one look at my well-done steak and offered to bring me one that was prepared right.Medicore for breakfast. The buffet was pretty pathetic looking, especially considering this is Vegas, land of the endless buffets with all you can eat lobster and pancakes (yes together and yes it's weird). I've seen better breakfast buffets in LA. We decided to just order. My fiance ordered an omelette and I ordered cereal. It took forever to get our food and when it arrived it wasn't anything special. Almost everything on the breakfast menu seemed heavy. The only reason we ate here was because we had the breakfast credit from American Express, but honestly, next time I'd rather pay for breakfast and go somewhere decent.My gf and I returned to Las Vegas Cafe for our second trip. We had eaten here once before and enjoyed the meal. This trip we ate here 3 times because we found that the restaurant really lives up to its guidelines of fresh ingredients, extensive menu, and good prices.The restaurant is very large, seats up to 728 people, but is divided into 3 areas: street cafe, bar area and main dining room, and the main dining room has a high ceiling, but is well designed so not truly "noisy". They do designate non-smoking areas, which seems to help. It is owned and run by the Cheesecake Factory, but is elegant in its design. Although I have not been to the Cheesecake Factory, it is my understanding that the menu is rather different than that of the Factory.It is located on the same floor as the casino in the Venetian and is open 24/7. There is a breakfast menu, lunch dinner menu, and late night menu, the latter which, for obvious reasons, is smaller than the main menu, but still quite good.The portions are substantial, so we were able to order one salad and one entree and split them and feel adequately fed. The ingredients were extremely fresh and flavors were understated.I consider this restaurant a true gem of a find in Las Vegas.So I remember going to this place a long time ago and thought it was only okay, but my friend convinced me that it was yummy and that I should return.This location had no wait on a sunday afternoon and we were seated right away in the corner of the restaurant. Although we were tucked away in the back corner, the server did not forget about us and attended to us immediately. WARNING: portions are big! The three of us ordered three appetizers and three entrees... lets just say we were extremely full and food coma-ing for awhile.. Appetizers:Asian Nachos- Who even thinks of this stuff! crispy wonton chips with chicken, wasabi cream, cheese, and sweet hot peanut sauce with fried rice in the middle. I don't know if these were made for asians or something but damn were these good! The slight hint of wasabi cream really added to the nachos, and adding the fried rice on top of the chip was super asian and delicious.Brie Wonton with creamy brie cheese, fresh pineapple, and caramelized onion marmalade- this was okay, i expected better. I didn't taste the pineapple in the wonton, and they left the rind on the brie so the taste was kind of bitter. Sauce was good.Crispy Pepperoni Mini Pizza- they added parmesan slices on top which really added to the pizza in terms of texture and and flavor. Other than that, regular pepperoni pizza.Entrees:Lunch special salad and pasta carbonara- the pasta was bomb. Yeah you can make pasta at home but the bacon bits, chicken and cheese was super flavorful and tasty. The noodles were also cooked well. Housemade Pierogies- Pierogies are basically potato dumplings which they made by hand, and they added roasted short rib with mushrooms and onions. Yum. Yeah pierogies are plain and heavy and basic, but it's good comfort food and perfect after a long night. Avocado Chipotle Cheeseburger- this thing was giant. I asked for medium rare and mushrooms instead of peppers, and it was a giant stacked burger. The cheese was melted all over the place (perfectly) and the meat was cooked the way I wanted it. The avocados were chopped (I expected it to be in slices) and it kept falling all over the place. Really messy dish, but good burger and good fries. Overall this restaurant is perfect as a heavy lunch or dinner. Definitely exceeded my expectations from what I had last time (which I don't really remember). Total came out to be $71, which is pretty fair as we did order a lot of food.. Would definitely come if staying at Palazzo or Venetian after a long night.You can NEVER go wrong with Grand Lux Cafe. Morning, Afternoon and Night I could have this place. I love the food! The portions are hugeee and just delicious! We ordered red velvet pancakes one morning omg I couldn't even eat the whole thing, they were beyond amazing especially with the cream cheese frosting, drooool!  The omelette was good however we have had better and the hashbrowns were average, you even get toast and a bagel.  Another day we ordered the chicken jambalaya with noodles, damn they were good a bit on the salty side but delicious.  This is an absolute must for me every time I'm in Vegas.***Grand Lux Cafe is conveniently located on the casino floor at The Venetian/Palazzo; their brunch menu is priced similarly to Las Vegas 24-hour cafes; I did a build-your-own omelette, which consisted of bacon, cheddar cheese, onion, and assorted peppers (you have the option to add up to 4 ingredients); the omelette was good (nicely cooked and all of the ingredients worked well together); the omelette came with crispy shredded hash browns and good and hearty wheat toast (a toasted English muffin is available as an alternative to the toast); the brunch was decent and filling; you can get a more upscale and more delicious brunch at Bouchon (also located at this hotel), but that restaurant is harder to get to, not as filling and more expensive***Like almost all of the major resort hotels on The Strip, The Venetian and Palazzo offer complimentary self and valet parking.When in Vegas, I always make a trip to Grand Lux and only eat one thing of theirs: the Zen Noodles. Yes it's totally a rip off ($15) spin of "pho" and also pretty white washed version of pho. But I like it! The broth is lemongrass flavored (not beef) and they use chicken. You add bean sprouts and spinach and ask for sriracha and you just made yourself a healthy pho! The broth is sour so don't expect a beef flavored. And you don't really need sriracha but I love it spicy. It's a really good spin on pho. My GFs and I always get this late at night! Since grand Lux is open 24 hours, we eat here after clubbing. You don't know how many times zen noodles saved me from a nasty hangover!
Mandarin Chef=After a second visit I am revising down to 2.25 stars.  They do chicken dishes pretty well but we have been disappointed in other things.  And their spicy is not very spicy.  I added hot oil to my spicy garlic shrimp.  I actually dipped my shrimp into the side of hot oil I requested.  That got 'er done.I almost requested chopsticks so that I could repeatedly jam them in my ears and stop hearing the brutal Muzak renditions of such songs as "Yesterday" and "I Started a Joke".  My daughter even piped up with, "Dad, this music is really, really bad.  What is it?"
Jumbo Buffet=As an Old Laveener, (even though i'm only 24 - I'm still old!) it's crazy to see fields develop into something different. For the longest there used to be field worker selling their surplus crops and now - there is a strip mall where a field used to be... and on the North East corner of said field is new and huge Jumbo Buffet.I first went to Jumbo Buffet during their grand opening. We entered into their brand spanking new place and saw a very clean and kinda tacky dining room. I gotta admit - I think it's kinda cute... but just kinda. But what I do like is their GIGANTIC plasma hung high in their dining room. It's on, but it's muted and you don't notice it unless you're looking for it, despite it's size. They have uniformed and friendly enough staff. But many things get lost in translation.I thought they had decent food - nothing great, but decent. They have a HUGE variet of food that attempts to be better than the run of the mill chinese buffet however - because there's so many dishes the cooks really can't concentrate on the dishes they do put out. So subpar all around. It was crazy busy which is to be expected however - we were frustrated with our server who had trouble understanding us and getting our drinks refilled was an uphill battle. One funny thing is that the buffet features a very well maintained Mongolian BBQ and someone asked for a hot dog! yes, a hot dog!! What was even MORE odd was that they had it!! lol! Pretty soon everyone was devouring hot dogs! Recently, I ventured back to Jumbo Buffet. I was disappointed to see that they raised their prices to $11 a person. and their American food was slipping. No longer were their roasted potatos and onions were these light crispy chunks of goodness - now they were oily and oniony hunks of mashiness - blech. The sushi is just as mediorcure as it was the first time I went. However, their salmon maki was decent. Their soups - I wouldn't trust their soups 'nuff said. The sweet & sour chicken was the biggest disappointment - the first time I went it was fresh and yummy, this last time - it was dense and hard! and it hurt my teeth to bite into it! ouch! What did stay good were their many seafood selections, the octupus still scared the crap out of lil kids, their fried shrimp was still good as were their crispy egg rolls. The Mongolian BBQ is still well maintained and thankfully everything was at a nice cold temperature! Their orange chicken was yummy! and or COURSE, the hot dogs still stole the show!! I would like to suggest to the owners of Jumbo Buffet that they close the smaller dining room that is obviously a different "store" within the strip mall and rennovate it into a hotdog place... and if they were to bring back the old Potato & Onions dish, in place of fries - that would kick ASS!!Came by for dinner buffet last Friday- paid $11 plus tax.  Beware, if you order anything else but water to drink, you will be charged at least $1.50 for it!  I arrived sometime around 4p, so I wasn't sure I'd be charged for lunch or dinner.  I'd already visited the buffet line twice when I noticed there weren't any crabs to be found; I was told that they were still cooking.  I'm guessing that the crabs were placed in the buffet line around 4:45p.LOVED the frog legs!  These will be one of the first I will sweep up on my next visit!  I also enjoyed the baked mussels, salmon, roasted cinnamon sweet potatoes, Chinese-bbq'ed pork (from the grill), and five-spiced crab.  I also spotted crab legs, but thought I'd save those for my next visit.  I also adored the steamed buns (the differing textures of the buns were perfect!) with red mung bean inside, and especially the lilyleaf-wrapped sticky rice and red beans (for my sweet-tooth)!!  There weren't many when I saw them (there were only two, actually), and despite my inquiring for more, none were brought out.Liked the omelet-topped sushi.  Coudn't try the others as they contained allergens.  Tried the sashimi, even though they still looked and felt frozen.  I ended up trashing these.  I took a few pieces of octopus to the table and liked the two bites I had before sitting down.  However, after having a few bites of the other food samples, I went back to the octopus pcs. and it felt like I was chewing on leather, and the taste wasn't that far-off from leather, either.  Even though I had my fill of sweets with the red mungbean buns and sticky rice, I had to try the soft-serve ice cream.  JB needs to enlarge their toppings area- I ran out of oreo cookie bits!  I didn't try it, but I spotted a great-looking strawberry-rhubarb pie...Now in the culinary wasteland that is Laveen, we decided to give the Jumbo Buffet a try. Never again. Very few food items were up to temperature, which explains my digestive distress later on. The sushi was sketchy looking and tasted old. The meat was either dried out or fatty. The steak on the Mongolian BBQ looked as if it had been there a week. The ice milk was hard and the other desserts were all pre-packaged and virtually flavorless. This buffet is an epic fail in my opinion.
Crave Cafe & Lounge=I came here with my Sunday date guy, and I had a good time.  It was late, and we wanted something simple.  We ended up coming here because it was open, and neither of us had been here before.I liked the fact that Sunday, from 4-10 is half off everything!  The entire menu!!!  We had a great meal there, and it cost us $14.50.  Loved it!
Popeyes Chicken & Biscuits=I think perhaps fast food chicken places hire the most stupid of all employees available to the fast food industry.We have stopped here a few times to pick up food and eat it at home. Not once have we gotten what we ordered. Ok I am sure now you are thinking I must be the most stupid of customer for not checking before I leave. Well yeah I agree with you. But this last time we ordered 12 pieces, I did look in the bag to see that all that we ordered was there. I did not take the chicken out to count it, we got eight pieces. Gus called to complain and all they said was, what am I supposed to do about it? So I will answer that question now, Nothing do nothing and I will wise up and just bypass your store from now on.
MezzaNotte Brick Oven Pizza=I have driven by MezzaNotte many times, brick oven pizza just doesn't make me wanna stop, but someone said that MN was really good, so I filed it in my little restaurant Rolodex mind. Today driving aimlessly thinking where should I stop for lunch, decided to give it a whirl.Sat at the bar, looked at the $8.95 express lunch  menu, get this. Choice of soup or two salads, slice of pepperoni or cheese pizza and then four or five main courses and TEA! nine bucks. Can I get a hell yeah?Service was ok, my waiter, well, um, let's just say, "he's just not that into me." It was pretty funny, he was pleasant enough, but very indifferent.  Which, hey, I don't care, as long as I have everything I need I'm fine. I ordered the arugula salad, cheese pizza and chicken marsala. The salad and the cheese pizza were hitting the spot and I hadn't even had the chicken yet. The chicken marsala didn't have any mushrooms or a starch. It was chicken on a plate. It was good, not very marsalally, but good.I enjoyed my lunch today and I thought it was a great value. One of the best  greetings is the olive oil white beans with crusty bread. That alone is worth the trip.Can't wait to go back and see my BFF at the bar.
Taqueria Guadalajara=Back and better than ever! How do you take an already solid place and make it more remarkable?A new sleek space. New furniture! New paint!Stunning... I'm talking stunning stainless steel!A really cool storefront that's a bajillion times better than the old. But what hasn't changed? Still (in my opinion) the most authentic Mexican joint we have in Madison. It's meat on a corn tortilla. With some pico and cilantro. That's what I ate for 7 years, I'm thrilled to keep the tradition alive, and I haven't found anything better in the 608. (People try though... why does everyone want to convince me to keep looking?)TG has risen from the ashes and spread it's wings. New front room, bigger kitchen but same good stuff. Try a bunch of tacos ($2) and a couple of sopes (a $3 pile of awesome) if you like but the steak Platillo Guadalajara ($10) is my favorite. Wash it down with a couple of Negra Modelos and walk away a fan muy contento.5 stars for the chimichanga alone. HUGE portions (woohoo leftovers for lunch tomorrow) It's your basic Mexican restaurant décor. The food is served fast and the margaritas are to die for. Only regret I didn't order fried ice creamGod bless this restaurant. I thought good Mexican food didn't exist in Madison...then I realised I was talking to people who thought a to-remain-nameless local tex mex chain was "pretty great" "Mexican" "food." and then I found Taqueria Guadalajara, and my life hasn't been the same since. They have super friendly and fast service, insanely good prices, cute decor, and amaaaaazing food. They are super busy on weekends so prepare for a wait but it will be worth it! Try the pozole, available only on weekends. It's incredibly soothing and satisfying, the perfect cold weather and/or hangover cure. They also have the best horchata in town. Taqueria Guadalajara forever!!!!
Restaurant Le Pegase=Le Pegase is perfect for a romantic date, or even a family gathering. This French restaurant sits on a quiet Mont Royal street, with little to call attention to itself save for the pegasus on its sign.Everything we tasted satisfied, from the duck confit salad - drizzled with a lovely balsamic vinaigrette - to the duck with orange zest (C$40 total), the tender meat[1] done in a homey preparation. Pacing was ideal[2]: in-between courses we enjoyed the bottles of vino we toted in."Merci bien" to the friendly, accommodating service.[1] What can I say? I love duck.[2] Seriously, when can I come here again?
Via Brasil Steakhouse=I was recently having a conversation with some people about this place. For some reason, we were also talking about Groupons. I said that if a Groupon ever came up for Via Brasil, I'm jumping on it. Lo and behold, a Groupon appears days later. It was a sign.I'm pretty sure Via Brasil takes up the space that was formerly (and quite briefly) a Makino's. It's a nice, large, and elegantly decorated restaurant. As soon as you step inside, you know you're in for a culinary treat.After you're seated, they explain the red/green system - green of course meaning that you're ready for meat! My card stayed green for most of the night. To put it succinctly, Via Brasil serves up some of the most amazing cuts of meat I've ever eaten. Sure there were some items that weren't quite up to par, but most of it was absolutely awesome. To be honest, it's all quite a blur. They just kept coming and coming and coming. And I just kept saying yes yes yes!Surprisingly, I didn't enjoy the bacon-wrapped tenderloin that much. It was the weirdest and most unexpected thing. I actually thought the bacon got in the way of the flavor! On the other end of the spectrum, the last cut I received was some sort of garlic-infused meat. Looking at their web site, I think it is the "Noble Cut of Picanha in Garlic." Wow. I was full by that point, but that didn't stop me from getting a second cut. It was the perfect ending.If I ever go back, I think I know what strategy I would employ. I noticed that the cuts of meat I enjoyed most were light and very much on the rare side. The cuts I didn't enjoy as much tended to be dense, which caused them to be not as tender and way more filling.Oh I should mention the salad bar. You might think one would ignore it. The reality is, you need something on your plate to balance out that meat. It's really much more than just a salad bar and the choices are mostly delicious, but definitely use that only as a complement to the meat. You are here for the meat!One thing I didn't realize is that dessert is not included. I couldn't resist getting some of their Tiramisu. It was pretty good, but not sure it was worth the extra $8. I know it's a silly thing to mention since the Rodizio meal is $43, but it's good to know.OK this is long enough. Way too long. FOUR STARS!Wow!  What a great meal! The waiter comes to your table with a bread basket with several doughnut hole shaped buns.  They are Brazilian cheese buns dusted with parmesan cheese.  There were excellent!I started with the salad bar and took items sparingly.  I tried the cold, sliced portabello muchrooms, one tomato caprese, asparagus risotto, two small artichoke heart halves, and two large shrimps and a piece of fish from their hot seafood mixture.  This was the extent of my salad bar foray as I didn't want to fill up on salad.  It would be a great dinner in itself.I turned the coaster to the green side meaning bring on the meat.  Before they started that, a waiter brought three dishes to the table - one with 3 fried plantains, another with mashed potatoes, and a third with green beans with garlic.  These were my vegetables to go with my meat.  A lot of food to accompany a lot of food.I didn't try all the meats as I was filling up before they had a chance to bring everything to my table.  I liked the small sausage, the first meat I tasted and it was excellent.  Beautiful seasoning.  Then I had two thin slices of rare prime rib which was excellent also.  I had both the chicken breast wrapped in bacon and the tenderloin wrapped in bacon.  Both were very good.  The seasonings were perfect.  I am a salt user extraordinaire, but I salted nothing except the mashed potatoes and green beans.  I had the garlic picanha (top sirloin) and it was superb!!  I also had one slice of beef rib which is sliced from a rack of rib (large--not baby back) and served on a separate small plate. Since there were only two tables occupied in the restaurant, there weren't several guys walking around distributing meat like rodizio restaurants.  Two guys were tasked with the serving.  I didn't get the pork loin and I forgot Tony's mentioning of chicken hearts--damn, damn, damn.  Well, something to look forward to next time.After all this, I did hold back so I could try some dessert.  I had a slice of peanut butter, chocolate chip cheesecake.  Oh yeah--great!Service was impecable.  My iced tea was refilled often, staff was always around to answer questions or see if you needed something.  I was greeted at the door by a delightful young lady and she also bid me a kind, smiling farewell!The place is very nicely done.  I love the wine rack that goes almost to the ceiling.  I could see the super ladder inside to extend and reach the highest shelves.This is a great deal with a Groupon.  The Groupon was $21.  The regular price for the rodizio is $42.95.  I'm not sure I'd be back for the full price, but the Groupon certainly makes it a great deal.  Come on Groupon--let's get anohter Via Brasil.  And you know, I'll probably go back and pay the full price if one of my friends from out of town who loves rodizio comes to Las Vegas.  We'll go together!My husband made a reservation for the family on Friday night for 7:30.  We had a groupon and wanted to use it, so that was the biggest incentive, plus payday meant I had money to spend.  The long week at work also meant I was ready to relax and eat good food.Walked in and our table was ready.  The service was amazing!  Since it was our first time, we had to learn a little about the process.  Everyone was very attentive to us all.  We got clean plates every so often, and water was refilled before it ran out.The food was delicious.  My 3 year old could not get enough.  The salad bar had risotto, salad, seafood, mushrooms, rice, and other inviting items.  There were also side dishes you could order.  We got fries for the kids, and asparagus and collard greens for hubby and I.  Then came the meat!  When I turned my card over to green, the servings came nonstop!  There was skirt steak, top sirloin, pork rib, beef rib, prime rib, bacon wrapped turkey, bacon wrapped beef tenderloin, pork tenderloin, chicken legs, frog legs, my  favorite corn, and I don't remember what else.  By the end of dinner, my 3 year old kept asking for more steak!  They brought some out just for him.  For dessert, we had the creme brulee.  It was a huge portion that all of us could share.  It was nice and creamy, not to sweet and was a nice finish to a fantastic dinner.For all four of us, our bill with the groupon came out to 73 and change.  I tipped 20.  The pricing is great especially since the kids are free.  I definitely think it is worth the money.  If you want to go to Via Brasil, but are on the fence or think that it is a lot to spend, I would say GO GO GO.This review is for my visit for Brunch, only available on Sunday! Rodizio style baby!Brunch is 24.99 pp normally however I joined the on line e-club for free and was immediately sent via email an invite for 19.99 pp, hell yeah! FYI kids under 5 eat free. All you can eat/AYCE!Wow, I came across this restaurant and brunch info by accident while browsing the web and I am sure glad I did!The description of the brunch was mouth watering and I have been dreaming of going for four weeks now, was just waiting for a Sunday that my boyfriend did not work.Complimentary drinks, fresh squeezed pineapple, strawberry and orange juice are available for $3.50 per glass.They have a beautiful super fresh hot and cold Gourmet salad bar, that includes lobster bisque soup, bacon, sausage, hashed browns, cheese blintz,  and many homemade salads and a delicious ranch dressing! I really enjoyed the Caprese salad mmm yum and they have bottles of the best Olive oils around that you can use. My boyfriend really enjoyed the roasted peppers and eggplant. This is just listing a few as they have close to 35 items in their hot and cold gourmet salad bar!Fresh omelet station, eggs benedict or eggs any style for your own creation made to order, and Belgium waffles made fresh as well!You are given a rodizio marker for your table and when you want meat brought to your table you place it on the green side, and when you have had enough or are working on what you have then you flip it over to the red and they will not come to your table.Mmmm yum they also give you a side of fresh mashed potatoes and some delicious fried bananas which were the best I have ever had in my life!!!!!!They have a cart of fresh banana bread and another bread,  however once she said banana I knew I must have and did not hear what the other was. It was the best banana bread I have ever had the pleasure of eating! I had seconds on that for sure!The brunch is rodizio style so there are 6 choices of meats coming around at all times to make the rounds to your table. They are generous and are constantly on the move making sure you are satisfied and have everything you need or could ever want! List of meats cut table side. Top sirloin, tenderloin wrapped in bacon, turkey wrapped in bacon, prime rib, chicken drumsticks, smoked ham and pineapple. Keep in mind this selection is only for brunch, their dinner service has closer to 16 meats. The bacon wrapped turkey was an explosion of flavor all up in my mouth! The prime rib was delicious and melted in my mouth like butta!The service was Amazing, everyone on staff catering to our every need, refills of iced tea galore, my glass never even had the chance to get half full at any point! They cleared plates, brought plates, folded our napkins back up every time we left the table, they were on it! This restaurant for sure values and appreciates their customers!Heather was an Amazing Server by the way, her smile and sweet, helpful, knowledgeable personality was refreshing. If I owned a restaurant I would love to have her on my staff!This was a real treat for my sweetie and I also was my first time for rodizio style meat service it sure was a winner!We will be back because I know I will be dreaming about this place and be itching to get back really soon!The best service ever in all of my dining experiences I swear! I told my boyfriend that I feel like a Queen totally treated like royalty in every way! They totally spoiled us with anything and everything, I am still Amazed and super happy with our experience. Top quality food and very tasty and creative!You know, they say when someone likes your business, they'll tell 1 person, but if they don't like it, they'll tell 10.  I've been going to Via Brasil for almost a year, and I've loved it until recently.  I still love the Rodizio Dinner, which is expensive but comparable to other Brazilian steakhouses, and the food is delicious.I turned several of my friends on to VB as a go-to happy hour spot.  They used to have a bartender/server named Jules who was AMAZING - orders were quick, accurate, she was witty and attractive (which my single friends appreciated). We would go weekly, or at least a couple times a month.Sadly, I went back three times over the past two weeks, and was informed by the hostess that Jules was no longer there, and their service has plummeted.  The first of the three most recent visits involved delayed drinks, arguments with wait staff about how to split cash and credit card payments on the bill (which are usually over $250 with 6-8 people), and delayed food orders.The 2nd of the last three visits, the same delays occurred.  The waiter tried to blame the kitchen, but when I asked about why my bruschetta (which takes all of 60 seconds or less to throw together) wasn't out after 30 minutes and the rest of my party was leaving, the waiter acknowledged he forgot to put the order in.  THEN, he puts the order in and rather than comp. the order, he charges the full price rather than happy hour price BECAUSE HE FORGOT TO PUT IN THE ORDER before happy hour ended!The last time I went will be the last time I go for happy hour.  I went with two other people.  One of my friend's orders was completely forgotten.  We had trouble getting anyone's attention for new drinks. And, we waited, after we finished our food and drinks, 30 minutes until one of us went to the bar to get our tab for our table.  Then, after another 10 minutes, we ended up having to bring the signed check back to the bar because we'd basically been abandoned at that point.I loved this place...LOVED. My friends made fun of me because I'd always recommend it.  Unfortunately, the service at happy hour has so plummeted that it's not even worth it.  Too many good happy hours to waste time here. Bring back Jules!My hubby has a birthday coming up and he wants Texas de Brazil for his special dinner. Since we had been to TDB before, and not tried Via Brasil even though it is in our area, I figured we could give it a shot. I did have an A-OK experience, but I am glad it wasn't his actual birthday dinner or I would have been disappointed we didn't go to TDB. The "Rodizio" dinner is priced at $45.99 per person. A 50 plus item salad bar is included, and you get to try 18 different meats that meat carvers bring to your table on skewers. You can choose if you want what they have and how much. If pink meat isn't your thing, you can request any of the meat be cooked to to your liking. They give each person there own round paper disc that you turn to green when you are ready for more meat and then you turn it to red until you are ready for more or are simply done eating. I was impressed by the fact that the side dishes were included with the meal. They had like 16 to choose from and you can pick as many as you like. That is a nice touch! They ask that you tell them your sides when you first get there so they can start preparing them. So I am not a vegetarian at all, but I don't eat a whole lot of meat. Tonight was my night to shine as the carnivore I am not. I absolutely succeeded! I first went to the salad bar. I wasn't impressed. There were a lot a seafood options which is great, but not for someone like me who doesn't eat seafood. I didn't feel there was a lot of options for a salad however the veggies they did offer were fresh and delicious. I put some "Caprese Salad" on my plate and that was actually very good. As we finished up our salad, the sides we ordered arrived. The "White Rice" paired nicely with the "Sauteed Mushrooms" and the "Fried Banana" was good. Then the meats started coming! I have to admit that the "Top Sirloin" known as "Pichana" that they claim is the star of the meal was not good at all. The meat was tough and flavorless. The "NY Strip", and "Prime Rib" were the same, tough meat and flavorless. Then came the "Bacon Wrapped Turkey" and THAT is delicious. I'm a huge fan of bacon and the bacon really added a nice flavor to the turkey. Then came the "Garlic Filet and "Bacon Wrapped Filet and these two are the star of the meal to me. The filet was so tender and flavorful. I like my meat cooked well done so the server took note of that and made sure to bring me pieces with no pink. I liked my meal, but can't see coming back and paying full price again. Maybe if it were a deal they had going on or something. The meat at first was not good, and the salad bar was not great. I know this isn't TDB, but I do have to compare it because they both have the "churrascaria" thing going on. And the salad bar at TDB is worth just eating that alone. The sides were decent, but I only enjoyed a few types of the meat so I'd rather spend the extra to have TDB. There is a Happy Hour here at Via Brasil Monday - Sunday from 5-8 pm in the patio/bar. Every Sunday they have a "Sunday Brunch" from 10 am - 2 pm and have different specials for the brunch so you might want to call and ask if there is a theme for that day. They have several options for events and banquets too.Via  Brazil was a 3 star restaurant in my previous review 3 days ago.  That's nothing to be ashamed about.... it just means the restaurant was nothing great, but not terrible TO ME.  Yelp is a site for posting your opinions.  But some guy named Dustin J. had to send me a private message saying:"We are very sorry that Our Happy Hour is too expensive for you. Please visit McDonalds, Taco Bell and other fast foods if this is too expensive for you"It took me a minute to figure out what restaurant he was referring to, but when I found 20 photos for Via Brasil, I figured it out  Congratulations, guys, I will never return to your restaurant and will make sure nobody I ever talk to does either.  Worst marketing ever.Superior flavor, superior quality. Expect to spend about $80 with drinks , tax, and tip.  Pace yourself and plan for 90 minutes to two hours. Save room for dessert... Or don't. Get such wonderful side dishes as collard greens and fried banana... Or don't. Start with a delicious assortment of salad bar items... Or don't. If you want to, just gorge yourself on the sexy, luscious, delicious, beautiful roasted meats. Be prepared to be pampered by a highly-attentive staff. This restaurant could easily be on everybody's "top 10" list for several reasons: price is acceptable when accounting for the highest quality meats, authentic Brazilian side dishes (ask your server), well-stocked bar, and highly-attentive staff.If you are limiting your caloric intake, are a persnickety price-conscious coupon clipper, pressed for time, out for a quick bite, or just a person who is dissatisfied in general, you probably would not enjoy this restaurant. If you respect the value of quality, and the entire Brazilian churrascuria experience, this restaurant is better than others in the Las Vegas valley because of the taste and quality of the meats and the staff.Serves Glen Morangie single-malt scotch and Stella Artois in the bottle, among many many other alcoholic and non-alcoholic choices.Desserts include (among others) caramel flan, chocolate mousse, brigedeiro's ,and cheesecake.Coffee is strong and delicious.This restaurant earns top accolades.I have come to this restaurant many times, and I have seen it go from barely ok, to good, to great... and it may now be sliding back down to just "ok" when it come to their service. And please don't get me wrong, I will be brutally honest in this review, but this is only with the intention of helping the leadership team at this restaurant identify some disappointing shortcomings I saw during my last visit. As mentioned earlier, this restaurant has worked hard to become a really great churrasqueria in Las Vegas, but yesterday's visit left much to be desired. Let me explain. Hosting several family members for the holidays, I was torn as to what restaurant I could take them to so they could experience a "wow" dining experience, so I chose Via Brazil since they had previously earned my business with great service. In fact, Felipe (our usual waiter) is one of the friendliest and most welcoming waiter there.Having said that, this visit was disastrous! It started with a long wait for meats to come to the table, then the waiters were slow, uninterested in serving us and borderline rude. For example, after trying to cut a piece of meat off the skewer onto my plate, a waiter spilled steak fat onto my shirt... No big deal as it was an accident. What really upset me was the waiter was completely unapologetic and only asked me if I wanted something to clean myself up with.  With an obvious YES as my response, he walked away for close to ten minutes and the sent a different waiter with a rag to clean up the mess. Really?! You spill food on a customer and this is your attitude?The second disappointing mishap was their digital frequent diner program. I have been a member for a while but this time it seemed I annoyed the waiter when I asked him to credit me with the visit. In fact, he denied the free desert I had earned (despite there being no disclaimer on the promotion) and then proceeded to give my family members grief about using their frequent diner app because it was "downloaded on the same day of the visit". Are you telling me this restaurant spends money in a rewards program only to have its staff discourage diners from using it? That's a shame. Lastly, here are some other turn offs from the visit: dirty coffee cups, table was not bussed throughout the visit and waiters' appearance, service standards and demeanor left much to be desired. Please fix this!If I could do no stars, I would because we didn't even get a chance to eat here tonight. It's Valentine's day...I get that but if you take a reservation and call it a reservation, you should be in a position of managing your restaurant in such a way that your customers' tables are ready and available for them at the reserved time.  Especially if that time is a 9 pm reservation because according to Open Table at the time the "reservation" was made, it was the earliest time available for a party of 2. AND especially since Via Brasil called me to confirm the reservation yesterday afternoon. Upon arriving (15 min early, I might add) we discovered several other seemingly disgruntled couples standing outside of the restaurant. We walked in to check in for our 9 pm "reservation" and were told that "unfortunately" they were running behind and were only just seating people with 8 pm reservations meaning that our 9 pm reservation would actually be sat closer to 10 pm. So, the reservation wasn't really a reservation...it was call ahead seating booked through Open Table? For Valentine's dinner?  Riiiight. So, thank you Via Brasil...you actually did us a huge favor. Rather than waiting until nearly 10 pm to eat in your obnoxiously loud and crowded restaurant, we went across the street to Honey Salt and were sat right away.  We had an amazing meal for probably half the cost of what we would have paid at your restaurant. Funny thing about Honey Salt...they recognized the couples eat out at a nice restaurant for Valentine's Day and actually brought in extra tables to accommodate more patrons...GENIUS! Bonus points...they handed out roses to the ladies. Honey Salt is our new fave joint near our house. Separate 5 star review coming shortly for them...I am extremely upset that I had such a negative experience at this restaurant. I will start by saying that the two stars is simply for the food. They have really good food that is really authentic and homestyle Brazilian food which is hard to find in Las Vegas. We went to this restaurant a few times in the past few months and have not had the best service which is really a shame. We asked for a table for three. The restaurant was completely empty and had 3 tables seated. The hostess asked us to wait by the door for a few minutes to "see if they had anything available." We were a bit taken back since the entire place was empty, but patiently waited. About 15 minutes went by and the hostess just stood there staring out into space and wouldn't sit us for some reason. It was so frustrating that it seemed like they did not want our business. Being that we were so hungry we decided to just leave and drive 30 minutes to Texas de Brazil at Town Square. Totally worth it because they were super happy to help us and their service was phenomenal. I promised myself I wouldn't come back to this restaurant because I think customer service is the most important thing for me and this restaurant clearly needs to focus a little less time staring in to space and more time focussing on employee development and training.
Bites and Brews=They kept the waters coming without me asking - throughout the night, and dished up one of the best pies of pizza that i've tried so far in Pittsburgh (that's not saying too much - but I def ate my fair share of pizza in my brief stay there). The crust was light and thin - and the pie was smoking with fresh cheese, spicy tomato sauce, pepperoni, banana peppers, and jalapenos. Not necessarily the wildest of spots on a Saturday night, but a nice spot to go if you want to hear yourself speak and enjoy a large selection of beer to wash your pizza down with. Oh and word on the street -  is that if you can finish a whole Large pie of Pepperoni and a slice  - by yourself in one sitting -  you may just get your name scribbled in Sharpie behind the top of the back of the bar.
Crackers & Co Cafe=I liked the big parking lot, decor, and space in the dining area.  We had a party of 10 and they took reservations.  Plus plus plus plus!!!  We were seated swiftly and our server came over immediately to take our drink orders.  She was back right away with our drinks.  We had to wait for some of the others in our party to show up.  After waiting 10 mins, we were noitifed that the others were not showing up.  BOO. We got the server's attention and she came over to take our order.  I ordered the meat lover omlette.  The eggs were a little too done but tasty flavor.  The potatoes were good too.  The service was excellent!!!  Never an empty cup and she bought an extra plate without us asking for the kids.  She even offered togo ice teas for us.  WHOA.
George's Famous Gyros=I was missing my old neighborhood in Queens (shout out to Astoria!) as I sometimes do, and found myself craving a Greek salad. Not just an ordinary Greek salad, but one piled high with fresh produce and charcoal grilled juicy chicken breast. I knew it would be a task to find one near my Old Town apartment, but one day BF had a gyro craving and off we went. After referencing Yelp, we had narrowed it down to George's Gyros and George's Famous Gyros (I'm in front of Ray's pizza! Famous Ray's? No, just original Jerry!). We actually decided on the non-famous George's, but they were closed on Sunday so our decision was made for us. I'm so glad we ended up here, though-it was delicious! We ordered take-out and placed our order at the counter, so we waited about 10-15 minutes which ended up being just enough time to scope out the staff (who have fun with their job which I love!) and the location (with the office door marked "Pirate"). We also enjoyed the soda fountain-this is a Coca Cola establishment, hooray! And they have a good syrup-to-soda-water ration which is hard to find. Now, on to the food...BF's gyro was GINORMOUS and stuffed to the brim with tasty gyro meat. He gave me a bite (so generous!) and it melted in my mouth. He conquered half of it before saving the rest for later, which he said was just as good cold. The fries that came with it were good, but I will warn you that they gave us Hunt's ketchup packets, so make sure you have your own ketchup at hand if you are like me and have an aversion to Hunt's. My Greek salad was even bigger than the sandwich-TONS of grilled, moist, juicy chicken on top of a *big* salad. And they accommodated my request for no peppers or olives (which, yes, I know, makes it not a "Greek" salad but whateva) which was really cool. There was an abundance of fresh lettuce and veggies, and it was more than enough for two meals. It came with two containers of an oil and vinegar dressing, and hit the spot JUST like my fave Astoria haunts. And it came with garlic bread! Super buttery and crispy and plain delicious. Oh! And the kicker was that both meals came to under $20 including tip, PLUS we got two drinks for free since we checked in with Yelp. I will be back for sure!
Hob Nobs Cafe & Spirits=Well after seeing "Paul's" glowing review of a place that hadn't even opened yet, I really feel like panning the place. I guess I'll refrain and give you my straight up review.But first a note to "Paul" your a ass clown douchebag. And noting that "Paul" has never reviewed any other place clearly "Paul" is aligned with the owners which is INCREDIBLY SAD and LAME!!!!Here goes:The interior is absolutely beautiful and a welcome change from it's past occupant (The Willow House). My Latte was quite tasty but unfortunately also VERY weak. I was there on the first day of their "soft opening" and they had yet to install a wi-fi access point (kinda a major thing for a coffee shop in my opinion). I was told that they will supply free wif-fi with a purchase, but that had yet to be setup.The art on the walls was from local artists which I totally appreciate. The seating was varied in style and they had a comfy couch. I'd give this place another star if it weren't for the obvious attempt at gaming the Yelp system.Paul Barzda is the general manager (see: http://www.downtownphoenixjournal.com/2008/09/30/hob-nobs-coffee-house-opening-october-1st), so I'm betting that 5 star first review from Paul B. was written by the new management.Anyhow, I went there for the first time today. I wasn't expecting anything like Willow House, but I was still hoping there would be something worth visiting once and a while taking up their old location. I didn't get that. Instead I got a coffee shop stocked full of pastries from Costco, many staff behind the coffee bar (all with name tag/plates), only disposable utensils and cups made of Styrofoam-type material.I'm pretty disappointed with the latte I had. They were out of anything smaller than a 16oz cup to put it in, so it ended up being mostly soy foam. It also took a very long time to prepare for such a well (too many?) staffed bar.I did enjoy the wood floor and the stained glass that was all over.If you're looking for a quick blah coffee on the run or an over priced pastry or sandwich practically from Costco, than this place is a pretty good bet.Otherwise I'd pass.With the mystery user Paul having deleted his "review" ... and with a return visit I'm adding a star to my previous review.The coffee is still nothing to crow about (try Conspire for the best coffee in town IMHO) but my sandwich was pretty good (but over priced). I just SOOOO want to love this place it almost hurts.Well the interior is stunningly beautiful and it's much improved from what was in the venue before (the dirty hippy coffee shop).Hob Nobs Coffee House is in this quaint little old house on McDowell not far from the downtown area.  Upon entering I wasn't clear as to if I was in a coffee house or a trendy gift shop with art for sale everywhere you looked.  I also did not experience the aroma of freshly brewed coffee as I walked in but I was greeted by a very friendly person behind their counter that offered to make me a cup of joe.Their coffee was congenial and pleasant.  They had a limited amount of the normal coffee house accompaniments ~ a few pastries and cookies~ to coffee.  They seemed to be more of a café or dinner based on what they are offering their customers.  Pizza at a coffee house?  Now that's different...  They have a huge selection of pizzas, sandwiches and wraps.  Salads and a few breakfast and bunch options as well.  It was very difficult to get as comfy as I do in most coffee houses, but then again I'm not sure this is really a coffee house but more of a café "slash" gift shop.  Nothing against the owners and I don't blame them for trying to maximize their revenues through additional avenues other than coffee.  But you might consider changing your name to Hob Nobs Café and gift shop?This is a cool place to meet people for lunch you don't know.  Hear me out ~ Their tables and chairs are not very comfy so it makes it easier for you to end your conversation.  This can be a good thing you know : -)This place is super cute. An historic home converted into a bar/coffee shop/cafe/live music venue. They have a surprising large bottled beer selection including a lot of microbrews. This past Sunday they had a beer of the day for only $2, not sure if that is an every day event, but it was a great deal. When the cashier told me she was out of the beer of the day, she said I could substitute for any other beer for the same price - sweet!Service was very friendly, so whatever problems they may have had in the past they seem to have fixed (or fired!) The seating is cosy, albeit limited. The patio is a nice touch when the weather cooperates. There is artwork for sale on the walls, but struggling artists won't be struggling for long if they sell them at those prices! The problem is, they probably won't sell because of the prices, so the artists will remain struggling.The menu leans to the healthy side, but not to the extent of chickpea and cardboard burgers at Pita Jungle (thank god!). I think they call the sandwiches "Artisan" which is apt. The portions are big and the prices reasonable. I had the Smokey Joe on my last visit and a Reuben the previous time. I think the Reuben was the sandwich of the day, didn't see it on the regular menu this time. Both sandwiches were great. The only negative is the parking. There is a little parking lot behind Hob Nobs, but because 3rd Ave is a one way street going the opposite way from McDowell, you will have to navigate around the neighbourhood a little before you find it. Then you'll find it to be full and you will curse Phoenix's one way streets and drive around the neighbourhood one more time to try and find street parking. It's worth the hassle though.
Flancer's=This place has decent food, cute atmosphere, but the service is problematic. I was stuck in Mesa for training and had lunch there on Halloween. My pal and I ordered lunch and about 20 minutes later it arrived, minus the condiments we ordered earlier. Sadly our server was no where to be found, and then when she finally checked on us, I asked again for ranch, and she said sure- like it was the first time she heard the request. Another ten minutes passed and finally she remembers the ranch and brings it by. At this point the fries were cold, so it was kinda pointless. I understand this is merely WPP, but most other places can figure it out, so maybe this spot can up their game.
Cupz N' Crepes=I love crepes, and as such, I really wanted to try this place out. So, I convinced my wife to go with me for lunch. She's been before and she warned me about the service, but I figured it was just a fluke and it would be fine. Suffice it to say, we came in at lunch time, around 11 and the place wasn't even that busy. Maybe 15 people. The sign said to seat ourselves, so we did, and there we sat unacknowledged for a good 10min. Not even so much as a "hello", or a "we'll be right with you". I think I even saw one of the waiters sitting down watching the tv. I even saw customers getting up to refill their own waters and get napkins for themselves from waiter station. So, we left (without anyone evening noticing), and we will not be returning. I'm the kind of guy that likes to recommend places to his friends, and I will not be recommending this establishment. This is how you lose customers, so take note.
Reuben's=I always take friends and family here, whenever we visit the city. Everyone always loves the steak with mashed potatoes and garden salad. The portion sizes are huge and the price is quite decent. The environment is cute and I never have to wait more than 10 minutes to get a seat.I was very hesitant giving a 5star but the friendly service I received over empowered my experience. As I came in to this "New York style" Deli, i was greeted with a charming smile by suprisingly a lady who didn't seem annoyed I was there like so many of the waitresses I deal with over the past years. She was smilling and wanted me to be well taken care of. There was a huge line for the seatings so I was ready to order to go. I prefer ordering to go in general since they give more portions and I like to see if their packing skills are on point. As I was ordering more than one item, she kindly asked me to go to the counter where there was a handsome young man by the name of "Alex" who assisted me with a nice big smile! He was so sweeet!!!! He took my order very quickly and everything I asked he made sure I got. Service at this resto is DAY and NIGHT if we compare it to Shwartz. The resto itself: this place was jam packed but yet there's ENOUGH waiters to assist everyone and apparently they thought there was not enough people for what they are normally use to. It's a very spacious resto with lots of delicious items on the menu.The Menu and my order: Gosh you do not understand how delicious their fries are !!! I believe the fries I have had were the best fries I tasted in a very very long time !!!!So crispyyyyy and slim not too much mash inside. They're fries and not mash potato. Very well seasoned to perfection.The reason I was hesitant however between a 4 and A 5 star is because of the smoked meat itself. I am not going to lie it was a little dry but I did specify that I wanted medium/fat. I guess they made a mistake. Their coleslaw is to die for !& the potato latkas had such a great authentic flavour.Overall, this place is high on my list of repeats. I am very glad I gave this place a shot !!!! It sure did not dissapoint xD yummmyy
McDonald's=This McDonald's is conveniently nearby the Pepsi Center.It opens late, and was perfect for the post-clubbing crowd I was with.A friend bought me a McChicken sandwich (not sure why, but I appreciated it), which I made short work of - it tasted normal, as expected.My husband, Jim W., teases me because I only have one and five star reviews.  I guess that's what it takes to motivate me.  Apparently, I was really motivated this morning at McDonald's.No one over the age of eight goes to McDonald's for the food.  We either go because it's quick (sometimes) or cheap (not anymore) or convenient or because we are craving that childhood food memory.  So Jim and I met there this morning  (score one for convenient) for a quick snack and chat about the week.While we're waiting for the food I notice a sign that says they have free samples on Monday morning.  I was fascinated by this.  Since when has McDonald's offered samples?  And who hasn't tried their potatoes and needs to know what they taste like?  Who doesn't know the taste of crunchy grease without a reminder?  So, curiosity getting the better of me, I asked for a sample.  I really wanted to see what it was.  That's when I was reminded where, exactly, I was.I was told that there was no way I could have a sample.  When I inquired why that was I was informed that the person accompanying me had ordered what they were sampling.Oh.Though most yelpers know my prolific yelper husband, this woman did not.  In fact, she had no idea who he was in relation to me.  He could have been my husband but he could just as easily been an anal colleague who would rather die than allow me to sample his food, which I assume was the implication in her refusal.Now, I acknowledge that this is a ridiculous nothing of an issue.  But these days I run into more and more silly little annoyances and I just couldn't let this one pass.  You see, the woman was very satisfied with herself, as if I was trying to "get over on the man" (i.e. McDonald's) and she thwarted me.  It's just so stupid.  So, I guess they saved themselves a quarter of a hash brown but they got this nifty review instead.As to the biscuit I did eat, well ... it was McDonald's.
Hal O. Peno's Mexican Cafe=Instead of writing a review I'm going to write a warning. Avoid this place at all costs. If you want a lesson on how to run a successful Mexican restaurant do not come here. From the kid at the hostess stand to the sub par food this was truly a horrible experience.Of course you start with complimentary chips and salsa. Chips were room temp and not a single grain of salt. Both salsas, one mild chunky and another hot and smooth were both lacking salt, garlic and heat, essentially tomato sauce with some red pepper flakes added for good measure.We ordered a quesadilla with green chile ($6.00) and what they call a Hal's Sampler For Two ($15.95) which is a sampling of all their house specials. Pollo Fundido, mini chimi's, flauta's, tostada's and a green corn tamale served with rice and beans. Sounds promising and a no brainer.As soon as the quesadilla arrived we knew what we were in for. The green chile's were of the canned variety and from the first bite, of the old variety. While the cheese was melted the quesadilla was just above room temp and the tortilla was more dried out then actually crisped on a flat top grill. Each bite being worse then the last as the barely melted cheese coagulated around the wet mushy diced chile's. No amount of salsa could save this one, it was d.o.a..Then the sampler arrived, if there were any high hopes of melty cheeses and tastes of thick guacamole they were squashed just as soon as the plate arrived. The plate of beige, had cheeses but were barley melted and like the quesadilla, everything was just above room temperature. Let me tell you, there was nothing redeeming or delicious on this plate. Just a sampler of dried out, deep fried food covered in cheese and some hyper green, bland version of guacamole.After a few bites of this and that we asked for the check and made our way for the door. When I asked our server for a to go menu, she seemed genuinely shocked that I may have thought that the food was good enough to order again. I only needed it to make sure I got the information correct when writing this review. The owner's should be ashamed of themselves. In a market where there is decent Mexican food abound this kind of crap just doesn't fly.
Filiberto's=Today I ate here and the beans were way too salty to eat and the rice was almost the same, but a little more tolerable. Wanted to send it back, but my husband insisted that I let it go. Also, one of the worker's had a child running around the restaurant ( about 5 years old), and he was touching everything ( silverware, napkins, toothpicks) it was horrible!! The child was climbing on the front counter and running back and forth and sliding on the floor. I may give the place another try in the future because I have had good food here in the past. Sorry Filiberto's :(
Le Milsa=Le Milsa, c'est pour les mangeux de viandes. Les serveurs munis de broches fumantes te coupe l'animal directement dans ton assiette; filet mignon, porc, bœuf, saucisses, bacon de dinde.. Overall le concept peut être très agréable lorsqu'en bonne compagnie. J'y suis allée pour l'anniversaire d'un ami. Puisque je suis pas folle de viande, j'ai choisi le saumon, dont la cuisson était parfaite. Il y a aussi des à côtés un peu anodins qui viennent à volontés avec toutes les assiettes, alors j'ai pu manger des champignons et des patates douces quand j'eus finis mon plat et que les autres se délectaient encore de rouge. La bouffe, top notch, rien à redire.Il y a aussi un carnaval en repeat sur des TVs et pendant 30 minutes il y a une danseuse en paillettes qui vient divertir la foule du restaurant principalement constitués d'hommes fêtant a) leur enterrement de vie de garçon ou b) leur anniversaire. C'était quand même drôle.Là où l'expérience a pris un tournant désagréable, c'est au niveau de notre serveuse principale (on a plein de serveurs, mais la je parle de celle a qui faut donner du tip). Nous étions un groupe de 20, et jamais elle n'est venu se présenter ou nous servir de l'eau. Y'a même quelqu'un du groupe qui est aller s'acheter un coke diète dehors au milieu du repas et qui est revenu avec la bouteille dans le resto parce que "hey, elle nous sert pas d'eau et j'ai soif!". Y'a fallu qu'on demande à la pauvre fille qui nous apportait le pain de nous donner de l'eau, elle on voyait la peur dans ses yeux parce qu'elle savait que c'était pas sa job et qu'elle pouvait de faire chicaner. Elle je l'aimais, elle était fine. La serveuse principale par contre, non. Dès notre arrivée, elle nous demande avec son air bête si on veut consommer de l'alcool, et si tu en prends pas, elle va revenir 8 fois te demander si tu veux boire quelque chose, juste pour être sur que tu aies pas soudainement envie de dépenser 60$ pour un pichet de liquide qui ressemble a du carwash. C'était juste ça sa job, nous servir de l'eau et l'alcool, mais on dirait qu'elle a eu 50% dans son test de serveuse. Ensuite vient le temps de payer. Et la première chose que tu entends quand elle arrive c'est OK LÀ SI TU AS PAS PAYER TU RESTES ASSIS. Elle a même limite envoyer chier le père du fêté parce qu'il voulait se lever pour.. Ben pour être debout parce que c'est long 4h assis! Elle prend les facture de la première moitié du groupe, repart.. Et c'est après 30 minutes de disparition qu'on s'écœure et qu'on va la voir à sa caisse. Elle devait avoir de la misère a trouver le bon bouton pour faire les factures qui étaient toutes au même prix parce que le menu est à un prix unique tsé. On a clairement pu observer un échange avec son patron lorsqu'il lui a demandé ce qu'elle faisait et pourquoi tout le monde avait pas encore payer, et qu'elle lui a répondu "ben je fais payer une moitié en première, puis je sors les factures pour l'autre moitié après!" Mais la cerise sur le sundae, c'est quand elle nous dit que quelqu'un a pas payer. Et qu'elle a obligé quelqu'un à payer le repas supplémentaire. Nous traiter de voleur, pardon? On a tous l'immense certitude qu'on a gaspillé plus de 100$ pour deux chez vous, et tu oses nous dire qu'on te doit un repas de plus? J'ai jamais été une grosse mangeuse de viande. Mais là c'est définitif, le Milsa, plus jamais.Shoutout à la ptite jeune blonde qui nous servait de l'eau et du pain. Lâche pas.
Fuddruckers=Was jonesing for a Burger and decided to go to Fuddrucker's.  I love this place.  I would come here with a couple of friends at least once a month when we all worked together.....but that was a couple of years ago, so it was time to see an old friend.When I pulled up, I was surprised to see a sign advertising Free WiFi....perfect, now I found a new place to study!After a few minutes I decided to go with the 1/3 lb Burger Combo ($9.99) and a 1/2 lb Burger ($5.99).  I ordered American Cheese ($.75) on one and Pepper Jack ($.75) on the other.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/AL5YzikrmxwcBzBNLGO7Jw?select=Fctoo65ZB1jpFxM1_zpamghttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/AL5YzikrmxwcBzBNLGO7Jw?select=_PZGFceSYTI1jygSRi5N6AOne of the things I love about Fuddrucker's is the fresh toppings bar where you can load up whatever you want on your Burger.  I decided to put Onions, Jalapenos, Mayo, and Mustard.  I also got some melted Jalapeno Cheddar Cheese for dipping my Fries.The Burgers were tasty of course and the Fries were perfect!  The combo came with a Soda and I went with Coke Zero.....I'm not a Soda drinker, but I think I'm becoming addicted to Coke Zero.....have to stop that soon.Overall, it was another great meal @ Fuddrucker's!Return Factor - 93.5%
La Louisiane=One of our only Cajun restaurants but at least it's a good one, and out in a section on NDG that keeps getting cuter. This place has been earning their reputation for over 20 years, not clichéd decor, just a nice, candlelit restaurant with buzz, good gumbo, and some awesome "dinosaur" beef ribs.
O.Noir Restaurant=This is by far one of the most memorable dining experience I've EVER had. If not the most. The concept is simple. You're trying to experience life as a visually impaired person, albeit only for a short few hours and in a controlled environment.  The main dining room is completely dark - not dark as in "your bedroom when you turn off the lights to sleep" dark, but dark as in "your eyes never adjust, you can't even see your fingers when you hold them up right in front of your eyes!" dark.  You decide your two or three-course meal in advance ($34 and $41 respectively) in a separate room, where you are also led back to at the end to settle the bill.  The selection was bigger than I imagined for a prix fixe menu, including a moderate drink list.   Each course also includes a "surprise" dish which I highly recommend to broaden your experience. You're then led into the pitch-black dining room by placing your left hand on your waiter's shoulder and forming a train with your fellow tablemates. The rest of the dinner continues in this tactile manner - the waiter places your hand on the chair you are to be seated, the waiter passes and collects your plates by brushing them over your shoulder, etc. It's true what they say about other senses being heightened when you lose one. But it may surprise you that they can also betray you - such as voices sounding closer or farther than they really are or your taste buds tricking you to think you're eating something you're not. For example, without giving away too much about the surprise dishes, we incorrectly thought the beef tartar was salmon, which the waiter said was a common observation (er no pun intended).  And I swear there was liqueur in the dessert as I was devouring it, but it didn't. I guess it was wishful thinking. You'll find yourself having trouble cutting up some of the food or determining if you've finished everything on your plate; but don't forget that these are just minor challenges a blind person has to deal with everyday. All was going well for me until near the end of the dinner, when I decided to try something from the person sitting across from me.  I knocked over my glass of water because I had forgotten it was there! I knew it was the right decision not to order red wine that night. We had intended to visit the Toronto location but due to a scheduling conflict, we ended up at the Montreal location and I'm so glad we did. This location has higher reviews due to the calibre of the food, such that the experience was more than just a novelty. And I can attest to this - the food was delicious and I would visit again. Definitely an insightful (pun intended this time) and exhilarating experience you have to try at least once. Food: 4*Ambiance: ????Service: 5* (The waiter was very attentive and came around to check on us often.. but I guess he had to be given the scenario!)Value: 4* (I struggled with this one. $41 is steep for what you get.  But then again, it's an experience you can't get anywhere else.)What an incredibly memorable dining experience. This is the kind of place you'll go to once and then tell people about it over and over again because it was so unique.I think the entire concept is beautiful. O.Noir hires people who are legally blind, a portion of the proceeds go to an NPO that helps the legally blind find work, and you spend the entire evening in a completely pitch black environment -- you literally see NOTHING, which is such an unusual experience for those of us who are used to visually absorbing the food and atmosphere around us. But they say when one of your senses is removed, the others are heightened, which is exactly how I felt here at O.Noir. Taste, smell, hearing, feeling... all those things became so much more important than I knew.  We called ahead to make sure we could eat a gluten free meal, which they were easily able to accommodate. Then we ordered the 3 course surprise dinner, so we were served and then able to guess what we were eating afterwards. We started with a tuna tartare salad (amazing textures), then duck confit with potatoes and apple (the duck was incredibly rich and buttery), and ended with a fabulous creme brulee. All of the food had beautiful, strong aromas and a wonderful variance in textures.More than once I put my fork to my mouth and there was nothing on my fork. HAHaha. I mean, it's soooo dark. Your eyes will NOT adjust to the light because there is none, and you have to put your phone in a locker before you enter the dining room, which your server will lead you to. If you have to use the restroom, call out for your waiter! There is the tiniest, dimmest light ever in the bathroom, but other than that -- complete darkness. I almost felt dizzy until I got used to being in the pitch black and grew more comfortable with all the sounds around me. Don't worry, you get to order your drinks and food in the bar area before you enter the noir-est dining room ever!
True Food Kitchen=Kudos to Sam Fox and Dr Andrew Weil for their new partnership and restaurant concept - I love it!  Seriously, I could eat at TFK every day and be happy...I've been twice for dinner so far, and both times I've sat outside.  Both times I've had great service with Damon as my waiter and the rest of the staff extremely attentive and friendly as well.  (Drinks are constantly filled, dishes cleared in a timely manner, and even the space heaters outside turned on to our liking).  Along with the healthy gourmet menu which I love, the vibe in the restaurant is energetic and fun.During my two visits, I've sampled the following appetizers:  edamame dumplings, shrimp dumplings, and veggie crudites with dip.  I ordered the miso glazed black cod as my entree both visits - (it's served with the perfect miso sauce, tasty mushrooms and bok choy... it's fantastic and each bite of the perfectly grilled fish melts in your mouth).  I've also tasted the turkey bolognese and the butternut squash ravioli.  Desserts I can speak of include the lemon ginger frozen yogurt dessert (served with pomegranate) and although I haven't personally tasted it, I've watched others at my table devour the apple crumble cake. There's nothing I tasted so far that I didn't like and there are so many more items on the menu that I want to try!I hope to go for lunch one day soon as well.  Prices are reasonable and because everything is so healthy, you'll actually feel good after eating at TFK.A couple of suggestions for TFK:1 - take reservations for smaller parties!  Luckily, I haven't had to wait more than a half hour during my visits, but it would be nice if you would take a reservation for a smaller party...2 - make your bar bigger!  There are not enough seats to have those waiting enjoy your delicious drinks!Thanks for two healthy, delicious, and fun meals so far, TFK - and cheers to many more to come!This may be my new favorite!! Everything is trans fat free 100%. The wait was pretty crazy but it was worth it. The whole feel of the place is really cool. I always want to eat healthy but not cook, never can I get both. Lots of places claim to be healthy but after several probing questions I usually find a few things that are tainted with trans fat and high fructose corn syrup. Not here though!!! Being a lesbian I have a lot of vegan/vegetarian friends. (I guess lesbians really don't like meat) They always want to go out but I find that most vegan/vegetarian places have less than good food. They almost always seem like the kitchen would be all dirty. I cant wait to take my non meat eating friends here. Here's what I got The butternut squash ravioli = awesome! The dough is made I think like gluten free or something, which isn't a selling point for me but it was very good. Usually the gluten free noodles are sick, I actually really liked the texture and taste. Its in a yogurt honey sauce, to me sounded a little gross. My gf ordered it but it was delicious, it was the perfect sweetness. It was served hot which I thought it may be cold I guess because of the yogurt factor. I ordered the root veggies. I did really like it but I thought they flavor could have been a little more herby. It wasn't bland but I think the flavor for sure could have been kicked up a notch. The Farro that came with it, was super good. I wish there was more of it especially for 15 bucks. The bathroom was weird, it was really small. The door was thin sheet metal and so was he lock. When you lock the stall it makes the most awefal screechy metal nose. The soap was actually a natural soap which was nice but not antibacterial. Ok, they habd the coolest hand dryer, I mean this thing is bad ass. You put your hands in it like a car wash dryer. I dont know how to describe it but make sure you check that bitch out :)I'm confused a little on this place and here's why. 1)Spiffy new, contemporary interior but it seems more like a fancy Pei Wei than an upscale restaurant. The prep table is in the front of the house, and why do I need to see people cut up vegetables as part of the dining experience? 2) The first thing you see on the menu are fresh healthy fruit drinks then at the bottom of the list they say "add a shot of vodka for $3". Seemed very strange to me. 3) We had great service, actually some of the best I've had in a long time, but there were easily 10+ staffers hovering around as you walked in which kinda made it like I had just pulled into a used car lot with all the salespeople getting ready to pounce on me. I'm guessing there were 30 employees total that night and about 60 guests in the place. 4) Food: Had an onion tart, butternut squash raviolis and a side of fresh green vegetables. Can't complain much food was really good, but in that healthy, locally grown, organic, blah blah blah way. I like this place, but it's in the Biltmore and I don't typically go here often at all. Food is good, simple and fresh so maybe a better lunch stop with the girls than a hearty dinner destination with the boys.8/14Came in for a late lunch.  Place was like a can of sardines, with a line that would've formed outside the door had it not been so hot.  Instead, we all clustered around the host's podium.  Surprised, I was seated almost immediately.  See, there are advantages to dining solo.  Had questions for the server, who had to go back to find out the answers, but at least she did try and was friendly about it.  I asked about the separate dining area at the back.  Don't quote me on this, but I think she said that the room can be reserved for a minimum of $100 expenditure for lunch and $200 for dinner (significance of info will be revealed shortly).Ordered the onion tart, which was comprised of smoky garlic, succulent figs, and pungent gorgonzola, which paired well with the star of the show- you guessed it- caramelized onions.  Loved the thin crust, which was made of spelt and flax flour- great ingredients for those who aren't allergic.  (I'm allergic to many wholesome LDL-reducing, high-fiber, anti-inflammatory, and anti-oxidant enriched foods, but I will gladly suffer a few hours of pain and other discomforts for another TFK onion tart!)Does this place ever slow down?  'Cause that's the only time I'll stop by for another bite to eat.  It was VERY noisy in here (private room would be a great option to look into if with a group), and the nervous energy was at odds with the forest and water moodscape that surrounded me.  BTW, the clip board (made of wood, not plastic or pleather) holding the receipt was a cute touch.  Too bad I spied (well, it really wasn't spying since they were right there in the open!) the kitchen staff stuffing cut veggies into ziploc sandwich bags... y'know those bags will just end up in landfills or the ocean :(This place has all the amazing potential in the world. It's a cool concept and I certainly appreciate the plethora of vegetarian and vegan options they have available, but I gotta say: bland, boring, blah.The hummus was good, but certainly not the "best in the valley" as our waiter purported. I ended up adding salt.My "LTL" (veggie version of the BLT) was very bland. I added salt and that didn't even help. My bread was slightly burned and the potato hash that they gave as a side was cold, limp and you could tell it was burned during the cooking process.The vegan pizza was also pretty boring. It was a combo of olive oil and red sauce. They could have spruced it up with some spices and made it really flavorful, but it definitely left me wanting for more.I appreciate the charcoal water filtration system that helps eliminate "water bottle waste" but I don't know that charging $2 for the table is necessary.The honey lemonade was good but gave me a tummy ache, and the nojito just had way too much going on (honey, lime, ginger, soda water, etc).Our service was good, if not a little overbearing, otherwise I would give this place 2 stars. The food is boring and extremely overpriced. Our casual lunch turned into $50, and there was no alcohol involved.I am all for health and I support the cause, but they really need to do something about the taste of the dishes.Sooo disappointed. Arrived here yesterday with a friend at about 4:15pm. Seated promptly. An over bubbly petite girl approached our table.. (you know the kind.. TGI Fridays "flare" type) speaking in cheerleading tones, we'll call her "bubbles" letting us know our server would be with us in a minute.. right as our server arrived.  There were maybe 5 tables sat including ours in all areas of the restaurant and Ill be damned if our poor server wasnt waiting on every single one of them.. which explains why she wasnt very attentive. Not really her fault..Our food did arrive in a timely fashion delivered by "Bubbles". My friend had ordered the squash casserole and had asked if bread was available for her to order and the attitude and outright snottiness of bubbles next comment decided the gratuity and the fact we will never go back. She said " we dont have bread.. this isnt the Outback." You should have seen the looks on our faces.  She then catches herself and says we have pita and my friend staes "nevermind, that's not what I was looking for". Bubbles goes away and comes back with an order of pita anyway. We sat in silence for a good 5 minutes.. apalled at that little bitch's outburst. As a manager I would have fired her on the spot for speaking to a patron in that manner. After the "incident" and our meal was finished, the plates were cleared and we sat...and sat while our server tended to the rest of her tables. Meanwhile there are 5 servers doing sidework right in front of us.. including Bubbles (who mind you was leaning over the sidework table laughing and not helping her coworkers at all). We made eye contact with several of them hoping they would notice we were looking for our server and nothing. We had actually wanted dessert but by the time our server finally showed we just wanted to leave. Im sure our server would have been great had she had any form of assistance from her coworkers. But the snottiness of the self righteous self entitled Bubbles was inexcusable.Im sure you're wondering about the food.. it's decent but not anything amazing..too many restaurants in Phoenix to come back here for their food, let alone to be talked down to by the staff.Oh and also, we were told their tomatoes are flown in from tuscany.. Seriously? In this economy you're flying tomatoes in from Italy and not supporting your local markets..FAIL03/11/10Had a fantastic breakfast today!!  After a meeting at work, I asked a couple of coworkers if they'd like to join me for breakfast.  One is a health nut like me, so I knew he'd be up for breakfast at TFK.  Thank goodness I'd mentioned for them to look for The Cheesecake Factory, or they'd never have found the place.  (BTW, what is up w/ the paid parking there these days?  It had been awhile since I'd been there last, and I was much relieved to find that two-hour parking is free w/ validation, or I'd have to stop dining at The Biltmore.)After waiting a long while for them to arrive, I went ahead and placed my order for Wild Sockeye Salmon Lox since it didn't seem like my coworkers were going to make it (no contact #s and they weren't familiar w/ the area) and I either read breakfast hours wrong online, or the times had been extended (the website currently posts correct hours), and I wanted to have breakfast, not lunch!  While I waited for my food, said coworkers showed up and stood around not knowing what to order.  I suggested that one of them try the Quinoa Blueberry Johnny Cake, and he readily did when he noticed that ALL included ingredients were on his list of cholesterol-reducing foods!  The other wanted to see what organic eggs tasted like, so she had the Two Organic Eggs.  [I'll go easy on her... she's not a foodie! ;)]The lox dish was a beauty, and it tasted even more exquisite! Generous portions of wild sockeye salmon sat on six charred grain bread (made in-house, and, as far as I could tell, indeed had many grains, as well as ribbons of thinly-sliced carrots), creamy labneh cheese (oh my!), and onions, plus sliced cherry tomatoes.  I practically inhaled this platter of food, it was so delectable!  I was almost finished w/ this selection when my coworker's johnnycakes arrived.  Yes, I said cakes-- the menu alluded to just the one.  His plate included three beautiful johnnycakes, with blueberries cooked within, as well as fresh blueberries added on top of a huge dollop of Greek yogurt and Maple Grove Farms' organic maple syrup (no need to reach into my purse for my own!  LOL).  He was gracious enough to let me sample, and so I did!  I was greedy enough to order my own plate of johnnycakes-- I ate all but half of a cake!The other coworker hardly touched her breakfast.  Maybe she wasn't hungry.  Maybe she didn't like the taste of organic eggs?  Maybe, maybe.03/23/10Came back for more quinoa blueberry johnnycakes AND a take-out of savory Greek frittata!  As pictured, the open-faced omelet, which included organic eggs, slices of red onion, kalamata olives, tomato, feta, and oregano, didn't look appetizing, but don't believe your eyes!  This tasty selection was highly-satisfying, and I'm sure, given its chance to make its debut graced over a pristine plate, it would have made for some quality food porn!  ;)  Check out the portion size of accompanying grain bread!  Look closely, and you can spot some of those carrot strands I wrote about earlier...I really must try dinner here someday, but only if I can secure that private room in the back.  It's too noisy out in the main dining room...Smoothies and Omelets and Johnny Cakes Oh My!True Food Kitchen is by far one of my favorite spots in the Valley, and definitely my favorite Fox concept.  I was a huge fan before, but now with the addition of breakfast on the menu, I could eat at TFK for every meal and never get bored... While I have my favorite menu items for each meal, I do mix it up now and again.  However,  do not - I repeat, do not go to TFK for breakfast unless you are going to get at least one order of the Quinoa Blueberry Johnny Cakes for the table.  Served with pure maple syrup and Greek yogurt, this dish is a godsend from heaven!  And while I'm here updating my original TFK review, I have to add that service is always fabulous.  Damon has a special place in my heart as he was my first ever server, and continues to be friendly and attentive when I get seated in his section, but I've had numerous other servers, and they've all been awesome.  I hope that the new Scottsdale Quarter location will be just as successful as this one.Until next time, TFK - see you soon!5/29/10Came in after a failed attempt to dine at Zin Burger next door (I ended up ordering only the sweet potato fries there- not good.  Very soggy.).  Nice friendly greeting at the door, and I was seated right away.  (Sad to see TFK's business was much slower than that of ZB's.)Ordered my favorite, the onion tart, but I also wanted to try something new- the Columbia River steelhead salmon, which the menu promised it comes with shiso (red or green leafy greens), lime, avocado (hold the avo, please!), and cilanto aioli.  It is served on the bread made in-house.  For dessert, I tried the chocolate muffin/cake w/ organic butter ice cream, organic chocolate sauce, and cocoa nibs (!).The salmon sandwich was excellent!!  Everything that comprised this sandwich was fabulous, from the whole-grain and veggie bread and the lime and cilantro aioli slathered on it, to the oh-so-moist medium-rare salmon, tomato, and the not-so-usual leafy topping, shiso.  It took all my willpower to not eat the entire thing!  I wish I could say the same about the kale salad and sweet potato hash...  The kale was so tough to chew.  However, chewing wouldn't have been such a task if the kale wasn't also very dry!  My salad was pretty rough, so I abandoned it right away.  [I know that kale is SO VERY good for me, but sometimes what's good for my health isn't so great for my digestive system :( ]  I wasn't a fan of their hash in the past, and tonight's side dish didn't win me over, either.  I won't give it another chance.  Another disappointment was the onion tart.  First, the presentation left me wondering who took a chunk off my plate and ate it?  No, this was just how it was assembled and baked, I was told.  Variances, he said.  The exquisite crunch I so loved in this pizza was gone, and so was the flavor.  Very bland.  Another menu item I must cross of my list :( Oh, but the dessert!!  Very moist cake, which sat on silky, rich organic dark chocolate sauce, with lovely (!) crushed cocoa nibs- loved that crunch!  I think I surprised my server by guessing correctly what those nibs were!  (I've had them before in trail snack bags from Whole Foods.)  The best part?  Why, the homemade butter ice cream!  I need to go back and have another scoop (or two!) very soon...Excellent service- very informative.  Kudos to my server who never showed impatience after having to answer all of my questions- some of which he had to go back to the kitchen a few times, too!  Thank you very much!Please indicate if the following points are True or False:-   You and Matt were really excited to visit True Food Kitchen during Restaurant Week. TRUE-   Upon arrival, the two of you were happy to be seated promptly without a reservation. TRUE-   The cheerful restaurant décor infused you with organic, healthy, and sustainable vibes. TRUE-  You and Matt really enjoyed sitting outdoors on the cozy patio that was artistically bordered with green grass. TRUE -   The menu's variety of healthy and fresh options initially looked impressive and yummy. TRUE-   It took your waiter about 10 minutes to acknowledge your existence after being seated, even though the restaurant wasn't very crowded. TRUE-   When the waiter finally arrived, he didn't welcome you to the restaurant, introduce himself or even explain the concept behind the menu that Dr. Weil & Mr. Fox created. Instead he looked bored and just wanted to know your order. TRUE -   Waiters at Applebee's have made a better first impression than he did. TRUE -   The seasoned hummus appetizer, topped with a flavorful Mediterranean mix of Kalamata olives, cucumbers, feta and sliced pearl tomatoes impressed both of you. However the amount of time it took this dish to make its way to your table did not. TRUE-  It seemed like the entire restaurant staff was playing a game of "Guess Who?" - waiters kept moronically walking around with food, stopping at different tables and trying to guess who ordered what. TRUE-   At least 4 times (it occurred so frequently you stopped counting), a random waiter placed someone else's food in front of you, and you had to tell them that they guessed wrong. TRUE-  You ordered a salad, tofu teriyaki bowl and frozen yogurt with berries. Matt ordered the smoked salmon, steak tacos and flourless chocolate cake. It was healthy, fresh and good but definitely NOT worth the $100+ bill including a bottle of wine. TRUE-  You both felt robbed. A much more pleasant, faster and cheaper alternative would have been to buy the wine and ingredients from Trader Joes or Whole Foods and prepare this "simple" meal yourselves. TRUE-  A snail could have cooked and served your "simple" meal faster then the 3 painstaking hours it took your waiter. TRUE-  The restaurant's parking validation is only good for two free hours in the lot - but the wait staff decided to play that irritating game of "Guess Who?" and couldn't serve your "simple" meal in less than two hours - so to top it all off, you STILL had to pay for parking, which was beyond upsetting after so many other let downs. TRUE -   Although you liked the décor and really wanted to love this restaurant, you don't recommend it to anyone since you have most certainly tasted MUCH better health food. TRUEThank you for your responses to these True Food Kitchen statements. We are excited for when you return to enjoy more of our overpriced food and overwhelmingly bad service. FALSE!!!I am a huge fan of cooking. I also love places that sell fresh food. After days of hanging by the pool, I decided to get out and venture over to the Biltmore Fashion Park. I checked the photos and figured that the True Food Kitchen was the place for me. I sat at the bar and had a little trouble figuring out what to eat, it all looked great but I was craving fish. I ordered the fish tacos and decided on the Skinny Margarita. It's called a skinny margarita because it's made with fresh juices and not because it's made with that low-calorie margarita mixer. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/XMMLRvV4IMxIGyc4H37LxA#QnIja5A6SwqeJcFfPfZRqAThe margarita was refreshing and my tacos were great. Very light, freshly made and my server Jake brought me two different types of hot sauce. I like it spicy and appreciated it very much. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/XMMLRvV4IMxIGyc4H37LxA#kVbK8jNzkNTAeL2ReBCpMQThe lunch was light and tasty, which was perfect and tasted like something I would make at home. It's very refreshing to find places that are not chain restaurants and serve fresh food you can watch them preparing. That's why I truly enjoyed the True Food Kitchen.What I wouldn't give to have this restaurant that's just bursting with good healthy fresh food - packed with vegetables, no less - in my city.Our party of 5 was seated at a king sized wooden tables, of which there are many. I remark on this because I'm from two cities where they cram us all in so that we're intimate with strangers. I realize I might not mind this too much. We pretty much had to shout across the table to each other, the tables are so large! I'd be more bugged by that if I wasn't so in love with the concept and food. Regardless, it's good to know that large groups can be accommodated (10 probably could have fit at our table!)Our shared apps:-crudité with dips (loved the black olive!) I really *really* wish huge bowls of fresh, crunchy veggies would become an American restaurant trend, ruling over the damn bacon or *insert your unhealthy comfort food* trends that I'm positive only exist  thanks to a backfire that BS fat-free 90s food trend. Anyway, I fully accept such a trend probably won't happen anytime soon. -herbed hummus (divine! It has a unique taste and excellent texture).I ordered and did *not* share because it was so good I conveniently forgot:-the mouthwatering Tuscan Kale salad(one of the best I've ever had in a restaurant)-TLT with avocado(piles of freshness: lettuce, beautiful tomato, lush avocado and crispy tempeh SO plentiful, I should have stopped at one half but I couldn't stop!!)Dessert? Oh, I would have tried, believe me, if half as good as all that preceded it, no doubt would have been incredible. But I was immobile by meal's end.True Food is the healthiest franchise I've ever had the fortune of experiencing! Here's to hoping they branch out to New Orleans.Fresh, healthy food and great service in a bright, open space.  The servings aren't large and the prices are high for the portion size, but everything is interesting, genuinely healthy and delicious.  Love this place!I've come here for breakfast in smaller and larger groups (2-6) and the service is always on point.  The market scramble is lovely (not heavy with oil like a lot of breakfasts, yet quite filling), as are the Quinoa Johnny Cakes (they just taste like fluffy, delicious pancakes - get the yogurt on the side to make sure you like it as a topping).The also have wonderful lunch/dinner options! A few favorites include the shitake tofu lettuce wraps (wow! flavor) and the new seared spicy tuna wrap (my friend tasted it and said, "Woah!  I didn't know tuna could be this good!"), the red chili shrimp and the spaghetti squash casserole (this one is a little smaller, so get an appetizer if you're hungry).The regular drinks, like the Cucumber Refresher, are absolutely delicious, but the Juby True juices are quite hit-or-miss, according to a few juice-loving friends.
The Tamale Store=Anticipating a grueling swim team practice in the evening, I went here yesterday afternoon to get a tasty, stick-to-the-ribs lunch. I got two beef red chili tamales and a pumpkin tamale. The beef tamales were scrumptious, as expected. The pumpkin tamale, which I ordered out of curiosity, was excellent! It was rich and just sweet enough to provide a pleasant counterpoint to the savory beef tamales without being dessert-sweet. And for 6 bucks, that lunch sustained me through the afternoon and through the rigorous physical activity of the evening. As I said in my previous review, the Tamale Store is far from where I live, but now more than ever I'm convinced that it's well worth the drive. And I'm planning to get frozen tamales next time so I'll be well-stocked with these tasty treats.Tamales sounded like a perfect late-morning breakfast as we wandered through the Old Town Scottsdale Farmers Market. The list of frozen tamales for purchase at the Tamale Store stand was impressively long, with meat and vegetarian options. The hot, ready-to-eat choices included chipotle chicken and mushroom with cream cheese. The chicken tamal(e) was my favorite, with large pieces of meat and a smoky sauce tucked inside the moist masa. The mushroom one was also good, but not as flavorful. Considering how time-consuming it is to make tamales (my sister-in-law spends hours on them), if there were a Tamale Store in my town, I'd definitely be a regular.As their sign says "unwrap a fiesta" It is a party in your mouth... take that as you will. Meat and Masa.. you cannot really go wrong. I love all their combos that they offer.... I ate off the boyfriend's beef tamales and it was YUMMMMY!!  Another high point from the Scottsdale Farmer's MarketThis review is for their tamales only.  I haven't been to this location, I bought mine at the Phoenix Public Market.OMG these are some of the best tamales I've ever had!!  I've tried the beef with red chile, the green chile chicken, the chicken chipotle and green chile corn cream cheese.  There was plenty of filling and you could even tell by looking at it, what it was filled with.  The taste was amazing, and spiced nicely.  They heat in 2 minutes in the microwave (I left them in the paper wrapper and corn husk) and they steamed inside to a perfect moist and hot tamale for your eating pleasure.  These tamales are exactly the way all tamales should be!I am happy to know I can buy these at the Mesa Farmers Market on Fridays without having to go all the way downtown.  You can be sure I'll stock up again!OH MAH GAWD!Normally I don't *love* tamales because they are relatively dry, but when I saw The Tamale Store selling Tamales at the Downtown Public Market I just had to try one. They have three regular vegan options in addition to two dessert vegan options, and 5 vegetarian options.So, I decided to get a hot Southwest Chipotle and ate it at the market, and got an additional 6 frozen; a combo of Southwest Chipotle, Pumpkin, and Sweet Corn.Well, these tamales are freaking delicious. Incredibly moist and flavorful, but with very few ingredients, and you can pronounce all of them! Their website touts "We use only the freshest produce and extra lean meats. We never use lard or shortenings. We never use preservatives!!" It is OBVIOUSLY true.I love The Tamale Store!!!I am so glad this business sells Tamales at the Downtown Public Market because there's no way I am driving to Cave Creek just to buy them. Don't get me wrong. They are good and delicious, but it's too far of a drive. I'm so pleased that you can call and order ahead and pick them up at the Downtown Public Market. The vegetarian and vegan options are awesome.I've had their Mushroom, Corn and Spinach Tamales and the Polano Chile and Cheese which are both equally scrumptious.But buyer beware, one tamale may not be enough and you will be severely tempted to buy a few more.[Solid 3.5 stars]Not your ordinary tamales.  These are large moist and fresh.  I first encountered them at the Phoenix Public Market on Saturdays and occasionally on First Fridays, with steamers full of a variety of tamale flavors to please the Vegan, Vegeterian and meat lover alike.  With fillings from traditional Pork Red Chile and Beef Red Chile to Spinach Mushroom, Shrimp, Chicken (red or green)  or my favorite Green Chile, Corn with Cream cheese.  You have to check out their menu of choices they always seem to have something new or seasonal.  They have them warm in steamers or frozen to take home for later.  [They defrost and reheat very well.  Reheat in the wrap or wrap a moist paper towel over the wrapped tamale to ensure it won't dry out.]A fan of their moist delicious fluffy masa, I am not a fan of the shrimp tamale I had and the tamale traditionalist part of me found that the Pork Red Chile had too much cumin for my flavor.  I can always count on the goodness of the Green Corn Tamale (Corn, green chile and cream cheese).When I forget to pick up a few on Saturday I can always find them in the freezer at Phoenix Public Market.I was inspired by Michael's Review of the Day yesterday to write on Tamale Store, because quite frankly I haven't had any lately because we just exited the official Mexican tamale season AKA, the three months where every hispanic relative in the state makes gazillions of dryish to OK tamales and you have to eat them because you are related and they think theirs are the best on the planet, so you better tell them they are or they are going to smack you on the back of the head- season of good cheer.But back to the task at hand. Tamale store. We were introduced to them at the begining of last year on a day trip up to Payson, where we noticed they had just started up a Farmer's Market in the Chili's parking lot on Highway as you enter town. Heck yes, we decided to stop. Lots of great stuff there, you should definitely check it out, but most notably were the tamales! I claim tamale tasting expertise based on the 27 years of consumption,and yes these are Fantastic. I became a rabid fan of their green corn, red beef, chicken chipotle. And I will never pass up any opportunity to buy these scrumptious moist delicacies.Beside the amazing tamales, the staff is INCREDIBLE. They taste out their tamales to everyone that wants some, and bags up the orders with a true awesome love for what they do. They are very helpful and informative for the tamale retarded and find the flavor that you are going to love. They have veggie and vegan options which are great. And they sell out fast. The girl told me later in the season on another visit, that they always sell out in Payson, so if you go to this market, head to this booth early. They drive up from Cave Creek, so what they have for that day is IT.Don't pass this place up.Oh, P.S. In case you were wondering....way WAY better than anything my family made this "tamale season"  (luckily none of them have any clue what Yelp means)I like how you can buy assorted tamales by the dozen.I love tamales, so when I saw this place on Yelp, I knew I had to try it. The draw for me, besides the rating, was the selection - several types of tamales including a couple vegetarian, vegan, and dessert options. There's something for everyone! Their website also boasts, "NO lard, shortening, gluten, preservatives, MSG, soy, trans fats, high fructose corn syrup, or junk here." Fabulous!You can place an order via telephone, e-mail, or form on their website. I really like the convenience of the electronic options and it ensures there's no miscommunication on your order. They recommend placing your order within 24-48 hours. I placed mine a day in advance and everything went very smoothly. I used e-mail and received a prompt response.The interaction at the store was just as painless as the ordering process. The store was easy to find with the large "TAMALES" on the plaza's street sign. It's a cute shop with a counter and comfortable seating. It took a couple minutes to locate our order in the back, then we paid and that was it! The tamales are sold in sets of two, sealed, and labeled. I was really impressed with the packaging! We ordered two dozen and they were frozen for pick-up, which was great. Prices: Pack (2) is $5.50, 1/2 Dozen is $16, and 1 Dozen is $28. You're obviously getting the better deal with the dozen. The price difference is not vast (42 cents per tamale between the pack and dozen costs), but for each dozen, that's $5 in savings!Heating instructions: Microwave frozen tamale wrapped in damp paper towel for four minutes (with wax paper and corn husk intact) OR steam frozen tamale for 35-40 minutes on medium heat (with wax paper and corn husk intact). I used the microwave option and it worked perfectly!The moment of truth: How do they taste? Well, I'm sure you already guessed from my five-star rating that I'm in love. THEY'RE AMAZING! We started with the Pork Red Chile, which I was most excited since I LOVE adobada sauce and it exceeded my expectations. The masa is moist and very flavorful, all their meats (chicken, beef, pork) are tender, and the amount of sauce is perfect. Oh my gosh, the FLAVOR!! We also had Chicken Chipotle, Chicken Green Chile, Beef Red Chile, Tex-Mex, and Poblano Chiles & Monterey Jack. We really liked the flavor of the Chicken Chipotle and there's a little kick. Their chile verde is so, so good! I can't believe I missed Chicken Mole on the menu, so that's on my list for the next order! Favorites: Pork Red Chile, Chicken Green Chile, and Chicken Chipotle. I REALLY like the red chile, so I'm sure all the meat options taste great in it. I didn't care for the Tex-Mex one, so I'd pass on that.I will definitely be ordering more tamales during my future trips to Arizona! Oh yes, they traveled the 300 miles well and we are still enjoying them.
Edo Garden Monona=This was my first All You Can Eat Sushi (AYCES) experience, so I don't have much to compare to in that department. From what friends told me, however, the price is good at $25 a person, which include tea/soda, miso soup, and salads. Also, from what I understand, the AYCES "rules of the house" are on par with other places. We had a group of about 16 people and the restaurant accommodated us quite well. Surprisingly, service was prompt, especially given our large party. Drinks came out within a reasonable amount of time (and the drinks are cheap!!). Miso and salads came out quickly. The sushi itself was tasty and fresh, but not the best that I've eaten in my lifetime.AYCES rules - each person can order 2 rolls or 10 pieces of sashimi at a time. One must eat all of said pieces before ordering more. If any specialty rolls or sashimi are left on the plate at the end of the meal, you get charged for them. AYCES Survival TIP: Go with a group!!! If you don't like something that you ordered, someone else will! If you don't finish a roll, someone else will! For all that we ordered, not a bad price at $25 a pop. They even let us bring home the specialty rolls that we did not eat (and were charged for). I was so full that I probably won't want sushi for another year, but I would recommend the experience at least once in a lifetime.
Terrasse Lafayette=Terrasse Lafayette has a wide sunny patio on a leafy residential street in the Plateau Mile End area, and specializes in large portions of generally super satisfying Canadian comfort food. These days we don't live next door so we're more likely to order in than mosey down, and our order of choice is usually the Lafayette Special lasagne (or switch the noodles for penne or whatever you prefer.) It's oven-baked, the regular size is mega, and the large has got enough cheese, mushrooms, pepperoni, bacon, smoked meat, green peppers to get you through a couple of those long, cold Canadian evenings well fed. Bonus - one time when they were particularly busy and our order took a long while to arrive they immediately offered us a gift certificate for our next order. Very thoughtful and much appreciated!
Off the Strip Bistro & Bar=Just a quick review about some take out Cheesecake from this place......My husband and I went by this restaurant last night to try some of their cheesecake that we heard 'Is To Die For!'We walked in and were greeted by the friendly bartender who told us for take out just go to the back where the cash register was and they could help us with our order.  First off, the ambiance for this place is really nothing to write home about and is very boring.  So we weren't impressed with that aspect of it. Like I said before, the bartender was nice, but I can't say the same for the guy at the cash register!He was rude.  No greeting, no smile, and seemed bothered that we were only ordering the Cheesecake to go.  We even told him that we heard that the cheesecake was 'To Die For', and he didn't even blink.....he took our payment and said, 'It'll be up in a minute'......I wanted to come back at another time and try and entree or more, but not now.Service is a HUGE part of a business, and the service here made this customer not want to ever come back to this place again. We also will not be recommending this place to any of our friends or family.....As for the cheesecake.....My husband liked it, but I've had better!Vegas Yelpers, you all have way too low standards! I can't trust your recommendations here!I went here with my husband and some of his coworkers and it was definitely below mediocre across the board.Food:With great food, I can overlook just about all other aspects of a dining experience. Unfortunately, Off The Strip did not have great food (or even good for that matter). The ingredients and preparations were all things I could make at home. Nothing was very innovative, although many dishes were overly complex with the addition of a ton of ingredients. I think an effective dish embraces simplicity and transforms minimal ingredients rather than adds a truckload. In addition, a pet peeve of mine is when restaurants don't disclose on the menu or by the waiter what will show up on my plate and this place was a major offender of that. (I don't need the secret recipe; I'm just looking for an idea of major flavors and ingredients!)For example, the Caesar salad dressing was so strongly flavored of raw garlic (not even roasted to get the flavor without the "whoo"-factor) that I couldn't eat more than two bites! I LOVE garlic. I eat it raw in slices as I cook; I roast it and have it with a meal; I am obsessed with The Stinking Rose in San Francisco, a restaurant dedicated to the obscene use of garlic; but tons and tons of raw garlic in a Caesar dressing is really just offensive. And to boot, the menu made no mention at all of a garlicy Caesar.Another example of overly complex food without prior warning on the menu was the mashed potatoes. They had crispy pieces of burned cheese surrounding the serving, which I'm not a huge fan of but I know some people like it. But they also had something else in them that I still can't place. It was more of a scent than a flavor, and honestly it smelled like just a hint of artificial vanilla extract, or some sort of pastry like scent. After I pointed it out other people detected it too. I'm still trying to figure it out. Mascarpone? Someone dropped some cheesecake in the mashed potato pan? Some overly ambitious chef attempting vanilla mashed potatoes? Sounds bizarre ...because it was. (And it was another part of my meal I only had a couple bites of.)The "fresh baked bread" was one of those half cooked loaves from the grocery store that you stick in the oven. Fresh... Half baked? Except it was a little stale like it sat under a warmer or something, so maybe just half baked.The crabcakes used really really really low grade crab meat, with not a hint of lump, and possibly a hint of fish. It could just be because I'm from New England but I don't find crabcakes without lump meat even worth eating.The "pesto" garlic bread contained not even a hint of pesto, just more overwhelming garlic.Oh, and their "famous" cheesecake was nothing to write home about.Atmosphere:They need to hire a decorator  or something!! They had bare beige walls with a single painting. (Although I did see two paintings sitting on the ground looking like they needed to be hung.) The place had plain old recessed lighting; cafe tables with cheapo diner style chairs; no booths; and no mirror, no soap, and no towels in the ladies' room.  No ecoutrements in the ladies room would be inexcusable at Denny's but at a place running about $50/person it's awful. Service:First on the good - the male waiter was on the ball. He accidentally brought me the wrong vegetable and corrected his mistake without me pointing it out. He was decently nice and looked professional in a branded shirt.However, the female waitresses seemed like they belonged in a different restaurant entirely. One was wearing just a tanktop, which seemed way inappropriate for a place where many customers were wearing button-downs and nice pants. The other was wearing a glittery PBR hat and selectively called people "hon," which I find even more annoying than calling everyone "hon." The "hons" at the table were me, the only female with our party, and two of the younger guys at our table. When people dress up to come get a steak and pay circa $50 a person, such casual/ unprofessional waitstaff totally doesn't fit.Value:Ugh, just go to the strip. It's bad food, but even if it were good food it wouldn't be worth it.Appetizers run about $15-$20 and are hardly shareable. The rolled New York includes four small pieces; the mussels are scant. My filet mignon was $34. I'm pretty sure that's around what Morton's charges!!My soda was $4!! They have an awful meager selection beer and nothing on tap yet charged my husband $7 for his beer!! Basically, so not worth it.Lobster Ravioli and Chimay Beer... enough said! kudos to the adorable decor and amazing service! i recommend the place to everyone.Food smelled great when we walked in (2 of us), asked for a table, 2 waiters consulted each other, one waiter said it would be a 5 minute wait, just sit at the bar and we'll get you when your tables ready.  Sat at the bar, 1 woman on one end watching TV halfway thru her meal, a couple halfway thru their meal on the other, we chose the middle seats allowing 3 empty chairs either side of us, so we are pretty visible and alarmingly drinkless and menu-less.  Bartender made no eye contact for 10 minutes despite walking back and forth several times serving the already eating diners.  We then saw 3 ladies walk in who also were told to wait at the bar til their table was ready.  So in the ten minutes we were at the bar, those girls who arrived after us were served drinks and handed menus, bar back walked past the bartender who saw we were sitting there awkwardly asked us if we needed anything, told him we were waiting for a table, brought us water, we asked barback for 2 shots honey jack, he told the bartender and went to do his other duties.  So ten minutes after that i watch the bartender make 6 drinks for a waitress, close out the 3 ladies tab AS THE WAITER SAT THEM TO A TABLE, (mind you they came in about 10 minutes after us), still no shots we ordered or eye contact from bartender as he passed us a dozen more times.   So 30 MINUTES LATER, our waiter skipped us and gave away our table, bartender ignores us, 2 different waiters forgets about us, shots ordered forgotten about, we look around for assistance, bartender deems not important to remind staff we've been waiting for a table.  We get up slowly making our way to the door, no one notices us and we leave.Service from bartender: NEGATIVE 10Service from waiter: JUST PLAIN FOR GOT ABOUT US.Service from barback: OUTSTANDING.So if you are a cute couple looking for good service and wanting to eat something, anything, look else where,  if you are 3 nice looking cougars, don't worry, the staff will easily ignore waiting patrons and skip the others before you and seat you priority.  NEVER COMING BACK, don't like being ignored and forgotten.   Garlic bread did smell good though. (Don't know if that's on the menu because never received one.)The food is way too salty. We didn't even touch the meatloaf after the first bite. The service is welcoming but slow. If it is not one of the very few selections at this local area, I wouldn't come and I won't come back as well.
Fleming's Prime Steakhouse & Wine Bar=My wife and I delayed our birthday dinner (ours are just a couple weeks apart) and finally went last night.  It's been a while since we've been to Fleming's so we were both looking forward to it.We had reservations and were seated promptly.  LeAnn was our server and she was awesome.  She recommended the Eponymous Cab.  It was pricey at $20 per glass.  But worth it.  Nice, well balanced cab.We started off with the toasted mushroom ravioli.  Delicious.  Filled with tender mushrooms with a butter porcini sauce.  How to get all the sauce?  How about that mini loaf of sourdough they bring you!  We both ordered filet.  My wife ordered the porcini crusted filet and I had the main filet.  Both medium.  We ordered the garlic mash and roasted baby carrots.The steaks- cooked perfectly.  The manager came over a couple minutes after we cut them to make sure they were to our satisfaction.  They were.  I had a side of peppercorn sauce with mine as well.  Fantastic.The sides- the mash was nothing special.  But those carrots?  WOW!  Don't think of grocery store carrots when you think baby carrots.  Not even close.  The carrots were roasted with golden raisins and slivered almonds.  Those could have been the best part of the meal if I wasn't such a steak lover!  LeAnn gave us a complimentary box of chocolate truffles as well.The food was fantastic but the service was above and beyond.  We will definitely be back!Crème de la crème experience!The 5 for $6 happy hour at the bar is nothing short of fantastic.  What does 5 for $6 exactly mean?  As I found out, it means they have 5 options of food or drinks for $6 each.  Happy hour ends at 7pm.The drinks and food are superb.  I tried the burger and brie puff and they were very tasty and filling.  The service was also exemplary.I am an instant fan of Fleming's and will be a return customer.We have dinned at the Scottsdale Fleming, it was excellent service and outstanding food.  I was so dissapointed that this Glendale location does not measure up!  The decor and atompshere is there but just not the same.  Looks like it, doesn't feel like it.  We were greeted immedately and seated as our reserved table for 6 (Saturday night - before Mother's day).  The wine list was fancy (electronic tablet).  Our server was just NOT attentive at ALL and made the experience basically SUCK.-She never mentioned the specials for the day (the list on laying on the table, someone discovered it later)-She brought the wrong beverage-She has to come back to ask was we ordered because she couldn't read her handwriting-Never was around to grab her attentionNow to the food, two of our group stressed that they needed they meats cooked well done.  One of the filet mignons was to be butterflied to make sure it is well done and the other sliced filet migon was to be well done.  Well, the ladies got their filets and they are still oozing blood.  Come on a butterflied filet migon and a SLICED filet migon not well done?  Really???  Especially on the sliced one, when you slice it and see blood and pink = NOT well done.  We had to send the 2 plates back.  The guest of honor had to sit was watch some of start to eat.  Don't get me wrong, my steak was perfect and tasted great.  You are a steakhouse, getting steaks cooked to the right temperature is your forte!  I am surprised that a Manager was not send out to appoloize or at least talk to the table when we had to send back 2 of the 6 main entrees.  He came by at the end to do a quick hello and how was everything...  Well, it sucked but nothing you can do now at this point!Came here for the first time with some lovely ladies for steak and cocktails after work one night and it was amazing!What can I say about such a superb place?  Our waitress was the most cheerful and sweetest lady ever.  Even when we were mulling and being indecisive over which cocktails to get, she gave friendly suggestions on what's delicious [she has excellent recommendations --- I wish I remember her name].  We all had the prime rib and every steak came out cooked perfectly.  Not exactly up to Mr. W's steak-perfection but the closest thing to a perfectly cooked steak prepared by another person.  Even though we wandered in a little after 9PM on a weekday, we were given such great service and a really satisfying meal.  I would definitely be back!My brother and I were in the mood for a good steak and came to Fleming's.  The place was crowded but we managed to get a table in the bar area.  The ambiance:  typical steak house wood and leather.  Pretty and warm.  The service:  Our server was very good. Once or twice we kind of felt like we had been forgotten and our server admitted that she thought we had been taken care of, but generally it was really good.The food:  We got the special which was a filet and vegetables.  We ordered some extra mashed potatoes on the side.  I have to say that I have had better steak.  It was not as tender as I would have expected and the flavor was seriously lacking.  My brother asked me halfway through the meal what I thought and, being tactful and not wanting to make him feel that this wasn't such a great choice, I pointed out the positives.  He said he was underwhelmed. Gotta say that we both pretty much thought we had much higher expectations for the price point and the reputation.  I have been to other Fleming's and felt I had better food.  The vegetables and potatoes were good but not fabulous.  Fleming's, you didn't wow me on this trip.  Maybe next time...Would have liked to rate this better.  But they closed before the closing time, and as I pulled the door for my wife, I discovered it was locked.  Someone looked at me through the door, turned and walked away.  Not even a "we're closed", probably because they knew it was before 10:30.  This was on June 26.  So we didn't have an opportunity to eat there.  And it's unlikely we'll come back.  Actually, I'm quite sure we won't.So we made the best of it and went next door to BJ's, and had a fantastic dinner there.   Granted, it was our anniversary and we were eating deep dish pizza, but we've been together long enough to roll with it and our waiters there was fantastic, personable and offered great suggestions.I'm sure the West Valley will have more steakhouses soon, and we'll try those out as they arrive.  Really poor show, Flemings.We were introduced by our host to two waiters who evidently forgot their GPS at home, because they couldn't find their way back to our table.  After being there for over 1.5 hours, we finally received our food (and only after reminding the staff that we weren't sitting there because we love their carpet and think they just have the darnest chairs in the world).We were not asked if we wanted a wine refill until the 1.5 hour mark when we also asked them for the whereabouts of our food.  We received our food shortly thereafter, despite putting in our orders within 15 minutes of being seated.  There was no apology or explanation for why our food took so long, despite the tables around us being empty.  Our waters were only refilled once.  If not for the amazing company I was with, I would have left at the 1 hour mark.Food wise.. I was not particularly hungry so I ordered a salad and a side dish (lobster tempura) as my main course.  I fully regret asking them to hold on bringing out the salad until everyone received their main dish.My lobster tempura was really meh.  Like, really meh.  It reminded me of state fair food, where you find oreos/junk thrown into a batter of disgusting oil.  The portion for the lobster tails definitely looked big, but the oily crust was 75% of the plate.  Not worth the $27 price tag.  I will say that the portion for the steak looked bigger than advertised -- definitely a plus, but not enough to make up for the non-existent service.
Indulge Burgers & More="World's Best Burger?"Not so sure about that... but my first experience at Indulge was ok.I actually was supposed to meet a friend for dinner at Indulge but because of a long story involving her boyfriend's car being broken into and him having to file a police report from her apartment, I ended up calling in our order and taking it to her place 'to-go.'Our order was pretty simple.  My friend ordered the turkey burger without cheese, sour cream on the side.  I ordered a burger salad... 1/3 lb burger cooked medium, with jalapenos, tomatoes, sprouts, dill pickle chips, and sauteed mushrooms... with balsamic dressing on the side.  I also ordered a side of sweet potato chips... I love sweet potato everything!Well, I should've checked the order, because when I opened it up back at her place, I realized they did not include the sour cream or balsamic dressing... the pickle chips were actually pickle slices, and the sweet potato chips were actually sweet potato fries.  Just a bit off...Still edible and pretty tasty, but I hate when a simple order gets screwed up like that.  Anyways, I'm sure I'll give Indulge another shot sometime - probably better to dine in next time... that way, if they forget anything, you can flag down your server until they get it right.  It's a cute place - centrally located on the south west corner of Scottsdale and Shea.For those of you who don't follow me on Twitter (which will, in the not too distant future, probably be mandatory...we must all follow each other...the snake will eat its own tail:), I'm on a  nearly constant quest to find the best burgers!I wander far and wide (generally wider, as opposed to farther:)My search took me the exotic clime's of Near North Scottsdale at Shea Boulevard and Scottsdale Road.I guess, truth be told, it wasn't so much a search this time, as it was convenient to BevMo...The Beautiful Carin and I were restocking some of our bar...they don't sell Bunnahabhain and 21 year old Glenlivet at Costco:)And there it was, Indulge Burgers and More...beckoning through the exhaust haze in the parking lot.This seems to be the "and More" strip mall..."Beverages and More"..."Indulge Burgers and More"..."Pet Market and More"..."Chase Bank and More"...you get the idea:)My question (and I always have one:) is "more what"?My personal preference would be for "more cowbell"...how I miss Blue Oyster Cult! :-)We stashed our little liquid treasures in the trunk (taking extra care not to bruise the scotch:) and walked in.Indulge's strong suit is not atmosphere...it's a nice enough space, nicely decorated, clean and bright, but it's in that little strip mall at Shea and Scottsdale...not a great spot to sit out on the patio and watch the world go by, while you enjoy your burger.And you probably will enjoy your burger...Indulge has some pretty decent burgers:)They have a "set menu" as well as the oh so au courant "build your own burger" menu for your dining pleasure:)Our server was sweet as pie and took the time to explain what was included, what was optional (pretty much everything, as near as I could tell) and how the process works:)We decided to create our own burgers...Angus Beef for me and grilled chicken for Carin.You can add more toppings than a normal bun could possibly hold and make yourself one of those freakish Food Network "Worlds Best Burger" competition kind of things (you know what I mean...Frisbee size patty,  1/2 pound of bacon and gorgonzola, apricots, arugula, avocado, cactus, sprouts, peppers, carrots...well, the list goes on and on and on:)Another words, enough other crap to completely kill the taste of the burger, if that's your aim:)But why would you?These are pretty decent burgers all by themselves...1/3 or 2/3 lbs. of great angus beef (I was born and raised on a cattle ranch and we raised...that's right, black angus cattle...delicious black angus cattle...so I've always had a bias for angus beef:)Cheese, tomatoes, lettuce and pickles are all you really need, and they are fresh and included with your burger:)Add in fries and onion strings and I'm usually a pretty happy camper.Best burger or chicken sandwich in town?...Best Patio?...Best Ambience or Service?No, unfortunately...but better than most and probably deserving of the title "Best Upscale Burger Joint Next to Where I Buy my Booze"That's good enough to make me stop when I'm at the crossroads and restocking the bar:)I was skeptical but the reviews were strong and the Groupon was good so what the heck.  It just seemed like an overly simple concept for a pricey cheeseburger.  I think I was expecting a burger somewhere between a Friday's burger and a Burger King burger.What I got was an awesome burger.  Tender, juicy, quality beef.  I ordered the do it yourself 1/3 pound burger with blue cheese, grilled peppers, grilled onions, grilled pineapple and an apricot chipoltle sauce.  I was hungry and I have to say that I tore up that sumbitch in no time flat.They brought out some freshly made potato chips while we waited.  It did seem like the burger took awhile.  Did I mention it was really good?  The fries are pretty average.  I preferred the onion thins.  Yummy.Service was great and our server somehow started telling us about her recent dinner at Ruth's Chris Steakhouse.  I think the point of the story was that the onion thins were better at Indulge than the onion rings at Ruth's Chris.Well, it was just OK. Large portion? Yes. Friendly service? Yes. Indulgent satisfaction? No. I recently met a friend at Indulge for lunch - armed with a groupon that was burning a hole in my pocket!  While we agreed the restaurant concept was good and the service was friendly and attentive, neither of us was overly impressed with the food.  And food is really what we go to restaurants for, isn't it? Armed with our build-your-own-burger menus and little miniature golf pencils, we filled in bubbles (SAT flashback anyone?) and selected 2/3 lb beef burgers with all of the basic things (cheese, lettuce, tomato, etc.) as well as grilled onions. We also opted for a side of sweet potato fries (the & More part of our meal!). The burgers were impressively large, but unfortunately soggy. The beef was not tantalizing juicy, but greasy. Also, the grilled onions had been placed directly on the bottom bun, so it was wet and mushy making the burger difficult to hold. The fries, served with a side of ranch dressing, were average. In my world, a burger should be constructed a certain way, from bottom to top, so it does not end up squishy and messy (is my Type A showing? Yep!): - bottom bun - meat - cheese - extra items (i.e. grilled onions, mushrooms, bacon, etc.) - lettuce - top bun I am somewhat biased, as I grew up with a father who loved to grill and could make beautiful, beautiful burgers. Indulge, while not bad, was not what I was looking for. So, my quest for that juicy (and structurally sound) burger of my dreams continues.09/08/11Great place for gourmet burgers, but pricey!  I was in the area, returning an item at Bev Mo', when I noticed that the burger place I'd been reading about from so many Yelp friends was right next door.  I had just noticed a Now! Groupon deal that morning where $12 bought $20 worth of food there, so I went in and had a look at the menu and decided that the groupon deal was worth checking out.Looking at the happy hour menu, I see that it's 3:30p-6:30p Sundays (beer /wine) and Mondays (domestic beer/sliders) and 4p-close Ladies' Night Tuesdays and Wednesdays (1/2 off apps and drinks).  I'll have to check HH on a Wednesday soon!After poring over the menu for a few minutes and asking lots of questions (organic and local produce and meats are used whenever possible), I decided to customize a Kobe burger w/ gruyere, mixed greens, sprouts, grilled onions, and pepperoncini, on an oatmeal-topped wheat bun, with an apricot chipotle sauce.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bk4FIHt8ODRBPfqL4Fd2aQ?select=7HkjJq2083qp9TxBduhkTw  I upgraded to sweet potato fries for an extra charge.  Sounds great, right?  And it was!  Loved everything on my plate!!  The bun is from a local bakery and made fresh everyday; the veggies were either locally-sourced or organic; and the beef used here are all-natural (no hormones and not GMO).  The sweet potato fries were perfect!!  And the sauce!!  Very tasty- sour-sweet from the apricots, and very spicy!!  http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=M9rRM6Eo5YbKLKMG5QiIPA&select=x6pvF_xqhv5mseBAvyEV6g  I also tried the Mac 'n cheese, w/ ham (extra fee).  Very, very cheesy, and very, very good!  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bk4FIHt8ODRBPfqL4Fd2aQ?select=R2QAn4cH5v9Is0CtRpTvewDecided to skip on the apps, but what do we have here?  Complimentary homemade parmesan potato chips!  Next time, I'll have to check out one of the "adult" milkshakes and remember to make room for dessert!  :))Can't report on the noise level, since it was pretty sleepy indoors when I stopped in at 345p.  The place looks like it picks up a bit later at night, though... The servers were a bit too cool for my tastes-- warm up the room w/ a few smiles and courtesy, please!03/14/12I had a couple of groupons to use up, so on this visit I decided to try Indulge's chili-and-cheese fries, their chili (to go), and their adult coffee milkshake.  The fries came out fast, and even though they were very greasy (as to be expected), the few crispy bites I had were sufficient while I waited for my to-go burgers to arrive.  (I ended up throwing out 4/5 of the fries entree.)  Some of the burgers I'd ordered were missing some toppings (cheese and other toppings I chose by checking those boxes on the order forms the server hands you to fill out), and of the four burgers I asked to be cooked medium, three were actually either medium-well or well-done.  (The only one cooked to medium was the burger I had tried at the restaurant.)  The best part of my experience here today was the coffee milkshake!  It was made with vanilla ice cream, Adult chocolate milk (you may buy a bottle at Bev Mo or Total Wine, I'm told), coffee, and Kahlua, and it's only $8.   http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bk4FIHt8ODRBPfqL4Fd2aQ?select=PGuZSDEwBBFrORLlSgEz7gI say skip the burgers and apps here and just go for a milkshake!I had the feeling that Indulge (and the staff) do not appreciate their guests that use groupons.  My server was initially helpful with my questions, but when it finally dawned on her that I was using a groupon, the initial warm service turned definitely chilly.  And why not?  She was guaranteed to make around 18-20% tip (around $20 for a pre-tax food value of around $109)!  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bk4FIHt8ODRBPfqL4Fd2aQ?select=9RBD09ksq3s1RfxZVIRvnQhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bk4FIHt8ODRBPfqL4Fd2aQ?select=uKfvo5vvQcd6JzoJPeLpNQ03/16/12I had one more groupon to use, so I met a friend here for dinner, and somewhat reluctantly at that, since I knew the service wasn't going be anything special.  (And I was right!  Even my friend made an observation, "I don't think our server likes me very much."  I told him later it's bec. she knew she was going to make an easy $20...)The deal came with a couple of apps, four burgers, and a bottle of wine, so we placed our order for the burgers, and I chose sweet potato fries (to go), as well as the Mac 'n cheese app, but not before I asked our server (the same one I had two days ago) if I could order the side of mac 'n cheese as an app (it fell within the price specification for the apps included in the groupon deal).  Our server said yes.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bk4FIHt8ODRBPfqL4Fd2aQ?select=ygY8t5CvOJsB_aHFQUyvrg  Turned out, the dish wasn't included in the deal, so I still had to choose another app to take home (the parmesan chips that used to be complimentary, and that which I had mentioned in my first Indulge review).The burgers we had at the restaurant were good, even though mine came out medium-well, instead of medium.  The other two burgers I took to-go were medium-well (I specified medium), but at least these weren't missing any toppings this time.  (Funny how I was reduced to counting my lucky stars on having *some* of the order specifications heeded when ALL should've been guaranteed as per the order sheet filled out...)I won't be returning to Indulge anymore, as I did not appreciate the less-than-above-average guest service and sub-par food given on these two visits.  I don't know why some businesses that participate in these groupon events end up offering less-than-stellar service and products when I know they can do so much better.  The goal is to bring in and develop a larger fan/customer base, so this is when you should shine!  I used to understand why businesses added the gratuity (to keep the servers from being under-tipped), but I usually tip 20% (and even much more if the service was over-and-above what I expected), but to see my hard-earned money greedily taken while my guest and I end up with sub-par service AND products, it makes me sick to further recommend this establishment to others.From four stars to one... I have aunts and a cousin who enjoyed their food here a long time ago, but I won't be taking them, nor anyone else, here again!!My girlfriend does not eat gluten so we decided to try Indulge for lunch as they had a very extensive gluten free menu. I had every intention on buying a carnivore burger, however decided to try a veggie burger instead. If the name of the restaurant has "BURGER" in it, I am assuming a burger of the veggie variety would be fine as well. I even asked the server if it was a good veggie burger or if I should order something else, she said "We have VERY good veggie burgers...." Cough, riiiiight.  Our server was very prompt and friendly and suggested, if we were going to order fries off the gluten free menu, we should do so early as they take longer to prepare, so we ordered them in advance(baked not fried).  She came back to take our actual order and not 3 minutes later brought out the fries before the burgers. Ok, a bit early, fine by me. The fries were soft in many places and burnt in others. I thought there were, "MEH", my girlfriend thought they were gross. A little while later my veggie burger was served! - a shriveled up cow-pie slapped between two buns with leaf of lettuce and onion perched on top. A pickle and some carrot shreds garnished the plate. The server saw my confused expression and said, "Oh we don't put anything on the veggie burger, but if you want some ketchup or mustard?" Seriously? No aioli? No spread? No hummus? or anything to damped down this dried up patty of cardboard?!  I ate half of it, primarily because it kept falling apart (nothing was used as a binder apparently), I had to eat it with a fork, but a spoon would have been better. It was so bad, I would have prefered one of those frozen Bocca or Morning Star veggie patties. For $9 it was such a joke. My girlfriend's gluten free burger was a $12 burger on a salad. She asked for guacamole and asked if she should write it on the "build your own burger" menu pad they give you. The server said, "nope I will remember." Guess who forgot the guac. Her burger looked lackluster and somehow a dill pickle on a salad seemed wrong. Frankly, I'd rather Indulge elsewhere.
Metro Brasserie & Bar=After two visits to Metro Brasserie, I feel like I've experienced enough to write a review... My first visit was for the Yelp Adopt-A-Family UYE, (kudos to Metro for hosting and giving us a sampling of many of your fine French menu items).  We had fun that night... highlights in my eyes were the the Gin Fizz cocktail that Ty L ordered - he allowed many of us to sample it and it was delicious!  (I'm not even a gin drinker).  I also enjoyed the flatbread and fried oysters.  Great wine selection too!After the UYE, a few of us stayed for dinner - while I really enjoyed the vegetable salad, the cod was not amazing (maybe it was the preparation with the leeks that I was not a fan of, but so be it - I know not to order that next time!)  I will say a major standout for all of us was the beignets - OMG!  Served warm with dipping sauce, these are a must order when you visit Metro!I returned for brunch the following Sunday, and let me tell you - brunch is the way to go!  Between Jared and I, we had three menu items.  I went with the egg white omelette (served with mushrooms, spinach, tomato, and gruyere cheese) - I chose grits as my side and they were even better than the grits I remember eating when I lived in the South!  He had steak and eggs and the quiche.  We both cleaned our plates.  Fresh squeezed grapefruit juice and coffee also made appearances at our table.  Both were great, but a tip to Metro - I prefer my grapefruit juice without ice next time!Jason was our server for brunch, Chad was our server for dinner, and GM Bill was friendly and helpful as always...  I like the shirts that the waiters wear - go check 'em out!  I know I'll be returning for brunch again real soon.  Maybe I'll see you there!Hostess: Would you like to sit inside or outside?Me: OUTSIDE! I'm from Chicago!Hostess: In the sun or in the shade?Me: In the SUN! I'm from Chicago!And that's how our lunch began at Metro Brasserie on a warm February day.  You Phoenix yelpers don't know how lucky you are to be able to wear short-sleeves in February!!I'm not really a fan of French food and find it too heavy for lunch, but I can usually find something to eat on any menu.  And that something to eat at Metro Brasserie was the chicken salad sandwich served on a croissant.  Our waiter told me it was one of their more popular sandwiches. Gabi K ordered a chick pea/eggplant sandwich, while the 3rd member of our party went with the turkey/cranberry sandwich.About 20 minutes later the turkey/cranberry sandwich arrived, but there was no sign of our meals for another 15 or so minutes. Our waiter apologized profusely and said he didn't know why it was taking so long.  I was about to eat my arm by now (being on Chicago time it felt like an hour later), but we waited and waited and waited very patiently.Once our food FINALLY arrived I really enjoyed the chicken salad sandwich...especially cause it was very light on the mayo. I hate mayo...ick.  Gabi really liked her sandwich as well, although the turkey/cranberry sandwich went untouched because the 3rd member of our party was not such a fan.  At the end of the meal our waiter offered to bring us complimentary chocolate cake to make up for the wait of our food, but we declined...these hips do not need anymore chocolate cake.  Still, it was a sweet gesture.Overall It was probably more of a 3 star experience, but I"m feeling a bit generous...the Arizona sun will do that to ya!More to come from the 5 other yelpers in my party who had the same experience as I did.  I just wanted to beat them all to the punch.  To sum up what they will say in what I'm sure will be great detail:1. The good-not-great, reasonably priced brunch food was totally betrayed by the most inept service of all time.  2. Now reading a bunch of other reviews here I see this isn't an uncommon story.3.  Most of the drinks we had were good, including bloody maries, but make your own mimosas by buying champagne and a side glass of OJ."Excuse me waiter. What's this fly doing in my soup?" "It appears to be doing the backstroke sir." Yep. This pretty much sums up our service at MB this past Sunday. Forgotten entrees. No ice bucket for the champagne. Drinks took forever, if indeed, they were remembered. Ketchup? Our beniets? Ugh! Formerly the FoodBar (remember that place, with the awful layout and crazy ordering procedure?), MB is a lovely French restaurant in the heart of Oldtown. We sat inside, luckily, as some Gen X Jewel type performer was on the patio "singing" and strumming her guitar. I heard just a few bars and wanted to stab my eye out with a hot fork. Fortunately the hustle and bustle inside perfectly drowned it out! The food was quite good. Not incredible. Beniets were undercooked a bit, but hey, we scarfed them down anyway. My eggs Benedict was fantastic; served with biscuits instead of English muffins. But no potatoes. No salad. No nothing on the side. Not even a garnish. Others seemed pleased with a burger, granola and an all American breakfast. Christine is right however, in that we were there to celebrate a birthday. Too bad much of our energy was used to flag down ANYONE who could help us. I swear I almost asked the lady sitting next to us to refill Rickie's coffee. God that would have been fun! So I can't say oui oui to MB quite yet. And for now I shall just say ta ta!Go! Go Quickly! We went last night for Yelp Easts and EVERYTHING practically is on the Yelps Eats menu. My husband and I both started out with the onion tart, my friend had the escargot and her husband had the pate. The tart was fabulous and huge (perfect size for a light lunch). The escargot were a bit of a disappointment. Nothing bad but not as good as she hoped. The pate appetizer came as two slices rather than just one, a very generous portion. We all tried it and it was good (and it's made in-house). For our entree my friend and I each ordered the scallops, my husband ordered the duck and my friend's husband got the steak frites. The scallops were phenomenal. They came on a bed of house made organic creamed corn. Delicious to the last bite. My husband loved his duck. It was pounded thin and panko crusted and served on a bed of horseradish spaetzle. Granted, he loves anything panko crusted, but he did say the duck was good. I had a bite, but the panko crust turned me off (I dislike anything panko crusted). The steak frites was a huge portion and so delicious and bloody. For dessert we each ordered something different. I had the macaroon, my husband got the blueberry tart, my friend ordered the beignets and her husband ordered the sticky toffee pudding. Everyone thoroughly enjoyed their desserts. Mine (the macaroons) came layered with two different kinds of mousses - dark chocolate and maybe caramel. It got a little too sweet towards the end, but it's dessert. Par for the course. The beignets came a huge pile of them with three sauces (one of them nutella!). I will definitely come back here again and I'd like to try breakfast here too. The food was great and the atmosphere near perfect (they need to ditch the TVs - they really don't belong there). Our next Yelp Eats meal at Digestif has a lot to measure up to now.10/15Popped in for a late lunch constituting of an Alsatian onion tart and a glass of wine.  I stopped by during happy hour, which meant the tart was $7 (orig. $9), and $2 off glasses of wine.  Bartender Jimmy was kind enough to give me samples of two reds and a rose, before I decided on a Riesling, instead.  Enjoyed the generous pour, which was later added to when Jimmy accidently knocked the decanter down when we shook hands :)  The tart came out a little burnt, and the gruyere was replaced with a milder "fromage blanc," but overall, it still made for a very tasty lunch/dinner!  Photos will prove that I ate at least 5.5 slices.  Read my lips: I ATE THE WHOLE THING.Happy hour apps menu include onion soup gratin, country pate, escargots, onion tart, and a frisee salad for about $2 less than standard menu.  $5 IPAs, $3 off wine cocktails (reg. $10), and $2 off glasses of wine.  (I'm sure there are discounts on drafts and bottles, too, but since I'm not a beer-drinker, I didn't make a special note of this.)  I hope more food will be added to the menu.  Sad news: the toffee sticky pudding has been omitted from the current menu, with no hope of it coming back again.  (Strange that, since Jimmy said it was a very popular dessert.)  The crowd this Monday afternoon was very thin (4:00'ish)- a couple of tables outside, and me at the bar.  A man sat at a table behind me waiting for his date, and another man who recently relocated from San Fran sat a couple of seats from me later on.  Looks like a decent wine list.  Another HH special- a complimentary cheese plate ($18 value) accompanies each bottle of wine ordered (prices range from $30 and up)!I had bookmarked this place because I had read a review that said at the happy hour, which runs 3 to 6 p.m. including Saturday and Sunday, "Oysters are only $1 each and all wines by the glass are $2 off, but guests can linger of a complimentary cheese plate if they purchase a full-priced bottle of wine. And this is one of the best, biggest, most elegant cheese plates in the city. I swear I have tried most of them," which I incorrectly attributed to a fellow Yelper but, really, had read in a MetroMix post on AzCentral, so I should not be too surprised that the cheese plate was WEAK and IF I had paid for it I would have been VERY disappointed: 3 slices of smoked gouda, 6 slices of white American and two thin squares of Blue. There was a mound of fruit relish (I'm guessing currants, though our server never did confirm) and a splash of preserve (guessing strawberry, but it had no real purpose any way, except to decorate the plate). The toasted bread that accompanied the cheese plate was good and there were inexpensive options for bottles, which I had not anticipated. That said, the oysters really were only $1 each and though not a connoisseur, I thought they tasted fresh and delicious and that WAS confirmed by my happy hour companions who do consider themselves connoisseurs. So, my point: happy hour is good here. Go for the oysters. Skip the cheese plate. You can do better sampling at the deli counter at Fry's.I slept in today and worked up an appetite doing some shopping and socializing at the Old Town Farmers Market.  It was after 12 noon when I realized I was starving since I hadn't eaten breakfast.  (I realize this may be normal for some, but this is rare for me - I eat breakfast every day!)Jared and I wanted to stay in the area and we finally agreed to head over to Metro.  We had Minnie with us, so we planned on sitting outside.  Unfortunately, despite having a patio, Metro does not allow dogs.  We ended up having Minnie sit right outside the barrier to the patio while we sat at the table right inside the barrier and we took turns going out to keep her company.  Needless to say, this was not the most relaxing brunch, but we were starving and didn't want to head elsewhere!Jared had the oatmeal and I had the egg white omelette with cheese grits and wheat toast.  I'm still a fan of the breakfast/brunch at Metro more than lunch or dinner... The service was alright; not overly friendly... and it must've been Bill's day off because we didn't see him either.  Bummer!Bottom line: Metro is a great spot for breakfast in my opinion... but unfortunately, they are not dog-friendly!
Else's=Else's is always chill and cozy, dark, yummy and badass in a punk mamma full of community love kind of way. It's at its best in the winter right after a big snow. The small corner it sits on is the perfect place to watch the coordinated massive machine ballet of Montreal snow removal. Nice scotch collection and beers on tap, tasty samosas and nachos and other little snacks - you have to order the eats to get the booze so they are not crazy spectacular but they are delicious, unpretentious and cool just like everyone who works and drinks and writes tucked into this friendly local institution.I've been to many bars in my lifetime all over the world and Else's ranks amongst my ultimate top 5.  There are 'fun' bars and there are 'cheap' bars - but for my overall favourites, Else's is part of an elite circle in my rankings.  My criteria:1) Good selection of whisk(e)y and draft beer2) Unpretentious without being collegiate/divey/hipster - I should be equally comfortable going there in shorts and flip-flops or in a suit - it should be cozy and dark with a relaxed vibe.3) Good for all occasions - suitable for any celebration that entails copious consumption of alcohol or drowning your sorrows by the bar by yourself or drinking for a wake3) Friendly, eclectic and interesting regulars and patrons4) Knowledgeable bartender and staff that clearly love their jobs5) No TVs - NONE.  I don't like sports in my bars.  And music should be in the background and never intrude on conversation.6) Classless and appropriate for all (drinking) agesElse's has all this in spades.  And it's definitely a locals bar being off the Ste-Laurent drag and it was one of the few places in Montreal that allowed me to start a tab (seriously Montrealers - paying per round is lame).  Yes, they are officially licensed as a restaurant (check out the history of licensing struggles on the menu) so you may be asked to order some food to drink here.  But there's a $4 vegetarian pizza on the menu... you know what to do.In a word - this place is comfortable.  I walked in timidly at 10PM expecting to grab a quick pint before calling it a night.  I stumbled out at 3AM with an invite to a rock show, hand-rolled cigarettes, toasting to East Vancouver to someone that lived 3 blocks from me and a few solid recommendations on good hip-hop joints in the city and armed with the knowledge of how to fake a (male) orgasm.  This place is that good - slink in for a bit and you'll comfortably lose a few hours here drinking and bullshitting.  It didn't take long to figure out that no patron here works a 9-5 job - "everyone here is either an artist or has a story" as one of the regulars told me.  So yup, I came back for another visit.If I was living in Montreal, you can call me 'Norm' here.  I'm already homesick for this place.I've been here twice and it always seems like my friends are more impressed by Else's than I am. This by no means lessens my affection for this place (There is this cured fish and cucumber salad dish that makes me feel like I got punched in the mouth with a pack full of flavour! Though I do wish the portion size was MUCH bigger...), but my friends always seem to pick the dish that's a decent portion and delicious (Fish&Chips, Calamari). This one friend said the calamari at their place was the BEST calamari he's ever tasted. Quite the praise if you ask me. Nonetheless, if you're in Montreal and you want to bring your friends to a chill and cozy place with great ambiance,  I think Else's would be a great choice. They have quite a selection of drinks and great food. I'm the type of person where if I happen to recommend a restaurant that my friends like, I always feel like I take full responsibility of the meal as though I'm the chef. Therefore, Else's would probably be my best bet for a great recommendation.
J & K Gourmet=Let's face it all food is subjective.  We like what we like.  Everyone's tastebuds are different.  And Chinese food is one of those things that everyone has an opinion about.  Many here on Yelp abhore the "chain" Chinese establishments.  Not just for taste reasons but for other reasons as well.  I prefer the smaller Chinese places over the "chains" but I also feel the chains have their place too.  Having said that we were out on a Saturday and I was feeling like Chinese so I pulled up the handy dandy Yelp app on my phone and found J & K.  We walked in and waited for just a few minutes while a table was cleared. It was a fairly busy Saturday night.  My daughter loves shrimp.  She would eat shrimp for breakfast, lunch and dinner.  She drools at the mere mention of shrimp. We ordered an appitizer of fried shrimp. 6 beautiful, big, butterfly shrimp.  She was in heaven.  As for me, I love to order different dishes and then take the rest home for lunch or dinner for the next few days.  The garlic chicken was yummy!  So tender and lots of flavor.  I had mu shu pork.  It was served already wrapped in the it's wrapper, like little burritos on the plate.  It was probably some of the best mu shu I've had.  I also got some house special fried rice.  Everything was good.  Service was fast and polite.  Our server brought my daughter some extra wonton chips which she loves.  I enjoyed our meal and the leftovers were just as good the next day.  If you're looking for good chinese, tell them I sent you.  Just remember, it is subjective.  :)
Restaurant La Strega Du Village=So unassuming on the outside, this place is adorable on the inside.  We went on a rainy and were promptly seated in the jam-packed dining area.  The dining room is small but well decorated with scenes painted on the walls (pagans? jesters?) and candles everywhere.  Our server was a lovely woman who, like everyone in Montreal, turned her French and English on and off with no issues.  She walked through the menu with us and gave us a delicious bruschetta while we chose our meals.  I went simple and had alfredo with shrimp, boy had manicotti.  Both were amazing.  Admittedly the manicotti was a wee bit better but I was not disappointed with my decision at all.  For dessert I opted for the chocolate rum mousse which was lightly sweet and majorly alcoholic.  There was a biscuit of some sort at the bottom the dish that was pure rum-soaked goodness.  Boy had tiramisu which was yummy too but I was honestly concentrating on getting drunk from mine.  Unlike most of the places we went the check arrived shortly after we finished.  I think that this place is so popular they want to turn the table over quickly.  I liked that as we sat waiting for uncomfortably long times at other places (reviews to follow).  I would say this is the best overall meal we had while in Montreal.  La Strega is affordable, friendly, quick and delicious.  You will not be disappointed spending your time and money here.
Amalfi's Pasta 'n' Pizza=After Bill's gushing review, we were in the mood for Italian and decided to check out Amalfi.Side note: "Amalfi" is apparently the correct name of the place (actually Amalfi Italian Cuisine) - and there is a review for "Amalfi", but this isn't it.  "Amalfi's" was entered when the place was created, and has more reviews (3 to 1, soon to be 4 to 1), so I'm putting this here.  I've asked the powers that be to combine them, and we'll see what happens.Anyway - we were impressed with the service.  It was a Sunday night, so things were pretty slow, but the service was friendly, and one area where other places fall flat (keeping the glasses full) was handled deftly here.  They actually fill your glass and then bring you an extra so you can top yourself off in case they don't get back in time.  Rarely does that happen, however, as many times they filled you up with the end of the second one, and then brought you another one of those.  Very impressive.When it came to the food, you could pick up the aroma from the parking lot - they like garlic and plenty of it.  So if you don't, go elsewhere.  There was garlic in the soup (red pepper and roasted garlic), on the bread (garlic knots), on the pizza (to be fair, I asked for it) and on the chicken (in hefty slices).  They probably have a garden of the stuff.  There was surely garlic in the sauces as well - this is just the garlic you could see.Most everything was tasty, only a couple areas fell down.The salad was a fairly wimpy side salad absolutely coated in dressing.  This wouldn't be so bad, but to get it you have to choose between pasta and a salad with your entree.  And if you want both?  It's an extra charge.  To make matters worse, neither the pasta nor the salad is particularly impressive or worth the charge.  As much as I hate a la carte menus, it would be better to take that off the dinner and sell them a la carte so they could do them better.I'll agree with Bill that the pizza crust is pretty good - a nice, thin crust that holds up well.  Unfortunately the pizza itself was a bit off.  I had a "white" pizza that strangely wasn't white.  They could be avoiding Aryan stereotypes or something, I don't know.  But rather than a bunch of cheese, it was a cheese base (ricotta), with another cheese on top (mozzarella, I think), and then a couple of meats (ham and canadian bacon).  I also swapped out the sun-dried tomatoes for fresh garlic.  Now I don't mind the ingredients, and for what they were, it wasn't bad.  It was just strange that it was a white pizza is all, as I'd never had it before.I also ended up dunking it in some of the leftover marinara from the garlic knots and it was a lot better.  I think that if I had chosen a standard pizza (like pepperoni), I'd have liked it better.  Sometimes the unusual choice can backfire, and here it did.We finished up with a dessert, and I can't recall the name.  It was a couple small scoops of ice cream that had a bit of raspberry in the center, and all of it was coated with chocolate.  Pretty tasty really, and a lovely presentation.What a rad little joint. The neon on the windows facing the "street" got my tummy growling as we walked up. Dunno how long these guys have been here but I felt immediately comfy - reminded me of my favorite pizzeria as a kid, except no Galaga.Prices hovered around the super reasonable range on apps, a little high on pie and entrees. But yeah - great crust. Found myself eating it plain, with the pizza, dipping it in various things, sprinkling parm and hot pepper flakes on a plate and wiping, yeah, let's try it with some of that butter, etc. Bread was perfect, hot hot hot, thin crust and soft interior. Bruschetta simple but good. Salad dressing eh.Margherita pie was really good - an interesting line between a street-style NY slice and something fancier. As in, all the crisp-but-chewiness, salt, and grease, but richer flavors. Pasta dish was equally good - ziti and tomato, garlic, smoked mozz. Really hard to make myself take some home rather than scarf it all, right then. Only complaint - slivered garlic was pickled? Hmm.If I lived anywhere near here, I'd eat here often enough to add some points to my cholesterol count, fo' sho'. As it is, we'll keep it for a special northside treat.
Seasons Buffet=My favorite part of Vegas is the trip home. It has slowly become a tradition to eat here on the way out of Las Vegas. Although our whole group of girls loves this place, I am probably the only one who looks forward to leaving more than anything else for two very delicous words: crab legs.The one thing I have spent my buffet eating trips loving is shrimp and cocktail sauce. Especially when there horseradish standing by. Now although I am still quite enamored with them, I think I have found my buffet soulmate in crab legs. Simply amazing. I am lucky enough to have a Tina Z. in my life who used to work at Red Lobster and has taught me the kung fu art that is extracting crab meat from the shells, but you'll figure it out. Trust me. Hot or cold. With or without fatty butter. I am starving just thinking about them and a little sad that I don't have my next trip out there planned yet. Anyway, for those who don't obsess like me, the rest of the buffet is also excellent. Waffles with strawberry topping or funky french toast covered in crunchy oat things. Pizza with a side of full roasted garlic heads (you read that right, not cloves, heads). Oh and my other weird obsession, bagles with smoked salmon and cream cheese. So good. The dessert bar is also pretty amazing. I fell deeply in love with their coffee flavored flan of some sort. And many flavors of ice cream! Blueberry pie! Man it's a good thing they're located in a different state beacuse I don't have the time to go to as many TKB classes as it would take to burn off these calories.Oooh and the mimosa bar. Not sure if it's an everyday thing, but on Sunday there's a mimosa bar in which you can have champagne and pureed orange, mango, white peach, and a couple of other flavors. By Sunday alcohol is not usually on my list of what I want to drink, but I have started to try a glass here or there.Whenever you can find the time to fit this place into your Vegas trip, make it happen. Oh and you'll only spend ~$20 for a Sunday burnch. So worth it.Oh Boy...I'm taking such a leap by writing a public review on the Silverton Brunch. You know you are my peeps when I let you in on the Silverton. So here we go...here are the reasons why the Seasons Buffet is awesome on a Sunday:1. Hardly a line....everyone is at the strip which is so not the place to be, and look at me and my girls....3 people ahead of us...we are so close to crabs it's not even funny and I'm not just saying that because we are leaving Vegas.2. Large round tables! Yes! I hate having to sit at square tables where you can't hear what is going on at the end and you have to go on a scavenger hunt to find the ketchup. These tables are huge and me and my girls can get to business which involves sharing photos, memories and mimosas.3. CRAB! What the hell happened on the strip? I went to the buffet at the Bellagio for Sunday brunch and there was no crab! Are you joking? Whatev...we are at the Silverton, so pile it on. 4. No rush! The friendly servers at the Silverton want you to sit down and stay awhile. No one pushing you out or frowning when you take obnoxious group photos.5. When you are done eating you are steps away from the BASS PRO SHOP! Hello? Are we out of mace? It is a long trip home....we may need to check out the tents in case we get stuck somewhere....wait...are those stuffed wildlife? Who doesn't love stuffed wildlife? And the Gun selection! Wow! Well, you can definitely spend hours in the Bass Pro Shop that's for sure. Last time we left I ended up with a bottle of water, a pack of red vines and a giant stuffed Jackalope that we fondly named "J-Lope" and yes, she was so big she needed a seat belt. LOVE IT!I've been to Seasons several times and it's OK.  They generally have something that grabs my attention and there's something that wants me to take away a star.  When we ate here Sunday, that stayed as usual.  The grilled vegetables were very good.  I always like their roasted garlic pieces, but this night, the roast beef was cooked until the cow could walk no more.  It was deep, deep brown.  Overcooked completely!The spicy tofu in the Asian section was very good and the deserts rounded out the evening on the plus side.  I had some peach ice cream and a piece of carrot cake.  A nice way to end a meal.The service was very good.  There weren't very many people in the restaurant Sunday night so the servers were stretched to the limit.  I'll come back here and I'll find something quite good again and something that I avoid or isn't quite as good.  The place has lost some of the luster it had when it first opened.So let me start off with a basic fact about me...I am NOT a buffet person!  I will NEVER, EVER  suggest we go to a buffet.  I only go when I am outnumbered or when family is visiting. So take this review as you may.  I went here for the first time this week since I had family staying at the Silverton.  I have eaten at many of the restaurants there and have always been happy, so I was aware of the food quality level and just went with it.  It started off with us in a short line to pay and be seated.  Even though it was a really short line, it took over 25 minutes to get a table.  I'm not sure why, because there were a lot of open tables that I could see and they seemed to be adequately staffed, so I am not sure where the disconnect was.  So that just put me in a bad mood because I was pretty hungry.  Just a warning for y'all, when I get hungry, throw a cracker or something at me because I turn into that girl from the Exorcist when I am starving.  YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.Next up, the food.  I was actually surprised how many sections they had available.  There was a soup and salad bar, pasta bar, pizza, American comfort food, Chinese, Mexican, roasted/grilled meats, and a dessert bar that included freshly made ice cream.  It wasn't a huge buffet, but i found plenty of items that looked and tasted pretty good.  No, it wasn't as big as the World Buffet at the Rio or fancy like the Wynn, but it was ok for what it was.  So yay for that surprise!The service across the board was hit or miss.  Our table server was very nice and on her game.  She did great.  The hostesses were all a bit grumpy.  Some of the chefs behind the food counters were not happy to be there, but the chef at the meat craving station was just adorable.  The chef in the dessert section was happy.  So it was a little all over the place.So Seasons is an average buffet for Vegas quality.  If you are a buffet person and in the area, it is an ok place.Well I've been here several times now for the Polynesian night  and I have to say that the food is good for the price. That being said, I only go when I have the two free buffets  promotion (with the Silverton Rewards Club  Card) and with only two people... so yeah, it's really worth it. A lot of items are hit or miss but overall I can't complain and it has actually gotten better each time I go. There usually  isn't much of a wait and the food is always hot and generally fresh.  If you haven't tried it in a while, wait for the promotion and try it again after all free food is better than.. well okay.. it's free food, deal with it.  For the rest of the review, keep in mind that we brought two teens with us that took our price from free to just over $40 before tip. Also, this review is ONLY for the Polynesian night.Now, for what's good. Their tuna poke seems to occupy a considerable portion of my plate each time. The giant roasted pig freaked the kids out but whatever, they think McDonalds rules the world so they don't count. The roasted pig is very good every time I have it. There was also some salt and pepper pork that seriously made an impression on everyone at the table including the grumpy, texting teens. There were a couple of soups that were really good especially the one over by the sushi that had the clear noodles. I don't remember the name but it looked so nasty that I just had to try it and to my surprise it was actually very good. The Wonton soup was very good as well. The mashed potatoes and bowtie pasta were great. I even had a couple pieces of a spicy tuna roll that didn't offend me as sushi on a buffet can often do.  Also, the peel  and eat shrimp was good but naturally should have been fail proof one would think.  The oysters are usually decent enough except for the fact that they ran out of them by 4:45pm. We arrived at 4:30pm and they open at 4pm and I didn't even get one. Not cool. I stood there and watched as the guy in front of me filled up two plates until there were none left. I was impressed with his lack of consideration for the line of  people behind him and yet jealous at the same time.  The empty space was replaced with clams that had something on them that I wasn't all that impressed with.  The clams were fresh but the topping just ruined it for me, not my thing I guess. Some misses were believe it or not the macaroni and cheese. Bad enough to spit out. Same  goes for the macaroni  salad and popcorn shrimp. Just bad. Like take it off the buffet entirely kinda bad. No really. Now for the prime rib. Usually it is pretty good. This last time was different. It was cooked entirely rare and if anyone wanted it cooked differently it was sliced and put on a grill to be cooked to their liking. As I watched cooked slices being handed off to other customers it looked like nothing more than a bad steak. I opted for mine rare as I generally like it. Unfortunately I couldn't even eat that. I felt really bad having to leave an excellent  cut of meat on my plate. It just felt wrong.Overall, the food (on Polynesian night)was good enough to go back, when it's free (or BOGO), if you don't bring teens, just happen to be in the area and are in general just really hungry enough to not care.You just need to find what you like and stick with that. Unfortunately this isn't the type of buffet where you walk in and love every single item that they have. I give it three stars only because I know that what is good is really good and that comprises more than half of the buffet. As for the rest of the buffet,  it may be a bit blah but a person can only eat so much anyway. I just go back to the good stuff and that works for me. If I had to pay the regular price of $21.99 I probably wouldn't go. That being said, I have no doubt that I will be returning when my next promotion comes in the mail.I came to Seasons buffet at the Silverton Hotel to meet up one of my BFF's and her fiancé for dinner. We stood in line and got a table for 5. They soon came after. I was impressed at how nice this buffet was. Food was actually good. As I mentioned before, I'm not a buffet type of person but I liked what they served. I saw that they had the traditional Hawaiian food such as lau lau, chicken long rice, and pork. Mostly known as lechon to the Filipino community. Yum! The lechon was good and tender. Skin was crunchy. I also had fried rice, cream cheese wontons, and the noodles. Finally a place with noodles which I was craving earlier. The waiter was good about refilling our drinks. The cream cheese wontons were huge and had a good sized amount of cheese. I wish I could have taken more pictures but I got caught up in the food and conversation with my BFF and her fiancé. For dessert, I got the sugar free desserts. Trying to watch my sugars. I got a small sugar free cheesecake and a small sugar free fruit tart. So good. Cheesecake tasted smooth and fresh. They also had the regular desserts such as fudge, red velvet cake and so much more. Wish I could have had more but I was already full. The buffet was pretty pricey. It was $19.99 with the Silverton card and $21.99 without the card. Kids under 4 eat free! That's even great for my daughter. This was definitely worth trying. Highly recommend!
Christopher's and Crush Lounge=I rarely give 5 stars, as I believe it is very difficult to obtain a perfect score through food, beverage, service, ambiance, etc. Christopher's new venture is perfectly Christopher, 5 stars.First off a little background, Christopher is a native. That's right; he's a graduate of Central High School. He studied in France where he honed his craft and to this day draws his technique from. He has owned now three ventures in Phoenix, first his fine dining and bistro location on the northwest corner of 24st and Camelback (later became Eddie's by Eddie Matney, former hair dresser turned chef at Cous-Cous then Eddie's Grill) then after closing he moved to the restaurant row in The Biltmore Fashion Park, 2rd level to open Christopher's Fermier Brasserie & Paola's Wine Bar. Which in reading many reviews here on Yelp was unfortunately misunderstood. It makes me wonder if people understand what French is, it's not their fault though, there aren't many French restaurants in town, most have be closed, including Mary Elaine's at the Phoenician  and John Claude's Petite Cafe. There are a few that still survive Sophie's and Vincent's, but in this town of chains few people venture for French. Now with Christopher's Restaurant/Crush Lounge he has passed on the wine bar and opened a lounge instead. Christopher does enjoy lounges as he is a regular at Merc Bar, but then so is his smoked salmon which is offered on the Merc Bar menu. So a lounge makes sense, I'm a believer in a chef should open what they are passionate about. The new location has a different feel from his previous; his last venture echoed a French Countryside feel, as did the food. I think that was why many didn't understand it; yes it was French, but ALL FRENCH IS NOT FINE DINNING. I wish more understood that concept, but this is primarily a beer drinking state, not wine or rather more Mc D's not Mary E's! Hence there's a difference between filling your stomach and filling your soul and leaving a restaurant inspired with the feeling that life is wonderful. Christopher's is the latter. The design is contemporary with long lines of brushed stainless, white linen and exposed wooden beams. Kudos to whoever designed it, great job! The tables are dressed with white linen, elegant silver and polished stemware. You can't help but feel that it's 'time to dine' when seated. The walls in the main dining room have many vases of fresh flowers that seem to be replaced whenever necessary, nice touch.  The food at Christopher's is exactly what you'd expect, French, without the super-high-end prices. He's still one of the only chefs in town serving Foie Grass and Duck Confite, both wonderful and worth the trip if a glass of juice (wine) is added! I've been there now on 4 occasions and everything is fantastic, flavorful and prepared professionally. Christopher offers daily specials and I recommend them including; Veal Chop on Wednesdays, Roasted Duck on Thursday, Lamb Shank on Friday and Rabbit on Saturday. But don't stop at your entree, get the cheese course for dessert or for something sweet, the Chocolate Tower is one of the best desserts in town, hands down, no question.  Service is another point were Christopher sets himself apart. It doesn't get any better than this. Again it's NOT fine dining, so you can't compare it to fine dining restaurants (but then again there's only one left in the valley - Different Point Of View).  The servers know the food; they can describe anything on the menu and recite the specials as if their job depends on it (if you know Christopher it probably is).  Food is coursed correctly with a few minutes in between, as well as wine service is as professional as it gets. The bread service is as always, French breads with a super rich, euro butter, perfect for lapping up to sauce or vinaigrette remains on your plate.Needless to say, Christopher does it right, in my opinion, or is it just my opinion? Many of the valley's most celebrated chefs eat at Christopher's, he's know in many circles as the "chef's chef". But don't take my word for it, ask the chef at your favorite restaurant, who their favorite chefs are in town, and favorite restaurants, most likely Christopher will make the list!Here's the web address:  http://www.christophersaz.com/The website is limited; menu, wine list, press release and pictures of the restaurant...My new favorite happy hour spot! 1/2 priced wine (with excellent options to choose from) and select appetizers from 3-6 p.m. The cheese plate could well be one of the best in the Valley. Four chef selections with crostini and only about $8 at happy hour. The mac and cheese is heavenly, creamy, goodness (and, at only $7, a complete steal!). Service was outstanding. I love sitting at the kitchen bar and watching the attention to detail and rhythm and beauty of the preparations. On my most recent visit, chef de cuisine John Green was in the kitchen. He has a charming personality and seems to enjoy engaging with his public. He had overheard us oohing and ahhing over the gruyere mashed potatoes and generously sneaked us each a spoonful to sample. They were delicious - you could taste booth the butter AND the cheese. He patiently and playfully answered our questions and, on occasion, even challenged us to guess. It was so fun! I can't imagine wanting to sit away from this kitchen!On my list to try: the parmesan encrusted goat cheese and bacon salad, the burgers, lobster bisque and the beautiful steaks!! Quick! Someone, save me a seat!!If this is how the French eat, I have no problem with booking a one way flight there and eating my way through the country. Sorry Rob. Been a great 8 years, promise to write, kthxbai! Christopher's Restaurant has elevated our expectations of fine dining to a level that is dangerously high. We started with cocktails and first courses: the sweetbread and an order of escargot. It was our first time eating either, and I'm definitely a fan of both. I also noticed we seemed to be the only ones eating our bread, and whether that's more we were just eating our way through whatever they brought out or other patrons were carb conscious, I'll never know. For our entrees, Robert order the fillet mignon and I ordered the duck; we ordered a side of gnocchi. Sweet baby Jesus! Were these the most flavorful, succulent and outrageously orgasmic cuts of meat God ever saw fit to be served? I'm thinking so, because chewing was simply a customary task and an excuse to keep the meat in contact with our taste buds that much longer. And the gnocchi, mary, was splendid and deserving of a Nobel Peace Prize. The sheer richness of each course was overwhelming. So much so, that I couldn't finish my duck. But unlike that over-filled feeling one gets when getting stuffed, this was a pleasant sensation of being fulfilled. I can't wait to go back, this time on a Thursday because I want to try their rabbit and see how good it is. In the meantime, I'm going to be studying French and dining etiquette so I at least appear to be refined.Don't tell anyone Christopher. But I have a serious crush on you and your elegant eatery and your fabulous Crush Lounge. This could rival my Scott Baio crush in the 70s. Or my crush on arrugula, beet and goat cheese salad in the 80s. Or even my 90s crush, yep, again, Scott Baio. We were greeted by a lovely host person who gave us the 411 on our dining options. We chose the restaurant kitchen bar which had happy hour prices on food and drink. No sooner had Rickie and I bucked up to the bar did we have our server take our drink order: two iced teas and a large flat water. Soon to follow was some delicious pillowy yet crunchy French bread with a ramekin of soft buttah!While we waited for our food it was most entertaining watching the kitchen staff prepare for what was sure to be a very busy Valentine's weekend. And since I was already with my Valentine, I was most happy. We had a delicious cheese plate with herbed chevre, Manchego, Pecorino Romano and a mild cheese I won't even try to spell. I had a crispy, creamy pizza with goat cheese, roasted garlic and oven dried tomatoes. Very good though I kept thinking of my favorite flat bread delight at St. Francis. Hmmm...Rickie had a burger he enjoyed though the top bun was very doughy and not pleasant to eat. Yam fries were tasty though a dipping sauce would have been fun. All that was only $36!Now. Is it just me but does every new restaurant try to out do the next guy with the jazziest bathroom sinks? Well, I'd have to say, Christopher's takes home the gold. A huge communal sink with a wall in front of you that shoots out water below as you rub your hands over hundreds of little rocks. Enjoyable! And now in the 2000s I have a new crush. And it's a sink. Sorry Scott. OMG...I think I just finished my 400th review! Cheers my yelpitas!I'll post a review of my one happy hour experience there. I intend to go back for more. Again and again.The happy hour runs from 3 to 6, and it was suggested--no--urgently pleaded to me by other regulars that I go just for one dish available half-price during that time: The cheeseburger. It's honest-to-god prime rib ground on premises, served on a ciabatta roll with a selection of yam and potato fries. And yes, it is delicious. It was so delicious  that I want to go back to try the rest of the happy hour menu. It was so fully worth the $7 that I think I would have felt satisfied paying the full $14. I want to work my way through the menu and report back each time.When you enter the hostess politely asks if you came only for drinks (most of which are half-price during HH) or food as well. If it's only drinks you get to sit in the hip-a-riffic wine bar to your left, where stylish Helmut-Newton-looking pictures of fabulous babes with wine wait to stimulate you. If you are going to avail yourself of the food menu you are directed to the Cadillac of lunch counters, where all places are set with fine linen and silverware. You get to watch chefs prepare your meal in front of you. Sound exotic? It's more like Kresge's circa 1974, but the experience of eating brilliant impeccable food from a five-and-dime lunch counter is thrilling in a way.The downside--if there is one--is that there is basically none of the "vibe" that you'd get in a more sporty place. This is a nice, quiet, high-toned place, So maybe "happy hour" is a misnomer. Maybe it's more of a "Maslovian Elevation Hour", where one can sit and reflect that if one has time and means to enjoy a perfectly lovely prime-rib cheeseburger for $7, life isn't so bad after all.So yes, thumbs up.Ok here is the short and not so sweet.This place is not good, over priced, and located in the back of the biltmore for a good reason. Just think reasonably good restaurants ie, zin burger, tru foods, capital grill are all visible in the front of the biltimore. Ok enough said on location.We came after happy hour, apparently the time where this place is semi decent because food and drinks are half off.We ordered drinks that were overpriced and short pours. It is a wannabe higher end wine lounge. ok on to the overpriced and over salted food.Beet salad was decent. Wild mushroom pizza was more salt than pizza. Burger was burnt and truffle fries were ok.The kicker of the evening were when 2 women showed up and decided to sit next to us, when the whole lounge was empty. Anyways, they were loud and winey and complaining how they had been recently dumped (I wonder why?) Then Christopher Gross came outside. My husband and I thought he was making the rounds, which would have been nice, but that was not the case. He sat his right next to the obnoxious girls and fed into their bitching. He even supplied them with champagne.Well I guess if my restaurant was completely empty I would hit on pathetic patrons too. So you guessed it, I will not be returning.The food was decent, however I am writing about their underhanded business practices.I ordered a travelzoo voucher for $69 that included 2 3 course meals. It said "Regularly $140". What we ordered, if had been ordered off the regular menu would have been about $100. However, we were charged tax on the full $140. Second, even though on the voucher it says "PLEASE TIP ON THE FULL VALUE OF THE CHECK." (which implies tip is not included and we get to choose the tip amount) and nowhere mentions automatic gratuity, 18% gratuity (18% of $140, even though we ordered $100 worth of food at the most) was automatically added to our check.Third, even if you had ordered the most expensive options, the highest possible amount it could be worth is $120, not $140. It is mathematically impossible to have the voucher be a $140 value, but that is what they add tax and tip to.Fourth, after we told our waiter we were using a voucher, he seemed less interested in the service level of our table, which i later realized was because he had a guaranteed 18% (of $140) tip.I just noticed today they have another travelzoo deal "$79 - AWARD-WINNING FRENCH DINNER FOR 2 W/WINE, REG. $165", I am posting this so hopefully if anyone is thinking of buying that voucher, they will read this first before they purchase it.A friend was in town recently and wanted a great meal.  Although I had not been there, I suggested Christopher's.  When we arrived we decided to eat at the kitchen bar, but after we ordered out drinks we saw a couple seated outside and decided it was a perfect night for it.  We asked the hostess if we could move and she begrudging agreed.  When we walked outside, she wanted to seat us at the table right next to the door (I think as punishment for this huge imposition) even though there were plenty of other tables available.  We asked to sit at the table farthest from the door to give us some space between the other diner and be in a better position to watch the world go by.  The hostess found this very upsetting and tried to force us to sit next to the door, but after our protestations finally said it would be OK with her if we sat at the other table, but that the server was not going to like it.  She sat us in purgatory as steam escaped from her ears and brought our drinks, but that was the last we saw of any servers.  I did notice the hostess and some servers were having quite a discussion about us and I heard one person say "OK, fine, we will let them finish their drinks".  I wasn't exactly sure what that meant, but after 15-20 minutes of being left in the cold and while we were finishing our drinks, the bread guy came by and we asked him to ask someone to get our check.  A waiter finally showed up with a check and was bewildered to find out we were leaving.  However, my impression was that they had decided not to serve us dinner and were simply waiting for us to get the message.That is a very large space Christopher is paying rent on and that night the restaurant was almost empty.  I would think in the current economic environment his staff would have the good sense to bend over backwards to accommodate their guests, but we were left with the impression that they felt they were doing us a favor by being open.I went to Christopher's for Happy Hour on a Thursday night.  We sat at the counter area by the open kitchen.  The advantage sitting by the kitchen is that you get to sample food from the Chef.  Can't beat that!  They have a good selection of pizzas, flatbreads, wines on their HH menu.  I had the Wild Mushrooms Shallots & Arugula, which normally is $16 but its $8.  You get a full pizza loaded with arugula and mushrooms.  Pizza was on a thin crust and crunchy. The sweet potato fries needed dipping sauce.  It was good, but tasted that it has been sitting in the heat lamp.   The service is sincere and friendly, but can be slow at times.  Christopher's is a very charming place for those looking for an eclectic experience.Came here with the Better Half to celebrate her Birthday.  The restaurant came highly recommended by a friend, and we noticed that they had Foie Gras on the menu (her fave) so we decided to check it out.  We reviewed the menu before we got to the restaurant and decided to order:Roasted Foie Gras Prepared Sous Vide - $110 Smoked Truffle-Infused Filet Mignon - $38For sides - $8 each:Mac n' Cheese au Gratin w/ HamGnocchiPotatoes Au GratinThe server took the order and came back a few minutes later to tell us that they're out of Foie Gras.  We were extremely disappointed and surprised....especially since there were 3 items on the menu that had Foie Gras as the main ingredient and the place wasn't packed.  In an attempt to save the day, the server checked with the kitchen and came back and said there was a small piece of Foie Gras left for the Appetizer but that he could prepare it like the entree.  Since we came all the way down here for the dish, we agreed.While we were waiting for our dinner, our Bread and Water was never refilled and we had to pour our own Wine.  For a restaurant like this, we didn't expect that kind of service.The food arrived...the Filet was decent, but not great.  Not as tender as I usually like it.  The highlight was the Gnocchi.  The Better Half said her Foie Gras tasted a little funny.  She didn't finish her serving.Overall, the experience was sub-par.  The server's attempt to save the day kept us from giving this place 1 Star.Return Factor - 5%Still my favorite happy hour spot. Half priced wines -- a HUGE selection of quality wines from which to choose -- and gourmet quality food. While not on the happy hour menu specifically, the mac n cheese remains a deal. It's cheesy but not gooey. The spiral noodles are perfectly cooked. You'll find plenty of pieces of thinly sliced ham. The flat breads and burgers are standbys. And, these are among the only sweet potato fries I will eat -- generally, I hate sweet potatoes but the seasoning and texture of these fries is doable. ;)Save me a seat at the bar!Cristopher's Restaurant (former  Crush Lounge) is a really high quality and fun place to eat.  I was in town for a conference and several of my colleagues recommended this restaurant.  Glad I went.First, I have to start off this review by saying that the service here is OUTSTANDING.  Or, maybe just our waiter (John or was it David?) was the bombshadiggidy.  He immediately greeted everyone and learned our names (and used it throughout the night).  Super professional and funny service.  Awesome!For appetizers, I had the Foie Gras pate.  It was served with bread and pickled vegetables.  Very traditional French, and very fun to eat!   Grade:  BFor my main meal, I ordered the Foie Gras Prepared Sous Vide.  This dish was well worth the hefty price tag.  It was delicious and well prepared.  Seared foie gras served in it's glory, accompanied by roasted brussel sprouts white and purple cauliflower, and plated with a delicious sauce.  Beautiful presentation.  Quality cuts of foie gras.  Grade:  A-http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/christophers-restaurant-crush-lounge-phoenix?userid=jI5grCzPrcpYgqtNVygWRQ#RpUC0AEb0MeZNoJUwNPutgI'm a fan!Food Grade:  A-Service Grade:  A+Worth the Money Grade:  B+Overall Impression:  A-Another addition to "Pissed at myself for not trying sooner". I think I had't been to Christopher's sooner because of it's location. I'm usually at the Biltmore shopping and spending too much money at the Apple Store. So I usually walk on by to head home play with my new toy(s).So I finally made a conscious effort to go and I was pretty sure upon walking in that I would regret not coming sooner. I had a few drinks at Crush lounge and though tiny, it fit the bill for an actual lounge. So many places call themselves lounges when they're just a bar trying to glorify themselves.Crush is a true lounge-a small scale version of what you might find at a boutique hotel:intimate, dimly lit, good music and private spaces to enjoy a cocktail with someone special. I have to make it an effort to come here for cocktails more often because the vibe here is usually what I'm looking for-mental note made.After drinks we took a seat at the Kitchen Bar, where it was awesome to watch Christopher and his team at working creating culinary works of art. I went on a Monday where I was able to take advantage of one of their specials: grilled tenderloin with au gratin potatoes for $20. SCORE!!!!! It was served sliced up and served with a Cabernet reduction which was delicious. I also got to try some mushroom and arugula pizza which was served on such heavenly crust. Everything was c'est magnifique!I really have to applaud them as well for a top notch wine list. I LOVE South African wine and there are very few places in the U.S. that  feature on their wine list. So as if I wasn't happy enough with my meal and the experience this little extra plus is what earned them five stars in my book.This is a very nice place and I can't wait to bring my family here. I'm sure a lot of folks may overlook this place if they're busy shopping. If nothing else, stop in for lunch and see why you need ot make it back for dinner.We did the worst thing you can ever do to a waiter.  Ever.We showed up 30 minutes before happy hour and some of our group, who shall remain nameless, wanted to wait until happy hour started before anything was ordered.  At first the waiter was visibly upset by this but he soon warmed up to us and never for a moment gave us anything by amazing service.  Perhaps because it was his birthday he was in such a good mood he decided to cut us some underserved slack.I enjoyed a bottle of wine with friends which is something I don't usually enjoy.  I shared some olives and a pizza as well. The pizza was amazing but honestly the olives stole the show.  They are warm and for $5 you get so many it's easily a meal.  I will almost almost assuredly go back for, if nothing else, those olives.
Hurley's Irish Pub=By all means this is the most authentic Irish pub in Montreal. This feeling is even stronger if you end up in the pub in the early afternoon when the music is very low volume and people quietly mind their business over a pint. Two floors with several bars, different sets of tables and some cosy sections, certainly a pub you can find your preferred place to sit and enjoy your Guiness. The black creamy liquid is not a single choice in the pub, endless list of beers on tap, nice variety of whiskeys makes it perfect place to meet friends and enjoy your time together. There is a life music every night, the best is when you end up listening to some of the resident bands who have warmed up so many Christmas parties with some of my best buddies at work. Well Hurley's certainly brings memories if you have been visiting long enough.The five stars for the pub are because of our bar tender yesterday, she did a wonderful demo how to poor slowly Guinness and took care of the fire when for the first time in so many years I finally made it to the most wanted spot in this pub during the winter, the magic fire place.4.5I've never been to Ireland but stories, pictures and reviews have led me to believe that what I experienced at Hurley's is as close to the real things as I can get in North America. Raucous. Bawdy. Loud. Festive. Hurley's is all these things and more. We didn't arrive until late and left after last call. Our waitress was in no rush to kick us out. Her brogue was so lovely to hear. Behind my booth, a quartet of loud, ornery fellows drank like fish, cursed like sailors and collapsed on to each other in a fit of hysterical storytelling that comes with age, years of friendship... and lots of booze.I loved it.I know people come here for food but it wasn't that kind of party. I started with a pint of Kilkenny, transitioned to a Snakebite and ended the evening with a beer cocktail I'd never had before: stout (Guinness) + chambord. I think it's called a Black Fog. A bit sweet and girly but at that time of night after the night I'd had... who cares. I was carousing, telling tales, yelling, and being drunkbelligerent. It was awesome.Imbibing so much beer caused me to wander around looking for a bathroom. As I did so, I had the chance to check out the pub. It had the wood & stone that would fit easily in to a city of age and history. Around every nook and cranny (or, you know, corner) there was another story to discover. I was particularly interested by the outside space, upstairs bar (and closed off areas), brick archways, and brilliant woodwork found in/at the bar/booth area. I'm, typically, not a fan of Americanized Irish pubs because they feel inauthentic and as though they're trying way too hard. This isn't the case at all at Hurley's. From my novice opinion, this is the real deal and it's easy to see why it's such a beloved Montreal institution. I'd gladly come back. I would just come earlier in the evening, eat some food and prepare to stay there all night, getting loud, drinking beer, challenging strangers, and telling stories. Sláinte!
Wildflower Bread Company=Whenever I am running around in the Deer Valley area, I try to stop in to this location. They seem to be a little less crowded (for the most part) than their other locations and I've never had an issue with slow table bus-sing, etc.The most appealing part of this chain is that their food is consistent and reasonably priced. Personal favorites for breakfast are either of the Fritatta's (Honey-Cured Ham and Brie or Feta and Roasted Vegetable) if I'm feeling the need for something substantial. If I'm feeling a little sinful, I go straight for the Lemon Ricotta Pancakes, sans syrup and slathered in fresh whipped butter and blueberry compote (ask nicely and they'll pony up extra blueberries). Blue teeth be damned, I simply can't get enough of these things - they are light and melt in your mouth with the most amazing flavor. I used to always buy a package of the mix on the way out, so that I could indulge in privacy, but I've only seen the basic mix as of late. : (For lunch or dinner I'm a sucker for the Roast Beef and Gorgonzola Sandwich (perfectly rare Roast Beast topped with fresh greens, roasted red peppers, and just the right amount of cheese) or the Wildflower Two, which allows you to select any two from their daily soups, half sandwich, or salads.If you don't have time for a meal, stop in and grab a loaf of yummy bread. My personal favorites are the Nine Grain and the Honey Wheat-berry. Or have some real fun and buy one of their mother truck-in HUGE soft pretzels. These things are so big, you could hook each side loop on to your ears and wear them as a mask... hey maybe I'm seeing a new super hero being born... pretzel man!Any way you slice it, you should be able to find something to tempt your palette, so grab your table card, fill up your drink, enjoy whatever local artist they have performing, and delight in the world of carbs!Wildflower you fickled little minx.  Well you certainly have made some great little dishes lately and not  too  shabby on service.  Thanks for the delish salad, cute little potato soup in a bread bowl and your meatball sandwiches look back to the old days.. Well looks like you are back in the family rotation  welcome back we have missed you.When this place first opened, I was working for a company nearby and would frequent this establishment often because it reminded me of Northern CA. It had good bread, interesting combinations and at the time, a non-chain quality ingredient type restaurant. I introduced many to this place including my Mother and co-workers galore. When I was in AZ in January, I had a breakfast date planned with a girlfriend from high school. It is amazing at what connections Facebook has brought back into my life and this is one of the great ones. I suggested to meet here because it was easy enough to hop on the 101 from Sun City and easy enough for her to hop on I-17 from where she lives. I arrived a little early and waited in the car right in front of the restaurant. I  was thrilled to see how busy it was and all the people drinking coffee and eating outside with their dogs. As I was getting out of the car, I noticed a particular stunning dog and talked to him first then looked at the owner of the pooch. Wouldn't you know it, but it was on of my old bosses (a big boss at that) whom I hadn't seen in maybe 12 years. Small world indeed!Lara walked up and we went inside. I had to keep myself from drooling at all of the baked offerings and almost ordered my old favorite lunch instead of breakfast. After going back and forth a little (this is an order at the counter type of place) I opted for the lemon ricotta pancakes and a couple of over easy eggs on the side. Lara ordered the banana nut pancakes with scrambled eggs and we both had iced tea. The bill was something less than $20 and we easily found a booth, hankered down and sipped on delicious tea while we waited for our food.The food was great-eggs perfectly done, pancakes delicious albeit a little more dense than I am used to with ricotta cakes, but really good. We took up the booth for what seemed like hours (it was really only about 1 1/2) and chatted away. Was the breakfast 5 stars, no, probably more like a solid 3.75 but for all they offer, for the memories, the company and the iced tea alone, it is a 5 all the way.The Wildflower seed was planted before I even visited this place.  My wife brought on of their Morning Glory muffins home for me.  Yum.  That got me in the door.  Had to have another Morning Glory muffin.  So when I tried them I also had a small breakfast of eggs and ham which was pretty tasty and reasonable.  And of course I left with another Morning Glory muffin.  I only ate half at a time though.  I'm sure a Morning Glory whole would be pretty fulfilling.Wildflower is growing on me...Adding another free wifi place to my list doesn't hurt either.I am so so sad that they took away my very favorite sandwich....The Cheddar Braised Beef. It was the best sandwich there. Savory Beef, Mashed Potatoes, cheese, and Au Jus dip. Now its gone :(The Wildflower Bread Company has a pretty dominant presence in Arizona with all of the various locations. The closest location to me is the one in Tempe.I love the Tempe location. I especially love the connection to Changing Hands book store. It's so fun to check out the books and then to sit with a yummy bread bowl of potato soup and admire your new book purchases.The menu is pretty great! They serve breakfast until:10:30am week days/2pm on weekendsBreakfast:FrittatasBreakfast SandwichesOatmealFruitsBagelsSignature Pancakes(my favorite are the lemon ricotta)(see pics)Lunch/Dinner:Soups served in the sourdough bread "boule"(my favorite is the potato soup)Specialty SandwichesSaladsPastasMost every item is under $10.

Tilted Kilt Pub & Eatery=I like tilted kilt.The food is always just okThe drinks are usually good. The servers are usually good. I like the kilt attire. We had some apps:nachos, the fixins are ok, chips got soggywings, good but nothing greatsausage bites, good but you only can eat 1 or 2cheese sticks, meh they are thererings, looked okI had a burger and it was better then in the past. It was missing the cheese, lettuce and tom but the meat was good. The meal was free but the prices were ok. 3.5 rounded up for good service and views.
Roi Du Wonton (Le)=Very good taiwanese food and the lady is always very friendly. I love their beef noodles soup. The service might be slow compared to other restaurant but they made almost every dish upon order. Don't go there if you are in rush. I also loved their home cookies. The price is more than reasonable.
Jane Bond Cafe=I admit their food is great, and it's a cool place to hang out. However, maybe this is due to some of the recent fame and attention that they've received but their attitude towards customers have changed! My friend and I went in, hoping to enjoy their yummy food, but once we stepped in, no one greeted us. And about 2-3 minutes of awkwardly standing around in this tiny restaurant, a man came to us and said: "You're probably not going to be able to eat here, but for how many?" we replied "For two please" then we got the rudest reply I've ever heard, "Ehhh- Not gonna happen! Sorry"In a very demeaning tone. Anyways, I really do hope their service improves. There is nothing cool about being pretentious to customers.
Tossed=Yay - I see I'm the first to review the first Arizona franchise of "the leader of the salad revolution." I'd heard of Tossed before (maybe because it was voted "NYC's best salad" by New York Magazine.) Or, maybe because my friend opened a similar concept called Dressed in Atlanta... either way, I'm the kind of girl that loves a big salad for lunch, and I'm psyched to have a place like tossed here in Arizona...As of today, October 10, Tossed has been open just over a week. So I know I can't be too tough on them... when we went a few days ago, they were still getting used to being open. Even so, it was a positive experience.  The space itself is pretty large for a salad restaurant.  I think it used to be an Arizona Bread Company - I hope it does well at this location as I'd love for it to stay!I was with my brother; I asked if he'd join me for lunch at tossed since I really wanted to try it.  We walked in and figured out to go to the side that was to order in (as the other side was for catering and take out orders) - it was kind of confusing, but we later learned (from Gazwan Paulus, the Area Developer) that bigger signs are on their way.Since I'd picked up one of the tossed menus before we went, we both were somewhat familiar with it, but it still took me a few minutes at the register to design my own salad from their huge list of ingredients.  Zack chose from the list of "specialty salads and creative interpretations of familiar favorites" and ordered the Southwest Blackened Chicken Salad.  I finally chose my unique combo of greens, chick peas, chopped tomato, avocado, turkey, and maybe celery.  I also suggested to Zack that we order one of their whole wheat crepes (that are made fresh in the store to create crepe wrap sandwiches) to share.  After we ordered and payed, we were given a # to bring to the table - I do like the fast casual concept.  However, it was not until after we ordered that we were able to actually see all of the ingredients in front of us - I may have chose differently after seeing everything laid out in front of me...Regardless, it was only a matter of minutes before  our beautiful salads were delivered to us.  Presentation was beautiful, service was friendly, and best of all, our salads were delicious!  I'd taken the suggestion from Tori (the girl who took our order) to taste the Strawberry Balsamic Vinaigrette as my dressing and it was delicious - Thanks again, Tori!  We were both pleased with what we ordered; the crepes were a light, chewy, unique texture that we both really enjoyed as well.  Somehow a bite or two of cheese made it into my salad which isn't the end of the world, but I knew I hadn't ordered it- I'll let it go since they are still so new.There are a ton of other salads that I look forward to designing at tossed and I cannot wait to go back for more!  You may want to check it out online before you go as the menu can be a bit overwhelming.  Prices range from $6.95 - $10.95 but can get even more expensive if you like to add a ton of ingredients.  I'd plan on spending about $10 per person on average.  Not so bad... oh, and they also soup, smoothies, and sweet treats including freshly baked cookies, brownies, and fruit - there is something for everyone.As we were leaving, we met the Area Developer I spoke of above and he was really nice... he wanted to make sure we had a good experience and he told us of their plans to build locations of tossed all around the Valley.  I hope they will consider coming to Old Town because that's where I'll be soon!
Ronnie's Cafe=So let me just say upfront that this place redefines kitch! I mean I would be shocked if you could find one square inch on a counter or wall that is not filled with some cutesy cup or sloppy slang. But I adore this place. It's small and there is almost always a bit of a wait, but the staff hustles and they are incredibly friendly. The menu is surprisingly large and creative for a family run, diner style breakfast and lunch place. They offer the obvious choices you would expect of this fare, but then they toss in a little something to juice it up. They have a standing Steak and Eggs special for $5.95 that I have never sampled but I've seen one hell of a lot of them move through that kitchen! They also have a fairly decent all you can eat Fish deal from 11:00 to close. My personal favorites would have to be either... wait for it... "The Julie Plate" (yes it is actually called that) or the Breakfast Burrito (which bulges with ham, sausage, bacon, cheese, chiles, and country potatoes). But try one of their daily specials, like German Pancakes, and you may be hard pressed to go back to the regular menu. One word of caution is that the servings here are HUGE. I can literally make three meals out of the BB and still have a bite or two to share with my dogs. Ronnie's opens at 6:00 or 6:30 a.m. (don't know which, because I'm not awake at that time of day) and closes at 2:00 p.m. It is not pretentious. It is the kind of place that is comfortable, clean, and serves a steady stream of loyal customers which are greeted by name along with hugs and smiles. Prices are reasonable if you consider the amount of food you receive, and the consistent quality / selection far exceeds that of the most popular chains. If you are looking for trend, go somewhere else... it will just make my table free up a little sooner. ; )Stopped in here Saturday  morning after some friends suggested it and, of course, I had Yelped it.  Julie wasn't sure when they opened (6AM) so I got there about 6:45 and the place was already about 1/3 full.  The waitress, who appeared to be old enough to be my mother, made sure I knew about the senior menu on the back cover.The service was pretty good.  They initially forgot me as I had been seated in the front corner but after that I was checked on on a regular basis.  I am pretty sure all 3 of the waitresses were seniors and they put a lot of younger servers to shame as they bustled around taking care of their and each others customers.  Definite teamwork in play.  Many of the customers appeared to be regulars as they chatted with the waitresses and folks at other tables.I may have ordered the wrong thing.  I had the Sh-- on a shingle with 2 eggs on the side and a large glass of orange juice.  It consisted of their standard white gravy with some shreds of corned beef on top.  The basic gravy had a pepper taste which I have had before in diners but I would have assumed the dish would be made with chipped beef.  Probably not ordered consistently enough to make it worth while.  Even after eating my eggs the gravy was scalding hot and I was surprised it had not separated or filmed over, which would have been my luck doing it at home.  Total bill w/tax $9.51, and I was full.Overall the place had a good vibe to it.  It opens early enough I want to stop in and try some of the breakfast specials that are only available on weekdays.Ronnies is a good place to have a nice breakfast or a decent lunch. The staff is good, they keep your drinks full and will help you in any way possible. We went for lunch. I had a pastrami sandwich and it was good but not great. There was nothing that made it stand out and say "Here I am, I am the best Pastrami you have ever had" While I am glad the food does not talk to me I was hoping for a little more. LOL If I were a huge breakfast fan, I would try this again. Otherwise, it will be in the distant rotation if I am ever stuck and can't find a new place to go.WARNING fellow Yelpers! The 4 star rating is very deceptive. If you have ever read any of my previous reviews you know I don't pull any punches. I tell it just the way it is. They served me a rotten smelly piece of yellowing NY strip steak with my breakfast. Had it removed and replaced with rotten smelly sausage links and patties. The gravy for the biscuits had the same stench as the rotten meat. I think they used the juice from the putrid meat to flavor the gravy. The odor was so bad it was triggering our gag reflexes continuously! Absolutely disgusting and ruined our appetite completely. Hoping to salvage some of the food, I scraped my remaining food onto the toast plate so it would not be contaminated by the smelly steak juice. It didn't help! My son could not finish his breakfast either! They did remove the steak from the bill but charged for the smelly sausage. Total for this garbage was over $20. We were both wondering why there were numerous full plates of food on various tables but no customers were seated there. I think after one whiff they just up and left. Good for them...saved a trip to the ER! The busser would quickly scoop them up as they left. After we gave the busser our unfinished plates of garbage you could still detect the smell of rotten meat. YUCK! No wonder they are dog friendly...They're probably cadaver dogs! Ha haWe prob won't be able to eat a traditional type breakfast for weeks if not months!
Texas de Brazil=Y'know that feeling where you ate so much that you can only breathe through your  mouth?  Well, that happened to me last night as I gorged and gorged on an endless supply of meat at Texas de Brazil.  And boy, was I paying for it afterwards.  I was drunk...on food.  I was delirious from overeating, my eyes were glossy, and I could barely walk straight.  I had eaten myself to oblivion.After our waiter (Adam) gave us the whole introduction of how it worked here, we helped ourselves to the salad bar.  I was pleasantly surprised with their offerings and loaded up on marinated artichoke hearts, cooked mushrooms, quinoa, au gratin potatoes, marinated garlic gloves, shrimp, their soup of the day (lobster bisque), and all their other good stuff.The Big F was taking a bit too long to turn his little card over to green, so I started without him.  Meanwhile, the sides were soon to arrive.* Garlic Mashed Potatoes - I was too busy enjoying the creaminess of the au gratin potatoes to give much attention to the mashed version.* Sweet Fried Bananas - This is probably what put me over the edge.  It was so sweet and sugary good and I ate a lot of it, and I do mean a lot.  The cinnamon on these bananas just had me wanting more and more.  And I probably did take a bite of the banana in between every bite of meat, I just couldn't help it.  It was that good.  And the Big F was having more than his share too!* Brazilian Cheese Bread - It was good, but I had better.  Just as well since I didn't need that for an additional filler.  The Big F finished off the bread basket on his own!They usually offer around 8-15 kinds of meat in one day, among the meats that I tried: * Cordeiro - Young leg of lamb that is tender and full of flavor.  Definitely a good one!* Costela de Carneiro - My favorite out of the bunch, the lamb chop.  It was one of the first meats I tried and it was the last thing I ate.  It was so tender, juicy, and just good.* Signature Garlic Picanha - The crispiness outside edge of the rump cover was so good and tender.  One of our favorites!* Filet Mignon Wrapped in Bacon - It started off tender, but ended up okay in the end.  Stick to the picanha instead!They did have chicken and pork roaming around, but I chose to pass on them this time.  I was too preoccupied with the beef and lamb choices.  I did try a few other meats, but they were less memorable.  There's a couple of dipping sauces for the meats, including the mint one for lamb and something else humming of garlic.  (I got a bit of it on my sleeve and was smelling it the rest of the night!)Service was good and attentive.  They really make an attempt to please you and make sure you leave happy and satisfied.  I don't know how one manages to make it to dessert after you ate so much meat.  The carrot cake alone is a huge three-layer slice!It's definitely the kind of place for hardcore meat lovers ($45/pp) and even vegetarians would do all right if they stuck with the salad bar ($30/pp or so).  Children 6 and under eat free, but 7-12 are half price. RESERVATIONS highly recommended!  You can do that through OpenTable.com too!When you sign up for their eClub, you get a 25% discount (up to a party of 8) if you dine their within the next month!  That's a pretty good deal, especially when celebrating an event.  We'll be back once I recover!4.5 starsA GREAT place for meat lovers =) Meat Heaven! U get ALL you CAN Eat all different types of meats which they bring to you on a stick to eat... =) what more can u ask for?? =)We had some special friends from Seattle roll on through and they wanted some Brazillian BBQ. I had a great experience here on my birthday (see last review) so I felt good about taking them here.  Food was good with lamb still being my favorite. Service is friendly and good, but I think it's hard to top my last experience and still wish I got the guys name because it was inspiring, impeccable service. Sure, it's still pricey and I can't really get behind that often (good thing their eClub gives promotions out fairly often)  but I feel like overall I can count on a satisfying meal here so I'll keep the 5 stars. In the end it's about feeling good at the end of the night with a full belly. Our visitors seemed very happy with it so that to me is always worth a very positive rating. Nothing makes me happier than happy friends.The money to food ratio is very well balanced! I wouldn't normally pay $50 for a buffet, but trust the 5 star rating, it is definitely worth every single dollar! The ambience of the lighting is a bit dim for a buffet, but once the eyes adjust, it's no biggy!I came here on date night with my girlfriend and by the picture of me holding up a lamb chop, you can tell, we were VERY pleased!  The set-up is perfect and service is unique. If you haven't been to a Brazilian-style buffet (Samba inside Mirage), they have servers called "gauchos" that walk around serving the various meats from enormous swords. I recommend you ask your server (not the gauchos) how their little system works, but if you read on, you'll get it from me:Texas de Brazil token of service-- The token that is colored on both sides with either green or red will be your way of controlling the flow of meat to your table. Much like the traffic lights, green means go and red means stop.  So if you're craving for meat, flip that bad boy over to green. If you've had your fill, flip it back to red.  Although in my own experience, they'll still come up to you even if it is red. It may get annoying if you're trying to enjoy your food and you have to tell the gaucho, "No, thank you." with a mouthful.The soup bar is delicious! I enjoyed the Brazilian cheesy bread with the tomato basil soup VERY much! Take your cheesy bread for a dip in the tomato basil and you'll really have something going on! :)  The salad bar has a great selection of cheeses and salads.  The different salads and cold foods are exotic and may not be for most, but hey, if you love food, you'll try anything.  The red meats are VERY tasty and delicious (drooling as I'm imagining the steaks!), the pork is a little dry to me, and the chicken is a bit on the salty side. The only downfall to their almost perfect establishment is that you have to pay for dessert :( Someone should request that dessert be an added feature to the dinner prices!If you haven't yet, sign up on their website for your anniversary date and they give you a BOGO deal on your anniversary! Great + to their already great service and buffet selection!  I will definitely return for another adventure with the gauchos and steaks! YES!Meat heaven.  I wonder how many pounds of meat this place goes through a day?  I've been to this location over 10 times.  First of all there is no reason to EVER pay full price.  Sign up for their email list and they will send you a BOGO coupon for your bday, anniversary, fathers/mothers day (I actually had pictures of my niece stored on my phone in case they asked about our "kids" the first time we used them) and a couple of other days.  Need more coupons?  Use your other email account and set up other bdays!  The coupon doesn't work on Saturday though :(My wife and I were vegetarian for the entire month on January so this was the best place to end it.  Best things on the menu are the filet, lamb chops, any of the sirloins, the flank steak and ummm...more lamb.  Best strategy is to get 4 meats and then flip your thingy to red so at least you can enjoy those pieces while they're hot.  Otherwise you're just barraged by piles and piles of meat and you have no idea what is what. It's a good thing they haven't hired people with Chinese restaurant dim sum experience or this place could get crazy!!!!!!!!Sure it's not the best quality meat but its one of the best places in town to gorge yourself.  Easily one of the top 3 restaurants I would take a friend that has been in prison for 3+ years.How to get a lot of meat inside of youThe Survival Guide of eating at Texas de BrazilBy: Robert S.It's no secret that Brazilian BBQ is expensive, so I decided to put together a survival guide to help you prepare a game plan. Step 1: This place is all you can eat. If you ate a big lunch, take the browns to the Superbowl before you come. Preferably, skip lunch and breakfast before coming here. Step 2: Order water. Ain't no shame in that. Sure Sangria sounds delicious in this hot, dry desert weather, but it's extra and expensive. Step 3: Whoa fatty... go easy on the buffet. It's a good idea to start light and give your stomach a "warm-up". Try to avoid the heavy pastas. Eat some veggies, but make sure you portion control.Step 4: Try not to fill up on the cheesy bread. They're delicious, but filling.Step 5: Identify the filler meats. I did. Avoid the Pork Tenderloin and Beef Ribs. The Pork is a bit bland and the beef ribs are a bit mushy. Stick with the Filet Mignon, Sirloin Steak, Chicken, and Lamp Chops.Step 5a: They have a bacon wrapped Filet Mignon, but I would avoid it. It's greasy and a little salty. I found myself drinking a lot of water. It's still good though, but I prefer the plain filet Mignon.Step 6: Skip dessert. That's extra. Have more fried banana. It's sweet and comes with the meal.Step 7: Don't bring your escort here. Not only does she charge by the hour, but the 60+ dollar dinner is a reimbursable expense. A little about my credentials:I first got into cooking & food when I was in college. After being rejected by numerous girls and getting zero action, I decided it was time for a change. I needed a new makeover to boost my geeky, engineering image. I applied for a cooking position at a Mediterranean-Italian  Restaurant near my home and learned to cook all sorts of pastas and dishes. I never became a professional chef, but I continue to enjoy & love food. 9 years later and 55 lbs heavier, I have a new passion for traveling and trying different foods around the world.Wow! What an improvement!  Service, once the downfall of the restaurant, is now efficient and relaxed.  You are given the time to sit down, look over the drink menu and wine list.  You can enjoy your drink before hitting the excellent salad bar.  You can  have a conversation after you finish your salad without the servers arms reaching in to clear the table the second you put your fork down.  Most amazingly, you can  enjoy a SINGLE cut of meat and a sip of wine without playing the "haha, I flipped the stick to stop one second after the last carver left so back off!) game.Believe it or not, beef taste different from chicken when they are not all piled on top of each other (although the primary flavor is still bacon fat and hickory smoke).Thanks to the slower service, the proteins taste much better.  They do not bleed out on the plate and are much juicer. The only thing I still don't get is the roasted bananas with brown sugar that's offered as a side.  It still taste like a desert to me.The wine selection is excellent.  Prices are very low (near retail).What a difference service makes.  Now, highly recommended.Meat Galore, for real.They have a salad/soup bar in the main room and you basically serve yourself and then there are servers coming around with steaks & chicken of sorts. I am not a big fan of chicken, so I did not bother getting that.  But steaks were all good and amazing. My absolute favorite would be the filet mignon with no bacon. They also serve you fried bananas & mashed potatoes.I loved their fried bananas the best I ever tasted. Mashed potatoes, ehh not so great.Overall, I had a great experience with this place and Im thinking about going back there real soon.TIP: In the salad bar, they have bacon bits and if you love bacon; these are just amazing!The best, the ABSOLUTE BEST in Brazilian BBQ!Being from L.A., I've had my share of great BBBQ places. Fogo de Chao, M Grill, Libra Steakhouse and the non AYCE variety such as Pampas, Bossa Nova, Cafe Brasil, and of course we're known for our plethora of Korean BBQ places too. But the best all you can eat BBQ place I've set foot in is Texas de Brazil. Why you ask? Let's take a step by step journey shall we?First, the place itself is very classy, roomy, very romantically lit (as romantic as plates on plates of red juicy, bloody meat can be anyways), and not too loud. The walls are decorated with lots of artwork, I think it's very well decorated but then again I ain't exactly what youse city folk would consider as "artsy" nor fancy but i do know it's not tacky. Spotting your favorite UFC fighter or Vegas celeb here isn't too uncommon (what's up Wanderlei Silva!). The servers in their gaucho uniforms are very friendly and always super attentive.Secondly, the buffet bar. Wow what selections! Of course you're going to get the usual greens from the salad bar and as always, everything there is very fresh. Asparagus, snow peas, mozzarella, grilled Portobello, olives, baby corn, grilled peppers, etc. Just remember, don't get too excited, it's just frickin' veggies man! The other section offers garlic shrimp, pasta, cheeses, prosciutto, fried plantains (delicious!) and just a lot of other great and satisfying fillers but I sure hope you know better than to fill yourself up with those! One thing you do have to get though is the lobster bisque, man I sip on that the whole night. It's rich, creamy, and just so flavorful. Now for the main event, the MEAT! Picanha, top sirloin, Brazilian sausages, beef ribs, chicken wrapped in bacon, filet mignon, filet mignon wrapped in bacon, flank steak, garlic picanha, lamb chops, leg of lamb, Parmesan chicken, Parmesan pork loin, pork ribs, and pork loin.Oh man, each piece if perfectly seasoned with the right amount of salt and spices. You never feel like you're consuming too much sodium even though that's exactly what you're doing. But you don't get the meat sweats because it's just that perfectly cooked and not at all too oily. My favorite were the pincanha, top sirloin, filet mignon in bacon, and definitely the leg of lamb along with the chops as well. I don't know how many beasts I've consumed at Texas de Brazil but I can assure you, PETA would consider me one of their greatest enemies if they know just how much meat I eat here. The thing that also helps you continually enjoy seconds, thirds, fourths, and so on and so on are the sauces they have for you to dip the meats in. the chimichurri and mint sauces are bomb.com and goes well with pretty much any cut of meat.Lastly, their dessert carts they have rolling around are packed with choices as well. Cheesecake, flan, pies, cakes, and creme brulee galore! Confession though, I honestly didn't try any because I had filled myself up to the throat with meat and lobster bisque and the Brazilian version of Lay's potato chips, the pao de queijo (aka Brazilian cheese bread) because I bet you that you can't have just one. I on the other hand did have just one I think, one basket that is. I love those cheeseballs!Anyway, each person I believe came out to like 50 bucks which is honestly a steal for the quality of meat and everything else at the salad bar that they offer. If you sign up on their website you can get special offers from time to time so might wanna look into that if you're more on the thrifty side. All in all, when in Vegas, screw 90 percent of the buffets on the strip (with the exception of the Bellagio & Wynn ones) and just come on down to Texas de Brazil. Where Texas cattle get the Brazilian treatment (I honestly don't even know where their cattle comes from, I'd just figure I make that connection so it would help me make more sense of the name). Oh wait, just read on their website it's because they combined it with the generous spirit of Texas, close enough. Ok now I'm just talking to myself, but anyways, do yourself a favor and come here if you are a meat lover. If not, stay home you salad eating pansy.So darn glad we tried this place!!!!We ate here for lunch and it was $36.99 per person. They told us that after 3:00 pm the cost for dinner is a but more so I was glad since we were trying it for the first time we got the lunch price.They do offer lesser price for kids.We started with the Salad Bar and I was very impressed with what they had to offer. I never heard of "Grilled Provolone" before and it was too tasty. So many options you wouldn't find at the usual buffet and so so so fresh. They gave us all our own "flip card" that you have turned to Red when you are eating and Green when you are ready for more. They brought us Garlic Filet, Bacon Wrapped Filet, Flank Steak, Bacon Wrapped Chicken, Pork, Lamb, and Sausage.They just keep bringing it to you until you are done. I can't believe for the price you get to keep eating such quality meats.They brought during the meal some "Fried Bananas" to cleanse the palette in between trying the different meats. They also brought some "Garlic Mashed Potatoes" and some delicious little rolls.We all had soda and they came in cute aluminum bottles. I kept 1 for my collection of coke stuff.We didn't eat dessert because we were so stuffed from everything but I am sure it would have been tasty.The inside looks kinda fancy but you don't have to dress up to go here.The service was excellent and we are now hooked and will for sure be back again!I went to Texas de Brazil for my birthday. All the food was high quality especially the meat. There was no wait to be seated at all. They kept the drinks and food coming. Their water was excellent and the meat was well cooked. The only issue I have is that the price was a little high, but it was worth it.Okay...you see the rating.  Here's my review.  Came here to eat last night for one reason...MEAT!!!  With Lent just around the corner, I had only a couple of days before my T-Rex eating days were over for the next 6 weeks.  My date was also excited since there was a 1 1/2 hour wait.  Say What?? She felt that if the wait was that long, the food must be to die for. Well, she was almost right.  I wanted to die after I ate the food. First of all, I've been to just two other Brazilian Steakhouses.  One was in Niagra Falls (can't remember the name because of Mr. Captain Morgan) and the other was Rei De Gado in San Diego.  Both choices were excellent, worth bragging about, and worth the price.  This was my first visit to Texas de Brazil.  I was excited since it's been close to 4 years since my last AYCE meat event.  Not going to describe each item, but I basically got their 2 chicken choices (Parmesan chicken and bacon wrapped chicken breast) and all their red meat selections, including the filet.  I was disappointed because everything was overcooked and salty.  I thought that it may have been the first batch so I got seconds.  Remember, my favorite food is seconds.  Again, dry and salty.  Their Lobster Bisque didn't have pieces of lobster in it. Bisque must mean "Lobster in Spirit" I guess. The meats were so salty, that the salad bar started to look sexy.  And they know it. The Good:-Excellent service:  Pedro is the bestest.  Always asking us how we're doing.  We lied and told him everything was great.  Didn't want to hurt his feelings.  Besides, I was too full of sodium to complain. He still received a good tip because it's not his fault that the food was awful.-Every server was great.  Keep it on green and they are at your table every 3 minutes with food.  Put it on red to put a stop to the madness.  We had it on red most of the night. -The salmon, cheese, and crackers were the highlight.  -Carrot Cake:  Worth the additional $13-The glass of water (Yes, I said glass of water)If I had to rate them just on service alone, they'd get 5 stars easy.  But for $150 for two, salty dry steaks is not my thing.  Where are you Ruth Chris?  I'm coming for you when I'm back in San Diego.  Oops..after Lent that is.This review will probably get lost in the 100s that have preceded it, but I feel like my opinion should be known anyway. That's so Yelpy of me. : )Honestly, it's really not worth it to eat at this restaurant. Great service and pretty good food, but I have had a waaaaay better experience at a churrascaria for way less, I'm talking $26/person for buffet and that restaurant offered snake, alligator, etc. in addition to the normal variety. So, I was not impressed by Texas de Brazil.First of all, their meats weren't very exotic. They had chicken, beef, pork and one lamb variety. They had garlic and bacon-wrapped variations, but that was it. Furthermore, they were "just okay", nothing that made me want to drool.Rice, mashed potatoes, and the bananas were very good side dishes, but you are at this restaurant for the meat, right? My favorite thing was the pão de queijo AKA cheesy, soft, delicious, heavenly bread.We got free cake. It was our anniversary and my man's birthday just a few days before. That was a nice touch, so I did write a raving review about my waitress on the comment card. But, unless I have a coupon, I won't be coming back here.I would skip breakfast and lunch before coming here...and wear loose clothing.With green/red colored discs you have the power to command gauchos with swords of meat to circle your table as they tempt you with different meats...from sausage, to pork, to chicken, to filet oh my! You can also request meats to your specific temperature liking. You come to eat MEAT but the salad bar is irresistible with items such as lobster bisque, asparagus, prosciutto, and the big wheel of imported parmesan cheese that makes you feel like a mouse that's died and gone to cheese heaven...the salad bar is a cruel distraction to the main meat event but worth at least one trip. I make sure to have enough chimichurri for my meat so I don't make multiple trips. This is an insane meatfest but the warm Brazilian cheese bread served at your table is too wonderful to resist...light and chewy balls that I could easily pop all night. Let's face it, you leave your diet and calorie counter at the door when you eat here. The bananas are also a nice treat. Service is always fantastic and be sure to mention if celebrating a special occasion and they will bring out a dessert for the birthday person. Had a papaya something that was very good and different from anything I've had before. Turn your disc over to red once you've had your fill and the gauchos leave you alone.A wonderful dining experience.If I could give more than 5 stars I would.  Texas de Brazil serves heaven on a plate!  If you haven't been to a Brazilian Steakhouse, it's a never ending delivery of meat on swords.   We have been to other Brazilian Steakhouses such as Samba at the Mirage.  But they do not compare to this one at Town Square.Now I try to be a healthier eater with little bits of 'treats' mixed in.  They have a great salad bar that also comes with the meats.  On the salad bar, I found everything to be delicious and delectable.  There, of course, is green salads. What is a salad bar without actually having salads.  BUT WAIT!  You could possibly eat on the salad bar alone with the smoked salmon, spicy shrimp salad, variety of cheeses, cous cous, mushrooms, grilled peppers, LOBSTER BISQUE and more.  Now I put Lobster Bisque in all caps because it made so creamy and full of flavor! I couldn't get enough!My husband completely skipped the salad bar and had all meats.  (Midwest Boy!).  They brought Chicken sprinkled with parmesan,lamb,  filet, filet wrapped in bacon, pork ribs, beef ribs, flank steak, sirloin steak and much more than I just can't remember.  All I know is that it was so good!  The beef ribs especially were my favorite.  The meat was so tender and it melted like butter in your mouth.  If that wasn't enough food for you, they also bring rolls and a side of mashed potatoes for the table.  They also offer some really yummy looking desserts but who has room after all of that food?!  If this review doesn't make you hungry for it, then my review has failed. Just writing about it makes me want to go back again.  If you are in the mood for alot of great food, this should be the place on top of your list! Will I be back again?  You better believe it!So, they offer a free meal here for your birthday if you sign up for their enewsletter. Who am I to say no to free food, so I came here  to take full advantage of the fabulous deal.We came here to celebrate my birthday and dad a great evening. We were seated quickly and surprised by how busy the restaurant was on a Monday evening.Our waitress was very attentive and gave us the whole spiel about where everything f was and how the process works. We started with the salad bar. Pretty good. The soup was nothing special, so steer clear of that. On to the meat. Lots and lots of meat. The good thing about coming in with a coupon was that I didn't feel compelled to overdo it with food. My tummy thanked me for that afterward. The stars of the show are the picanha and lamb chops. The beef ribs and top sirloin were solid too. Service was amazing. Very friendly and attentive. Plantains were replenished regularly. These were probably my favorite part of the meal. All in all, a great meal was had by all and we will definitely be back for future birthdays with coupons in hand!Amazing experience! I've been here a few times, and each time it gets better and better. Start out with the salad bar, but I try to be careful not to fill up on cheese and salad. Standouts for me are the Manchego cheese wheel, smoked provolone, cherry peppers, and of course I love the Caesar salad with fresh grated Parmigiano cheese on top.Now on to the meats... so yummy. I have to admit I was so busy enjoying everything that I failed to make sure I knew exactly what meats I was eating. My absolute favorite selection is the beef ribs. It was by far the most tender meat... seriously so delicious. I couldn't get enough! I also really enjoyed the filet. It's so easy to gorge yourself on everything. My boyfriend really liked the Parmesan crusted chicken, but honestly, I learned something about myself... Once I've eaten a great piece of red meat, I don't see any reason to eat chicken. Next time I need to remember to try the chicken pieces first. There was another great cut of meat that I loved, but I'm not sure what kind. They serve it with three round cuts of meat on the skewer, and when they slice it off it comes out in a sort of circle. It is charred on the outer edge, with a layer of fat followed by the red meat inside. It was so flavorful. I'm usually a little wary of fatty pieces, but this was out of this world. My boyfriend ordered a bloody mary and I got the red sangria. Both of us were really happy with our choice. We also splurged and ordered two desserts because we couldn't agree. He ordered the key lime and I got the bananas fosters pie. I thought mine was absolutely delicious, but of course he thought his was better. Both were really good. Side note: the hostess was not very friendly. She didn't smile or seem to be very welcoming. I just expect to be greeted with a smiling, happy face when I walk into a restaurant. She was all business, not rude, but very serious.Meat lovers paradise!  Leave your diet and concerns about cholesterol at the door because it's gonna be a crazy flavorful ride!My friend's wedding reception was held at the beautiful and swanky Texas de Brazil!  I will admit that I was a bit apprehensive about how a wedding reception at an all-you-can-eat place would be but it was amazing!  After asking for the strongest knock-ya-on-ya-kissah Sangria, we headed out of the intimate and gorgeous banquet room they reserved for the wedding party and out into the salad bar area.They had gourmet cheeses, artisan breads, a wide array of salads, fancy olives, and all these delicious sides to offer and it was hard to pull yourself away but you got to remember that there's a parade of meats coming up and you definitely don't want to miss that!  So after loading up and consuming a fairly modest dish of cheeses and olives, the night became a symphony of skewers upon skewers of deliciously grilled meats.  Oh my.The waiters seemingly danced through the tables and offered succulent and juicy grilled meats onto our dishes and even politely suggested a few off the menu items they'll sneak in for us.  You would think that with a bridal party hogging up their banquet room for hours on end, they might get angry and try to kick us out but no.  Glasses were always filled, boxes of fancy teas were offered to the more modest ladies, and the food just wouldn't stop!  Please stop!  My waistline!  Texas de Brazil is an impressive and trendy restaurant with the most down-to-Earth people --- rare for a Las Vegas eatery!Hot damn! This place is great!I've been to rodizio spots where all you get is meats, unlimited salad... and fries or rice with your meal. Bleh. Here, you have access to a plethora of other foods. Cheeses, salads, soups, sides, sushi; pretty much an entire buffet on its own s'all there. The staff was quite accommodating (we ate A LOT) and even brought out a free dessert for a birthday at the table (the dessert is HUGE too). Obviously the main player here is the meats and they do a great job with them. Some are bacon wrapped, crusted, stuffed or just plain ol beef, but regardless of preparations, they're all tender and filled with flavor. Even the sausage and ribs had an excellent smokey bite. Seriously, come here if you need a food coma. They give you a card so your server knows whether to fill your plate with the latest offering and I think our entire table had it turned to green for a good 90 min straight. Good times. Can't wait for round 2... (in 2015 when I'm not so full anymore). Bonus: Saw Flavor Flav in the houuussseee.I have to give this restaurant 1 star because of a single employee's lack of interest in doing her job. A friend and I went into the restaurant a few days ago to see if they were open for lunch. We saw a young woman working at the podium and asked if they were open. She was on the phone, looked at us, and held up 5 fingers. Not being sure if that meant to wait just a minute, we stood there and waited. After maybe 3 minutes, she showed no intention of helping us or even getting off the phone. She wouldn't even look at us as I made it clear that we were looking for the website to see if they were open. She was on the phone still, now laughing at the conversation. It sounded like a personal call. I asked once again "so you guys aren't open?", and got completely ignored. So we left, not able to dine there since we weren't able to find out from them if or when they'd open. We could smell food cooking from outside, so we assumed they were open. After we left, we took our business to a nearby competing restaurant, and I had probably best steak I've ever had in my life there (Filetto Di Manzo Toscano at Brio Tuscan Grille). I recommend everyone try the steak there. The service is also far superior, as their employees aren't making personal phone calls and ignoring customers.  I would have liked to try Texas de Brazil, but honestly with such a bad first impression, it doesn't seem like it's worth it.This happened on Tuesday, September 9th, around 12:35pm.  I would encourage management to look into who was working the podium at that time and have a talk with her about priorities.I forgot how much I really LOVE this place!We use to go here alot, but it may have been almost two years since I've last been.I'm really glad I revisited!The meats, the saltiness, the variety of sides, the sangria! .. I really don't know what more to ask for! My favorite meat has got to be their house special - Piccanya (?).It's melt in your mouth, tender, fatty goodness! Also, their flank steak was delicious that night! They a variety of different beefs, porks, lambs and chickens always in a rotation. As long as you leave your little card green, they're going to keep coming!As far as their sides they have soup, salads, meats, cheeses, breads, sauces.. and this is really silly, but their Jasmine rice here is soooo AMAZING! Maybe it's just the Filipino in me that really enjoys eating rice and meat BUT I can't get enough of it.. That's really all I eat as far as the sides!Our sangria was mixed well and paired with our meal! I believe it was $25 for a whole pitcher (about 6 glasses) compared to the $10 per glass.Also can't complain about their service .. Attentive and friendly!I can't wait for my next visit!Meat lovers this is the place for you! I look forward to TDB every year for my birthday, even though they no longer give you a free meal on your birthday, because it's damn worth it! A lot of people complain about them not giving the free birthday meal anymore and I was pissed at first too but hey they still send email offers with discounts so it's all good. It's around $50 per person for dinner and a bit cheaper at lunch time. It's worth every penny! If I had my way I'd just start with the meat and skip the salad bar however my wife really looks forward to the salad bar here and I always end up finding some meats and cheeses to grub on. The salad bar has tons of things and everything is fresh. You can just pay around $20 for the salad bar if that's all you want but why the hell come to TDB for just the salad bar? MEAT! The meat is boss here. Service is excellent and the meat is never ending. This last visit I must have had 8 different types of meat! I'm not much of a chicken eater but the bacon wrapped chicken here is so flavorful. I can't get enough of the bacon wrapped filet either. One thing I could stand to not see while I'm enjoying a nice meal is some lady breastfeeding her kid. Let me say that I have no issue when it comes to a mother feeding her child but I'm not paying good money to see it, this kid looked 3 years old, and I saw this ladies bare tatas several times throughout my meal. I'm positive the bathroom would have been more appropriate! I'm also sure when the kid has teeth that can bite you back that you should give the kid a damn cup to drink from! Our server was great and checked on us often. They give you round cards that you flip to red if you don't want anymore meat and you flip to green when you do want more. They have men going around with several types of meats and are great about bringing you the types of meats you like and cooked the way you like. The bar has really good HH deals too. TDB is well worth the money and I'll definitely be back.
Great American Bagel=We had a minimal layover, a mere 25 mins, before we were scheduled to fly to Omaha, Nebraska. Since we were pressed for time, we opted to grab a quick bite at this bagel place (despite it being #nationaldonutday).The prices were typical for your usual airport eatery-- expensive for what you get. For about 7 dollars you got a normal sized bagel sandwich. My family and I got the Las Vegas Special, a breakfast sandwich w/ meat and cheese on top of a plain bagel. It was okay, nothing extremely spectacular. They do not season anything, so unless you prefer bland food-- don't forget to grab some pepper, hot sauce, or salt on the bar after paying. (Which ironically was labelled as being from Burger King!) Customer service was average; nothing horrible, but again, nothing amazing.The location is past the slots, next to the Wentzel Pretzel stand.. Close to where C2 boards.
La's Thai Cuisine=I found a goodie...and it's my new 'go-to' thai place in the new hood... yay!Thanks to Alexander and Jennifer's reviews, I decided to check out La's Thai Cuisine on Saturday night.  I was with Cindy C for the first visit (I actually went back a few nights later to do take-out on my own).  The place is adorable - it's in a shady little shopping center so I was glad we called to confirm the location before attempting to find it.  Soo (that's how she told us she spells her name) was our server - she may also be the owner.  She is sweet as can be.  Beware - everything is on the spicy side... I like it that way; we ordered medium spice and it was a tad much for CIndy.  The fresh rolls are fantastic - the basil stands out and they really do taste fresh!  The special salad (which I ordered during both my visits) comes with ginger dressing and it's a huge serving - just how i like it!  We also had the pad see-ew and mixed veggies with tofu.    With tip out the door, our first dinner was $20 each.  My take out for a big salad and entree (mixed veggies with tofu and I requested they add eggplant) was $16.  Not bad!I can't wait to explore more of what La's Thai has to offer - just don't tell too many people about it; I love these quiet little thai places just how they are!I'm pleasantly surprised that La's is still in business... they are usually empty when I come in.  I've ordered mostly take out from La's over that last few months... and I've been extremely happy with quantity, quality, an cost!My latest order was the mixed veggies, add eggplant, light oil, and medium spice - yum!  I also had one order of the fresh summer rolls with shrimp.  Yum!I love both these dishes because they are tasty and light... I will continue to order from La's again and again... I hope that one day on a future visit, they will be packed.  They deserve it!  Craving thai cuisine?  Head over to La's!
Super Mex Restaurant & Cantina=A neighborhood joint that we pass by all the time.  Coupons for this place come all the time, so we figure we may as well give it a go.The restaurant is split up into two sections - dining in establishment on the left, bar area o the right.  They start you off with tortilla chips, salsa, and a bean dip while they get your drink orders in.The Husband ordered the Mexican Pizza (Large $10.45).  It's your choice of protein with all the standard fixings of Mexican food piled onto a crispy tortilla.  I went for the Combination Plate (3 Items for $9.95), and chose an enchilada, tamale, and soft taco.  For the most part, you can choose your own filling (a few cost extra) and sauce on them.  With it, you get rice and beans.  When the order came out, we thought they were both pretty generous.  Unfortunately for me, the requested low-fat green cilantro rice and low-fat boiled pinto beans were not replacing the red rice and refried beans I had asked for.  The waiter immediately took it back and they fixed the problem.  (Not sure if it was the waiter's fault or the kitchen's fault, but it was done quickly without too much drama.)My enchilada and tamale were both tasty, although the chicken soft taco was a bit dry.  That was probably my least favorite part of the dish.  It made for good leftovers the next day.They also have a Lite Menu, specials for those 60 years and older, gaming promos, and more.Service was fine. It wasn't too busy on a weekday for lunch, so no real problems there.Overall, it's a decent place for lunch when you want some Mexican food.  It helps when you find those BOGO coupons that come along though!
Jenni Pho=I have to admit.  I think I'm in love.  -Her name is JenniPho and she's from Vegas.  -She took good care of me when I was there. -She plays modern rock from the 80's.-She dresses nicely with neutral colors and rattan furnishings.   -She's clean.  She even has a large window so I can see how clean her kitchen is and what she does in it.  -Her broth is excellent in her Pho Dat Biet (combo).  Even her beef balls impressed me!  With wonderful flavor and texture, it's evident that she uses fresh and high quality ingredients.  Too bad she doesn't offer a bigger bowl!-Her eggroll wasn't bad, and her grilled honey chicken was nice and gingery.-Oh, and she only takes cash!I have to see her every time I visit the desert!Just A-Ok Pho in Las Vegas but very good place in the southwest area of Las Vegas (because they don't have anyone around this area)! What I think: DO NOT try Tomato soup pho! I was so disappoint because it smelled seafood not tomato at all and very oily.. this is a big NO NO NO to me (that's the reason why I throw up after ate here) !Also, I'm not very happy with their Spring Roll ( since I'm a big fan of it and after I tried it in many differnt Pho restaurant) !However, I'll come again.... let's see.... hope it will be much better....Hoping this place would be great, I have experienced better! Little did we know, the customer service was very poor, alongside the food! They sold a chicken noodle soup, but it was not in chicken broth! The chicken noodle soup was in BEEF broth! My cousin also ordered her pho, and it tasted like gingerbread was mixed into it. My order of pho was very watered-down! On to the next one for me!
TGI Friday's=Please forgive me Yelp, for I have Chained.  It has been several months since my last descent into this red and white striped den of flair and prefabricated food.  This brazen purveyor of pseudo-good times and siren-like enticements of forbidden Jack Daniels sauce and greasy potato skins.  Again it beckoned to me at a time of weakness, sending upon me of all things...coupons.  Coupons of an almost vibrant nature.  This will not do.I maintain that I am not a regular consumer of red meat, but a couple times a month (no, not those times) I just have a taste for a burger.  I was hungry, the coupon was there on the table with the Sunday paper, colorful and bold.  I yielded.  We went.  We threw ourselves upon the harsh and jagged rocks of corporate commercial enterprise, somehow expecting that this time, yes, certainly this time, a dry and welcoming dock of quality and wholesomeness would appear.  Alas, our hopes were dashed yet again upon the vicious and uncaring granite of the soulless entity even as my wallet was washed aside, cleaned of thirty-odd dollars.I suppose I must come clean with the bitter and thankless details lest the Yelp deign that I am not repentant for my shameless forays into chaining:I had the cheesy bacon cheeseburger because if you only have a big honkin' burger a couple times a month you should do it up.  I did not fully understand the menu (I'm sticking with that story) and was surprised to find that part of the cheesy monstrosity was...fried cheese.  Bacon, cheese, burger and fried cheese.  I take some small solace in the fact that I was unable to best the cheese cheesy beasty and left nearly a third on the table.  I expect that will sate the occasional cheeseburger madness for months to come.  Overall it was an average to less than average burger.My children, for I did not spare the young, had buffalo wings which were reported to be very good, and a kids cheeseburger, which was reported to be...OK.  Nay, even not did I spare my spouse the torment of chaining, for she too was bewitched, and nearly missed being struck down by a pillar of salt.  A very small pillar.  Actually, it was just a salt shaker and it only fell in her lap but that's irrelevant.No, for my wife, fair though she may be, and long possessing of patience, no she too was possessed by the demon burger madness and partook of the very same wicked concoction which nearly bested myself at the very same table.  And hers as well was reported to be...OK.But it was with the youngest that thy peculiarities began, for the milk it was off.  No, not quite spoiled, just...off.  And off with it went the server, to return with nearly the same beverage and yet it was different somehow.  It was chocolate milk, pretty much.  Server, server!  Verily he did beseech unto us; "Is there but more that I may do for you?  Thou hast but to request and it shall be done if it be within thy powers here in this realm of wall mounted chachka's!"  Even did he say to our consternation, "Let me know if there is anything out of the ordinary you need me to take care of."  Looks we did exchange, the kind and forgiving spouse and I, looks that contained so much and could be best summed up with the phrase: "Huh?"So yes, chain we did.
Firebirds Wood Fired Grill=It's a bit disappointing when a restaurant (or a person, or a job, or a movie, for that matter) doesn't live up to its potential. This Firebirds has a lot going for them: decent sized menu, great location in SouthPark, pretty outdoor patio and nice, attentive service. But even with all of these seemingly nice features, the main component - the food - falls short. I enjoyed a lunch on the patio and while it's lovely, there isn't much of a view. Maybe I'm just too short, but all I saw were shrubs in my face. I ordered the fish tacos made with Mahi Mahi, served with roasted almond couscous. Sounded pretty damn tasty, and for $11 I went for it. While the couscous was generous in portion and toasted almond-y flavor, the fish tacos (the entire point of the meal) left a whole lot to be desired. For one, there were two tiny cubes of fish on each taco - I ate much more slaw than fish. But the main issue? The fish was incredibly salty...so salty I was downing my water and could hardly taste the flaky Mahi Mahi underneath. Sad fish. I ate the couscous instead. I think I'll head back to Firebirds for a cocktail at the bar...that seems to be more up my alley!Firebirds was our third choice for lunch after the first two places were closed for the holiday weekend. And I can see why those places were closed, as there was very little going on today. We were one of only three tables occupied the whole time we were eating our late lunch.We opted to skip an appetizer and enjoyed the tasty bread while we waited for lunch to arrive. It didn't take long. My wife had the French Dip which had a nice big bowl of jus for dipping. I had a standard cheeseburger (I think the waiter misheard me as I wanted the blue cheese burger, but it worked out okay). Both came with awesome fries that were perfect. I mean, really, really perfect fries.Nice comfortable restaurant. Enjoyable.
Three Amigos Mexican Restaurant and Cantina=Mi casa es la casa de las enchiladas! YUMMALICIOUS!  After reading Julia S, Chad E and Faith D's thumbs up reviews, I knew I was on my way.  I went with one of my friends and we ordered a plate of four enchiladas and some flank steak thrown on for good measure!  I don't know which one was my favorite, all I know is that I could not cram it down my mouth fast enough, it was delicious. I guess if I had to choose, the mole and the verde were my favorite.   I might want to go back very soon.Any restaurant that I walk in and I am the only honky, hot salsa, fresh jalapenos and servers that barely speak English.  Dude, I'm there.  Oh, wait, also coke in the bottle. Yay!!Disclaimer, some servers speak English, just ours didn't.  Fun visit.Disclaimer Part Deux: The restaurant formally known as La Casa de la Enchilada is now Three Amigos. Same location and same great food!!!Holy guacamole!  I love this restaurant, I have already written a review and proclaimed my love, but I want to spread the good word on this new name page too.I went in last night after an afternoon at the Thirsty Beaver, it was better than normal.  I couldn't believe it, sometimes you love restaurants but it looses it's charm after a couple of visits, not this one.I had never ordered the queso, it had sauteed onions and chorizo. I might have to get that every visit.  It's tiny, the perfect amout for two people.Then BORING, I ordered what I always order, enchiladas verde.  I can't help myself. If you like hot stuff, call me.  no really, make sure you ask for their hot salsa, it taste like pureed hot peppers and avocado blended. It will light you up, just like the Thirsty Beaver.Don't forget to order imported Coke with real sugar.Te amo, Three Amigos. Te amo.I've been putting down a fair share of Mexican food as of late and I was just delighted to finally drop by Three Amigos. If you're looking for a fancy pants Mexican establishment, don't waste your time here. But if you're like me and on occasion you crave delicious, authentic and affordable Mexican fare with a low-key atmosphere, consider this as good as it gets in Charlotte.The daily drink specials are bangin' especially $5 jumbo margaritas on Fridays. But don't worry, every other day they are only $6 each. Prepare yourself that they are delicious. And.huge. And.full.of.alcohol. The service is kind, warm and friendly. There are a handful of servers who speak enough English to effectively jot down your order and if not, well, work on your Espanol, kid.And the food. Delicioso, compadre. I've sampled a few different things here but I really enjoy their guacamole - full of flavor and cilantro. Next time I may ask if they can make it spicy, too! Their tacos (soft corn) are tasty and, again, garnished with a smattering of spice and cilantro. The chicken was succulent and well prepared and I also tried a shredded beef enchilada. Taaaaasty. Portions as a whole are pretty generous and, inevitably, I always leave this place seeking a siesta. I definitely want to come back and try a few other items...perhaps mole next time?!Damn you Three Amigos...I knew it would happen if I saw you, but still I had to try. Replay 1 hour before dinner decision... Wife...let's have Mexican tonight. Me...Eh. Wife...What? Three Amigo's is good and cheap. Me...yeah, but I always overeat at Mexican restaurants Wife...So don't eat everything on your plate Me...I can't help myself, I've tried. Those damn combos kill me. Wife...laughs...you have a problem Me...at least I admit it 1 hour 28 minutes later, I'm full after chips & quac (good guac!) and my chimichanga "combo". So good...so much food...and only $8. Add in a large margarita and bottle of beer and I am full. Yep...did it again. I left some rice and beans for whoever took my plate though. Three Amigo's is a great spot in Plaza that has a few small tables and a wall of booths. Don't be afraid of the so-so strip mall exterior, this place has great cheap food. It's also open until 4am on Friday & Saturday's. Good lord, if I'm there that late I know I won't have any room left from the night's PBR's, but as I know, I'll still stuff my face with good Mexican food. Damn you Three Amigo's! :)Dropped in here on a big ole' Unofficial Yelper Field Trip to conduct a little reconnaissance on the current state of affairs of this little restaurant that could.  After sampling the wares, Three Amigos needs to change its name 'cause it just gained a new friend.Started things off with a trio of salsa/dips and some lightly seasoned tortilla chips.  While even the red salsa was nicely done, the real stars were the tomatillo sauce and especially the green sauce blend of jalapenos and avocados.  This alone sets Amigos apart from the rest of the Mexican fare pact in town.Also got to try the guacamole.  Nice and smooth, with a good blend of flavors, though I'd like it to have a little more kick with the spiciness.  Best part of all, a nice-sized boat of guac clocks in at just $3.75.  That's less than half the price of fancier places that mix it at your table- and as far as I'm concerned, I'll do without the show where the flavors are so good.Entrees all looked good, but I tried out their pure vegan fare, and many props to them for giving this a go.  I had a trio of tostadas with beans, zucchini, and still more veggies.  I now know it is totally possible to eat Mexican without the cheese and sour cream.  Veggie fajitas and enchiladas verdes are also available in both a vegan and a vegetarian variety, though not listed as such on the menu- just ask the staff.Loved the friendly atmosphere here from the waitresses right over to the manager, who checked in on us several times.  Also loved the fact the there is a mix of Latinos and gringos who stop in to dine here- a good sign you have come to the right place for serious eats.By the way, if you are jonesin' for some authentic street food late at night, Three Amigos recently launced a late-night menu from 10 PM till 4 AM on Fridays and Saturdays.  Empanadas, chimi-churris and quipe.  Sounds like it's time for another reconnaissance mission- late-night style!I lived down Central from Three Amigos for about 2 years. Let's just say that I could never have frequented this place enough. It's a perfect shining mexican flagship for the Plaza area. Nestled in a dive-y little strip (thus, parking can be a bit of a problem on busy nights) and quaint/understated. Three Amigos is definitely a go-to for authentic Mexican in Charlotte. The pros outweigh the cons tenfold for this place. The only negatives to report, which I'm pretty sure everyone has experienced, is the service. You might wait for a half hour for your app/entree or MUCH longer with no whisper of timeframe, and its iffy you'll be able to communicate a need for a swift dining experience. This can be a bit annoying for some diners. I'd recommend hitting up Three Amigos when you've got some time to kill. This place gets SLAMMED, too. Kick back and take advantage of the humongous margaritas. The food is to die for. I've never had better queso fundido. Definitely worth the $4 to pair with the fresh salsa and chips. We heartily enjoyed every last drop and even used what was left on our entrees. Bistec a la Mexicano was incredible. So many sautéed veggies and perfectly seasoned steak with rice and all of the standard Mexican accouterment. So much on my plate it was hard to consume all of the goodness in one sitting. My compliments to the chef on this dish. Incredible flavors. Un Chile Relleno will make you melt. The only thing I could say is that I wish it were "Dos" Chile Rellenos. Filled with amazing cheese and avocado. Prices are rather fair for the level of flavor and execution. Love this spot in Plaza. Whenever I crave Mexican, Three Amigos is what I think of first. ¡Ole!OMG, it's no wonder this place is packed during prime hours.  The food is literally the best Mexican I've tried thus far.  I used to think Azteca held the crown but the power has swung full swing into Three Amigos' hands!  Reading the reviews I too had to try the margaritas.....delicious!  I had the enchiladas (came with 3) for my main meal and it was equally divine.Important to know about this place is, yes it's campy inside, yes it's crowded but believe me it's worth it!We have crowned a winner for Nikki's favorite Mexican restaurant in Charlotte. Three Amigos, I hope you have a victory speech prepared.Let's start with the chips and salsa. Can't.stop.eating.these.chips. What are these things laced with? I haven't had the guac here yet. Why? Because I have a massive crush on the cheese dip. Get it with onions.I usually stuff myself full with all of the above, but somehow manage to force down some of my meal. I love the enchiladas. All of the enchiladas. Plates are huge. Huge and delicious.Typically, I just get a water when I'm here. Hello, I need to save room for all the chips. However, on Fridays the big margaritas are on special. Who can say no to a giant margarita?! Yes, it's in a little shopping center on Central. Yes, all the neighboring businesses have bars on the windows. Yes, the sign on the convenience store next door reads "Do Not Enter with Mask or Hoodie." Don't let any of this stop you from visiting Three Amigos. Trust me, you'll thank me.So i have a new friend in town from Texas.  We were in the mood for Mexican, however he said he wanted AUTHENTIC Mexican.  I had never been to Three Amigos but had seen the line out the door many times when I drive by.   After being super disappointed at a couple other competitors my last few visits, i suggested that we try this place.  we arrived at 6....and thankfully not a minute later because the  people started piling in....and there was LOTS OF THEM! .We each had 2 margaritas. ...which set us up right.  Delicious and refreshing and provided a nice buzz.Chips were pretty good and had Seasoning on them.  I like the fact that they serve their salsa in a deep bowl so you don't really run out quickly.  The salsa was not hot at all...however, the flavor was decent. We both got the Mixed Fajitas with Chicken, Steak and shrimp.  Perfectly seasoned, not greasy at all, and a mountain of food.   YUM!We also had a complementary Empanada from the Yelp app.  It was basically deep fried ground  beef and queso.  Had good flavor when it was hot.....but we had so much food at the table, i only ate a couple bites of it.  By the time we left....the restaurant was extremely packed with lots of people crowding the door which is by the bar...and everyone was getting their drink on.  But we never felt rushed to leave.I will definitely go back for dinner here in the future....as it was authentic...and very good!Been in CLT for 13 years .....hate ive not come sooner.GO! Just go.........and make sure that it's on a Friday. Why? Grande sized house Margaritas are $5 each. I always drink two, because they are Fergalicious!!!Be warned.....they are both delicious and potent, which are both good things in my book. After two 'Ritas yesterday, I had a little trouble walking for a second or two. Other random thoughts.....WIBBLY WOBBLYMy initial booth's table was so wobbly that it wasn't possible to eat at that table. I asked to move to an adjacent booth. My waitress complied with no comment, other than a smirk. If that table had been a horse, ala 1950's westerns, "they" would have shot it in the head to put it out of it's misery. MARGARITASecondly, you ARE going to want a second Margarita. Even though they are large, my first one was almost gone before my food arrived. How large you ask? I got in a pretty good arm curl workout drinking those 'Ritas. Curl. Sip. "Ahhhh." Curl. Sip. "Ahhhh." Repeat. Feel the burn!Three Amigos' Margaritas are made with freshly squeezed lime juice, good tequila, triple sec, lime and orange slices, and a ton of salt on the rim. My waitress, who was also serving as the bartender, showed me their placard as having been selected Charlotte's BEST Margarita. The two that I had were the best in recent memory, so I don't dispute their claim. (They are also made QUICKLY!) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/three-amigos-mexican-restaurant-and-cantina-charlotte?select=xVPIVNwRtkg83jlm2N_2aAGUAC ME, BABY!A MUST is ordering their chunky guacamole with pico de gallo, because it is amazing! I always get a small, appetizer size, portion to go along with the chips and salsa. I have never eaten better guac. The appetizer size is plenty for one, but for two or more people you'll need to order a larger sized portion. CHIPS, AND SALSA, AND GUAC.....OH, MY!Oh, speaking of the chips and salsa....the chips come out warm and covered in some type of red spice. They are good.The salsa "appears" to be homemade, and it is filled with bits of onions, tomato, and chiles. I have not had better gratis salsa anywhere else. I usually add a little hot sauce for good measure.TACOSEntree: I ordered the TACOs AL PASTOR today for a change. They were just "okay." Three Amigos scrimps on their taco filling as it is, but there were only one or two pieces of pineapple in both tacos. The flavor was also not as good as their charcoal grilled tasting carne asada tacos, which are very good. I still have not found an entree dish that has blown me away yet, but I'm still hopeful. The carne asada tacos are $7.95, and the tacos al pastor are $8.95. Both are too expensive for the meager portions received compared to other places. To offset that a bit.....the refried beans and yellow rice are wonderful. I cleaned my plate, which I rarely do in a Mexican restaurant. SERVICE? Usually good to excellent.ATMOSPHERE? Loud! The Hispanic music here reminds me of an 80's Latin disco dance party. This place rocks! There is Tele-MUN-DO comedies on the TV, which get funnier and funnier as the Margaritas go sippy sippy. CUANTO CUESTA? Expect to pay $20+ per person, IF you go full tilt boogie and order a little bit of everything, including a couple of drinks. I like to splurge once in awhile, without worrying about prices. I used to go to a good steak house, but more and more lately I find myself craving tacos, great guac, and grande Margarita(s). Maybe I'll see you there next Friday.
Honmachi=The sign caught my eye and I was interested in seeing what this new restaurant had to offer. I was surprised they opened this up in the same shopping center as Swish, another Shabu Shabu restaurant.  The décor was beautiful with nice dark brown tones and orange highlights.  The restaurant has an all you can eat BBQ menu for only $20 or you can order the Yakiniku service which includes a combination of meat and vegetables for the whole table.  They also serve their meet Shabu Shabu style.  So basically, you're cooking at your own table.  I've been to others, but the way they marinated their meat was so tasty.  I recommend the all you can eat menu at $20 as the best value.  They also have a Karaoke bar connected by a hallway that shares bathrooms.  The only problem is, it gets smoky in there.  I wasn't too happy with their ventilation system, hence the 4 stars.
Taiwan Food Express=In my search to the ends of the Valley for hidden gems for great food I've found a pocket of Asian ethnicity in Mesa.Mekong Plaza opened in October 2008 on the southwest corner of Dobson and Main. Formerly an empty Target store, it has been converted into an Asian mall with Mekong Market as the anchor. The plaza houses three Vietnamese restaurants, one Thai and the Taiwanese place, Taiwan Food Express.If you're unfamiliar with Taiwanese food, that would make two of us.While Taiwan Food Express does have a China-merican menu with typical offerings, I'd suggest ordering from the regular menu and the specials menu. This will give you food that seems authentic and interesting.This was probably one of the most exciting dinners I've had in quite some time. Taiwanese cooking has many influences including regional, ethnic and cultural influences. So in order to taste the diversity, we ordered as many dishes as the table could hold and then some.If you're not feeling too brave, feel free to ask for suggestions, the employees here know all the good stuff. Our server, Jessica, made some great suggestions as we pulled a feast together. And at these prices - nothing is more than $10 -- feast away!The Spicy Wontons ($2.50) are filled with tender seasoned ground pork then laid to rest in spicy chili oil. They were so tasty we ended up ordering a second plate.Not being able to resist any sort of food challenge, we tried the Simmered Pig Ear ($2.50). It was funny to watch the look on the faces of each of my dining companions as they raised the wiggly sliced ears to their mouths. These were more of a texture food than a taste food. The ear skin was super tender while the center cartilage was on the crunchy side. Challenge won.Less challenging was the scrumptious Beef Roll ($3.95). A tender pancake rolled around tender sliced beef with a slathering of sweetened soy sauce was slightly oily, but nothing a napkin couldn't fix.The Scallion Pancake ($2.25) had a decent crunch and made a great bread to go along with the upcoming entrees.A less adventurous diner might order the familiar Orange Chicken ($6.50). It's good choice here. The tender batter covered fried chicken was accented by a thick and pungent sauce. The portion size was huge and dwarfs any I've seen elsewhere.A favorite was the House Style Chicken with Fresh Basil ($6.50). This dish was made from pieces of bone-in chicken, then covered with fresh basil. It was plate licking good.Pork Belly with Sour Vegetable ($6.50) sounded good, but the sourness of the vegetables was off-putting. Perhaps it's an acquired taste?The boiled Hi-Nan Chicken Rice ($5.95) was tender, and when dipped into the garlic and ginger sauce it was out of this world.Another textural delight was Stir-Fried Rice Cake with Salted Vegetables ($5.95). Each bite of rice cake resembled a large piece of rice and, while subtle in flavor, had an addictive chewiness.There are so many dishes to try that it will take a few visits to get through the menu, but with prices this low and service this friendly, it's worth a few trips.I've been eating lunch in the Mekong Plaza for a long time now and just found a new kickass place for my hungry taste buds to enjoy.The menu here is very large and they have both Americanized versions as well as some more authentic Taiwanese and Chinese choices.Came here for the first time and ordered the House Style Chicken with Basil and a Beef Roll on the side. They both had some really nice flavors and the large portions were probably more than what was needed before going back to work. ZZZzz!There are several ways to get filled up here. Dim Sum, Soups, Appetizers, Sauteed Dishes and a huge selection of Noodles and Rice specialties.Service was friendly and very quick. There are some photos available to choose from or you can just point at a picture on your phone like yours truly.Can't wait to come back and try out some more of their tasty dishes. They even have some really inexpensive choices for those on a budget. CHOP CHOP!4 STARS
Sygn=I really like Sygn, and I have enjoyed visiting for Friday night drinks and for a quiet Tuesday dinner and cocktail night with fellow Yelpers. It has a convenient location tucked away in the West End (although I find the street a bit dirty and dodgy, although perfectly safe). Based on its location, it has West End cocktail prices but I love the extensive menu of a huge variety of interesting cocktails - some were quite ordinary but others were really delicious, interesting, and beautifully presented. The mocktails were definitely overpriced, which is really a shame, though.As for food, they brough around delicious samples of their pizza the first time I was there. The next time I was back I opted for the steak and cheese burger, which was delicious on a brioche bun. I thought the skinny fries didn't blow me away and could have been much better, but I really did like the burger.I was split between giving Sygn three stars or four, but what made me choose to be generous was that I really like the decor inside. It is really interesting and fun, including their great window decorations with bottles and their ornate ceiling. It's a fun place to go, and I enjoyed being back tonight.
Trattoria Reggiano=My first impression was, "Cute cafe like Italian restaurant subtly inserted in a wall of the Venetian!"You might just walk by this little restaurant if you don't pay attention. Among the many shops and little stores within the Venetian, Trattoria Reggiano may only catch a glimpse of your attention because of their "outdoor patio." It's more just some tables set up nicely outside. Not bad, but I think they do that just to seat more people. Inside the restaurant seats just a few parties because there are about 10 small booths more or less. Their kitchen is tiny! Their ambiance definitely catches the intended theme of an "Italian street side cafe."It's a cute little place if you're craving some Italian food. Great garlic rolls, almost drenched in the oil and seasonings, some might complain. But I personally really liked it. We ordered the margarita pizza, and a pasta dish that I cannot recall the name of. But neither of the dishes were memorable and I really can't see myself ordering anything other than the basic spaghetti or Alfredo the next time I go there. Mainly, I'd be back for their garlic rolls. The food was okay, the service was okay (slightly rude), the ambiance quaint.The lasting impression? "I'll be back for some good ol' spaghetti and garlic rolls. But that's about it."felt like carb-ing up after a fun-filled memorial day weekend!This little restaurant was tucked in behind the lobster me stand. There were about 6-8 small tables outside, and 2-3 booths inside. The ambiance was interesting, it was somewhat an authentic italian feel but was off put by the venetian traffic walking by. The staff was attentive but seemed hastened. Nevertheless they were very sweet. Our noms:Complimentary Bread: Garlic knots - should have been a bit warmer. I'm a seasoning nazi and I think if they added more seasoning to the dough and added lots of garlic it would be delicious. Outside was very buttery. I took these guys home and baked them and added some garlic seasoning which made them bomb!Starter: Fried calamari appetizer - Large portion, lightly breaded and fresh tasting. Not bad but not the best i've tried either. Marinara that came with it was warm but strange. I had to add some more s + p + crushed red. I'm starting to think I just have a salty tongue! Entrees: I can't help but get pasta at every italian restaurant I come across. The man got the spaghetti + filet mignon meatballs. He thought it was OK, but then again we are spoiled by Enoteca Adriano in San Diego's spaghetti and meatballs. (Best i've ever had) For filet mignon meatballs I thought they would be moist and tender, they came out a bit dry. Spaghetti was nothing special. My entree: linguini w/ shrimp in white sauce. This usually comes with clams but I had a bad experience with eating clams far from a coast. I loooved this. It was light and refreshing. Linguini was perfectly al dente. I finished the entire thing and even mopped up the sauce with some garlic knots. A squeeze of lemon and fresh parmesan made it even better! (refer to picture posted) All in all, I would come back for the linguini. 3.5! Ohh the struggle of rounding up or down for a 3.5 star place. I'm gonna have to round down because of the boyf's lackluster spaghetti and meatballs. Sorry guys!Honorable mentions: Olive oil + balsalmic were absolutely delicious. They were obviously imported. Yum. Note: Pasta dishes ranged from $18-28. $18 being the most basic pastas, so I would say it is almost towards $$$.Happy eating! xoVegas is like the Great Glass Elevator from Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.  Push a button, any button, and *whoosh* you're off to some exotic destination. Is it the great pyramid of the Mojave or will it be a poolside oasis in this devastating heat? Well, my mama and I wished to be whisked away to the canals of Venice. *Whoosh* and off we went to Palazzo via the Monorail. Although only 1 stop away from MGM Grand where we stayed, we wanted to avoid the 92º heat at 8PM. Sure we still did some walking, but it was nice and cool amongst the marble laden hallways. After viewing pictures on Yelp of the foods served here, we we're insatiably curious to taste them for ourselves. Our tummies were VERY happy with this choice and so were our wallets! Trattoria Reggiano is a hole in the wall, tucked away within the Grand Canal Shoppes. Although it has a limited number of booths inside, the seating spills out into the hallway, creating a street cafe effect that seems both authentic and quaint. We sere seated immediately and we dove right into the menu. And the garlic balls! We both started with wine, ahhhhve cooooourse. To share, we split the meatballs.Oh, the MEATBALLSSSSS. So tender. So simple. So hot. So meaty. Smothered in the house "gravy" or "marinara" sauce, these went perfectly with the garlic balls served complimentary. The best things in life, come in ball form. They almost always come as a pair too. For our entrees, Mama went for the chicken marsala and I, the carbonara. Mine was so rich, creamy, and the right amount of salty bacon. Although I was extremely full from the meatballs and bread rolls, I don't know how I scarfed this amazing bowl of pasta down, but it was DAMN DELICIOUS. When all parts of a restaurant (ambiance, service, food, timing) come together in serendipitous unity, it's pure bliss. It's also the button I wanna press all the time in the Great Glass Elevator.Before a show at the Palazzo, I came here for dinner.  First impressions were not that good as there was no one at the podium.  A waiter came up to me, didn't say anything, and then turned and left.  Another waiter came over and showed me to a table on their "patio" along the Grand Canal Shops at the Venetian.  The tables are very close together in this area and as has been stated in other reviews, this is a high traffic area.  I tend to like people watching so I didn't mind the traffic.  It would have been nice if I didn't have to pretend not to hear the conversation of the two women at the table an arm's length from me.I was brought a menu and asked about drinks.  Soon a server came with three cheese and garlic rolls and some balsamic and EVOO which he left on the table.  My iced tea was brought and I ordered.  Asking the server what was the smallest appetizer, he suggested the caprese.  I ordered the caprese and the pesto gnocchi.  The caprese was OK.  The tomatoes were hot house tomatoes and not very flavorful and a bit hard.  The burrata was quite good.  The pouch of cheese pulled apart and I could place it on the tomato slices.  My server had done some freshly grated pepper on the caprese and that helped.  The best appetizer would have been simply the cheese with some bread and EVOO and let the tomatoes die on the hothouse floor.The pesto gnocchi was pretty standard.  There wasn't a strong pesto flavor, but the gnocchi were soft and tasty.After dinner, the server brought me a tray of dessert replicas and I chose the tiramisu.  It's done in a manner you don't see very often.  Instead of a cake like dessert, this version is mostly cream with lots of chocolate powder and some pieces of cake and chocolate near the bottom of the cream.  This was the best part of the meal.  The cream was perfect.  My only complaint is the dessert was served in a fluted goblet, but in the manner of drizzling syrups and sauces over dishes for looks, the plate on which the goblet rested was lined with caramel sauce and confectioners' sugar.  Why decorate a plate on which there's no food?  In fact, I got part of my hand on the caramel and I needed to find a washroom after I left to wash it all off.Service was good except for the start.  The place is OK but it's not a place I need to return to for Italian food.  Too many choices in this complex alone.Outstanding Italian food in the Venetian Mall! If you're lucky enough to be in Vegas and at the Venetian, don't skip this very popular spot in the Mall. The atmosphere on the patio has the urban street scene feel with all the mall customers walking by; lot's of hustle and bustle but it's not distracting like having a slot machine ringing in your ear. It was loud, boisterous... but nice! Very cool joint that I can't wait to visit again.WHEN YOU GO- Ask for Sergio and wait if you have to. The guy's worth it! DO NOT skip the Filet Mignon Meatballs. They're as good as they sound. Lobster Ravioli, Chicken Parm and lobster ravioli are winners as well.Very nice spot that is from now on in my regular Las Vegas resto rotation!This restaurant openly discriminates against people with children. If that appeals to you, great, but wait - there's more!  It has terrible service too.We walked up with our three kids when we saw there were at least six tables open.  We were told "there was a reservation" and that we could put our name on the list.  We did and went for a walk, for about 45 minutes.  We walked by again and guess what?  The same tables were open.  I asked again and guess what we were immediately seated, though the hostess seemed unwilling to do so.  What about that list? It was never mentioned.They put us in the back corner.  I saw the same open table in the front patio that had been and still was open when we first asked to be seated.  And when I asked, you guessed it, a "reservation."  The hostess had an extremely unwelcoming attitude. She said that they didn't have a kids' menu and we would have to order off of the adults menu.  Once we sat we were ignored for about 10 minutes.  It was clear that we weren't welcome, so we got up and left. When I walked by an hour later after eating somewhere else, that table was still open.   Let's get one more thing straight - this is no gourmet restaurant - it's in the middle of a mall adjacent to a food court!  There are kids and families everywhere.Yet another business that has no need for paying customers! Don't bother going there!Just no. I don't understand how their ratings can be so high. Walking in for a late dinner we were sat immediately. The waiter took our drink order,food order and tossed them at the table like we were unwanted there or he was having a bad day. I ordered a shrimp scampi and when it arrived it did not looked the way I thought it would. They should change the name to stuff shrimps instead. It seriously taste like something from Olive Garden or Red Lobsters. Overpriced,horrible service and mediocre food. I just don't get it.
Birmingham Bridge Tavern=Walking in here, you expect the music to come to a stop and everyone turns around and stares at you.  You know, one of those dive bars that everybody knows your name, because you're a regular.  But for me, a stranger coming in, I thought it would be awkward.  I'm happy to report, it wasn't at all!It almost seems like paradise!  A cozy little corner bar that has cheap food and a comfortable atmosphere.  We stopped in on a whim and it was a good decision.  It was 50 cent boneless wings and then at 8pm the beers went half off (Thursday night, just so you know:).  The news just kept getting better!  The selection of beers on tap is awesome.  What's even better is that the bartender was super nice and kept getting us samples of beers she thought we'd like.  I'm a total wimp when it comes to ordering spicy food, so I opted for the non spicy side of the menu (it's cool they have the menu listing from mild to hot wings).  I chose the garlic parm and Golden BBQ (honey BBQ).  They were good, a bit small, but not surprising for boneless wings.  I really liked the BBQ sauce, it was sweet and tangy and mixed well with the ranch to dip.The absolute only  thing I didn't like was that they allow smoking in here still.  I had just washed my hair that night too, ugh!  That smoke just sticks to you....yuck!I have a feeling this could become my new "spot."  Who knows, maybe I'll even become a regular...and not look disdainfully at the stranger walking through the door, because I'll know it's worth it!
Rampart Buffet=You will see the same group of old people here every day. I am not exaggerating, they come here EVERY SINGLE DAY. Due to this, the restaurant manager allows them to have an express ticket to the front of the line, and they get their own seating area next to the food so that they don't have to walk far. The elderly regulars I mentioned completely hate when outsiders come into "their" restaurant. I've been here 3 times, and every single time, multiple regulars complained to me that if I(an outsider) didn't come to eat here today, there would be a shorter line and shorter wait time for them.  Last time I was here the group of regulars who were standing behind me at the cashier were loudly complaining about how it was a travesty that they had to stand in a line to pay now that "outsiders" had shown up. Ever since Rampart changed management, they have been sending out free buffet coupons to players club members. Therefore, this buffet has become extremely crowded. Back before they started sending out comps, only the same 20-30 regulars would show up for dinner every night. Now, there are 100s of new people showing up and it makes the regulars really angry. So, expect one of those angry old people to yell at you. The best thing about this place is that they have this really cool coffee-computer thing that instantly makes any kind of coffee you want. You don't have to wait 20 minutes for the server to bring it to you, it's all self-serveThis is Summerlin/NW Vegas so there will be a lot of bitter people fighting and arguing about stupid things. The last time I came I saw this guy whining because the guy in front of him got a bigger slice of prime rib. He kept shouting: "His was bigger than mine! That's not fair!".... It's an AYCE buffet, just ask for another slice. WTF is wrong with these people?
Cafe Deia=Exploring a new restaurant is always of interest.  The menu at Cafe Deia caught our attention, along with a few other specials they were offering.Starting off with their White Sangria ($20 pitcher), I found it to be a bit strong and not sweet enough.  I had to ask for some simple syrup so I could enjoy it morel.  Like Amy S. mentioned, they could really use some real fruit in there.  I like my sangria loaded with fruit and it's mostly lemon slices in there.A pretty large menu to choose from, but we decided to go with tapas all the way.* Serrano Ham and Manchego Cheese "Thinly sliced imported Serrano ham served with Manchego and a French baguette" ($9) - Highly recommended by our waiter, Chris.  Warm baguette arrived with a few slices of cheese and salty ham. Yes, it's good and very rustic.  Reminds me of the kind of food you grab for a picnic when you're overseas.  They give you more bread if you need it too!* Tuna Tartar "Diced ahi tuna mixed in wasabi, soy sauce and Asian chili paste served with avocado and green onions" ($8) - The avocado and tomatoes are served in a crispy shell with the tuna mixture and hard-boiled egg bits on the side.  Good, but needs some assembling if you want to get all the tastes in your mouth at once.* Shrimp Ceviche "Tiger shrimp cooked in lime and lemon juice, mixed with avocado, cucumber, red onions and chili pepper" ($9) - Generous on the shrimp and tasty!  It was good on its own and presented in a nice manner too.* Bacon Wrapped Figs "Fresh figs wrapped in bacon and pan seared" ($7) - My absoluter favorite dish of the evening.  A total flavor explosion in your mouth!  The balsamic vinegar sauce adds a nice acidity and sweetness, and is just delicious!  * Stuffed Mushrooms "Stuffed Chorizo mushrooms, and baked to perfection." ($4) - Yummy little buggers as well, along with the balsamic vinegar sauce drizzled on the bottom.  Good stuff! * Black Mediterranean Mussels in Garlic White Wine Sauce "Sauteed in garlic and white wine" ($9) - Came with bread which is needed to sop up all that wine and garlic sauce laying beneath the mussels.  Yum.* Mallorcan Soup "the only soup you can eat with a fork! pork, vegetables and bread slowly cooked in olive oil and natural juices" ($5) - It's 'interesting' if anything.  More stew-like, and not one of my favorites although the Husband enjoyed it.Dessert menus are delivered in a letter.* Fruit Beignet $3 - Pretty disappointing.  Nothing to rave about.  The batter had hints of all the other savory foods that it was fried with.* Chocolate Banana Crepe ($5) - Highly recommended by our waiter, especially since I wasn't impressed with the beignet.  The crepes were okay, a bit too thick for my liking.  Reminded me of pancakes, which I'm more of a waffle kind of girl.  Simple crepes, folded over, then slices of banana, chocolate sauce, and powdered sugar go on top.  I think the Spanish Creme Brulee ($7) or Chocolate Lave Cake ($7) would have fared better.We did try ordering:* Sausage Platter "Assorted imported Spanish sausages served with a French baguette" ($8) - Our waiter wasn't too fond of this and pushed the Serrano Ham and Manchego Cheese dish on us instead.* Albondigas "Ground beef meatballs served in a spicy tomato sauce" ($5) - Again, we wanted to order this, but was discouraged to do so.  Just as well from reading all the other reviews about this dish.Overall, service was good.  Chris was attentive as well as the other staff that helped along.  The food came out a bit too fast for the two of us, so we had to make room quickly at our table.  The chef came by at one point to check on our meal, which I definitely appreciated that personal touch.  (The Husband also noticed the chef helping out with front room duties too.)  We also saw salads made table side, which is totally unnecessary but a nice presentational effect.They have a lot of promise.  An outdoor eating area with firepit and happy hour specials can definitely pull in the crowds.  We went during their Mardi Gras specials.  The tapas we ordered are perfect for two to three sharing, maybe even four.  They also serve up salads, paellas, burgers, and pizza if you want something more for just yourself too. (Pics posted!)
Grimaldi's Coal Brick-Oven Pizza=We had a taste for some good New York style pizza and heard a Grimaldi's opened recently out east of us at the furthest reaches of the realm...San Tan Village in Gilbert.  I knew from Yelp reviews of other Grimaldi's that we needed to check them out for ourselves as they are reputed to be the real deal.We started with a small mediterranean salad ($7) and a Leinenkugel Sunset Wheat.  I was pleasantly surprised at the size of the small salad.  It was more than enough for the 3 of us to share.  It had fresh, crisp greens and a good amount of yummy feta, olives, red onion slices and ripe tomatoes.  The sunset wheat ale was tasty but wouldn't be my first choice.  For my taste it was too fruity with a hint of clover or something.And then the pizza arrived.  Magnifico!  A thin yet supportive and crunchy crust with a nice tomato sauce and delicious slices of mozzarella!  We each devoured 2 slices, saving room for dessert.  For dessert we shared a cannoli.  We asked before ordering the cannoli if it was made with custard or was it made the right way.  The proper response?  "The right way."  Yummy and rich enough that you have to share.The service from our server Kyle was outstanding and one of the managers, Darren also made sure we were receiving excellent treatment.  All in all, an excellent experience and we'll be back.They take reservations for parties of 5 or more if you call before 4.I like this location better than the one in Old Town, which is the only other location I've been to. It's a pretty small restaurant, but they also have a small private room in the back for gatherings. The ingredients all taste fresh and if you sit at a high top in the bar area you can watch them make the pizza. I love watching the prep! We  actually forgot our leftovers after our last visit and one of the waiters came out to give them to us. So nice!If you're lucky you may find parallel parking spot right out front, but there's also more parking in a big lot just to the west of the restaurant. And the best part is you can walk off your meal by strolling around the shops.If you have read my other reviews, you know that I love Grimaldis and think its the best pizza anywhere outside of Totonnos in Brooklyn.  This Grimaldis was on par with all the others.  FLAT OUT AWESOME!We got 2 pizzas.  A white with pepperoni on it and a regular one with meatballs and roasted red peppers.  Both pizzas were awesome.  I did notice the red sauce here was a little tiny bit more bland than other Grimaldis,  but it didn't hurt the pizza at all.  They slice meatballs really thin and pile them on.  The roasted red peppers are out of this world.  The white pizza has so much flavor with all the olive oil, garlic and cheese they put on.  Fantastic pizzas!Our waiter was friendly and I give mad props to one of the bus boys that works there.  I forgot my hat and he came running out of the restaurant to give it to me.  Awesome service and awesome pizza=an easy 5 stars!I had not been to a Grimaldi's in about five years prior to this visit. I knew that it was a rather pricey pizza restaurant but I was craving pizza and we were at San Tan Mall so I figured I would give it another try. I was with my sister and she did have her dog with her so we asked one of the manager's if we could sit outside on the patio with the dog. At first she said no but then she told us if we could find a seat near the edge of the railing and tie him up on the outside of the rail, we could eat on the patio. We did end up finding a perfect spot where we were able to tie him up and have him right next to us while sitting on the patio. It was really nice of her to let us do that and accommodate our needs with the dog. Good start.We were pretty hungry last night and we both really wanted a starter of some kind, garlic bread, bruschetta, something like that... To our surprise Grimaldi's carries no form of appetizers other than salads. Salads are great and all but we just couldn't believe that they had no other kind of appetizer. When we asked our waitress if they had any sort of bread she  seemed almost irritated that we even asked. We decided that we would just end up ordering a starter caesar salad because really this was one of our only choices. We also ordered a large   pepperoni, onion and jalapeno pizza. The salad was okay. The caesar dressing was a little to bitter for me, a little too much vinegar for my tastes.The pizza here for me is just okay. Some people really love Grimaldi's and to each their own, but it is just not the pizza of choice for me. The crust was a little over done which because of the coal brick oven gave it a slight burned taste. I did like the fresh mozzarella and that was probably the best part of the pizza but I found myself eating around other parts of the pizza just to get to the bits of cheese. I am just not a fan of Grimaldi's pizza and I won't find myself coming back here to pay $22 for a pizza I don't like. The service was pretty good. Our waitress was very attentive. I did get a slight sense of arrogance from her but overall she kept our drinks refilled and she did answer our questions even if she was a little snooty about it. I did give a three star because even though this is not the pizza for me, it is not bad pizza, just not my taste.
Miss Jean Talon=This is back to beloved diner status in my mind, based on a recent visit where I got to experience the full on Miss Jean Talon, not just the glimpse you get from delivery. Big booths, cheap glasses of beer, awesome friendly madame service, all day basic yummy breakfast so you can eat yer eggs in the afternoon while your friends eat a sub and a delicious personal sized pizza. I would totally go back here to eat diner food and drink all day, and if this sounds like joy to you too we should probably be friends.
Quartier-Perse=Quartier Perse is a well established and deservedly popular restaurant that does amazing things to rice and kabobs.This will come as a shock to some, but Persian rice is the penultimate way of preparing rice. It's fluffy and chewy and delicious in a way that no other culture has managed to surpass. To start, we chose a few bowls of Zeytoon Parvardeh, an olive dish with pomegranate paste, walnuts, garlic and herbs. These were eye-crossingly yummy.As a meat aficionado, you should probably order the Soltani #2 combo - a beautiful plate upon which there is a mountain of buttered rice and two kabobs. One, the "Barg", is a beef filet marinated to perfection and cooked to your preference. The other, the "Koubideh" is a minced beef that also is mouth-wateringly delicious. You can shake a little of the powdered Sumac spice on your meat and rice for an added touch of authenticity.Being the Designated Driver I treated myself to a glass of Doogh - a drink that my Iranian friend assured me went well with the cuisine. He was right. Doogh is a savory yogurt based drink that was minty and salty and went perfectly with the meal. He said that Doogh is an acquired taste but really, it took me only two sips to appreciate the beverage and to welcome it into my inventory of "Exotic Things That I Tried That I Thought I Might Not Like But Liked Anyway". My table-mates had the wine that we brought with us. (Quartier Perse is also BYOB in addition to having a Wine and Beer license)What I couldn't eat was loaded into a Styrofoam container and the inevitable discussion with the Missus was had. "Shall we feed the leftovers to the kittens or not?" I voted for my stomach, not theirs and happily savoured my leftover Koubideh and rice the next day.
Prado=This review is for breakfast at Prado...Read on if you're interested in an impressive place for your morning meal!(I hear that lunch and dinner can be inconsistent, but I have a new favorite breakfast place in town thanks to the meal I shared with my HUSBAND on Monday morning at Prado.While I walked by Prado, the Montelucia's main restaurant, several times throughout our wedding weekend, I'd never been in for breakfast or lunch.  So, after a fabulous yoga class at Joya spa on Monday, my HUSBAND (yes, I love saying that) met me for breakfast at Prado.There is patio seating but we sat indoors.  Either way, it's beautiful with a fantastic Spanish decor and ambiance.I went with the egg white omelette, which comes with peppers, spinach, and mushrooms and a side of your choice of toast.  Multi-grain was my choice.  Jared ordered the burrito, which includes scrambled eggs, merguez sausage, onions, potatoes, and pico de gallo.  Each of these items are priced at $10.My omelette was delicious!  It came well done just as I requested and they did not skimp on the veggies.  It was served with a delicious salsa and it was so big I couldn't finish it.  I may just have to return with a friend and order one omelette to share.  I didn't want to stop eating although I was getting full, but Jared was sick of waiting on me.  So, he left me eating and went to go take care of some "business" if you know what I mean.Luckily, our server, Dominic, was super sweet.  He came and chatted with me and kept my water and coffee full.  And he didn't make me feel like an idiot when I asked for sweet 'n low and it was there just hiding in the sweetener box right in front of me.  He also dropped off a special quote of the day with my bill.  My quote reads "Time has a wonderful way of showing us what really matters." (Margaret Peters).  So maybe the quote isn't necessarily UFC as it relates to my review, but if you're up for sharing a well done, fluffy egg white omelette with me for breakfast some time, let me know... we can meet at Prado at the Montelucia!After checking into our lovely suite at the Montelucia my hubby said he was in the mood for some chips, guac and a margarita. I think he had mistaken Scottsdale for Mexico and unfortunately the restaurant at The Montelucia (Prado) had none of the above. Instead we enjoyed a glass of wine (Riesling for me), a bowl of gazpacho and shared the snapper ceviche.  Service was a bit on the slow side, but the tasty food made up for it...We ended up back at Prado the next morning for breakfast- we were quite starving after hiking Camelback (or part of Camelback).  I was a bit disappointed with their breakfast menu. They had very few things to choose from besides the $25 breakfast buffet. I wasn't in a buffet kind of mood, but it didn't seem like we had a choice. However, I seemed to get the most out of my $25 after stuffing my face with an omlette, mini breakfast burrito, fruit, yogurt parfait, etc.  Our waiter did a bit of a disappearing act, but fortunately we didn't need him much for the buffet.They do have some good food, but they could use some more options...and better service.
Famous Uncle Al's Hot Dogs and Grille=I had the beginning stages of my bi-annual physical this morning...after the good doctor (and he is a good doctor...some of the best doctor jokes I've ever heard:) was finished prodding, poking and invasively examining me, I set my Yelp for 'droid on "healthy eating"...the app thought I said "hot doggies" and took me to Famous Uncle Al's (hey, when a computer (no matter how small that computer is) tells you do something, you had better do it:)I am trying now to figure how to rate it...3 Stars?...4 Stars?...Pi Stars? (with apologies to Brian S for the blatant theft of "Pi Stars":-)I don't know...this is a hot dog joint and there are rules...and Famous Uncle Al (not his real name, BTW) breaks nearly all of the rules!Lets take a look at the Rules of Hot Dog Joints, shall we:) - Crappy linoleum floors and counters, accompanied by a "kitchen" in severe need of a degreasing - Not available at FUA:)I swear, I have never seen a cleaner, brighter hot dog joint in my life...you could eat off the floor (or really, pretty much any horizontal surface) in here...the place is just kept in pristine condition:) - A cook who's seen better days and a little bit of attitude from the "help" - Also, sadly, unavailable at FUA:)The little family that owns and operates this franchise greeted me at the door, asked me to sit at one of their lovely clean tables, anywhere I wanted to sit and then waited on me at that table...what a novel concept...service with a smile:) - Crappy, wobbly little tables and a dingy, torn wallpaper motif (with the optional, but ever so popular, "No Pest Strip" dangling from the ceiling)? - Nothing remotely like that going on here:)FUA is open and bright, airy and nicely decorated...they have a nice big LCD TV set on ESPN, or the news or something like that...so I don't have to watch "Lost" reruns on my phone while lunching solo:) - Hot Dogs and buns from the "what we didn't sell last week" bin, served for your pleasure from a grease and water bath - Again, just not how they do things at FUA:)These dogs are alright...certainly on a par with any other decent hot dog joint and better than most:)They serve their variety of dogs in a variety of ways...if you don't see it on the menu as one of their standards, just ask:)...want a brat with mustard, celery salt, relish, red onion sauce and shredded (not melted) cheese?...they are only too happy to accommodate (and for not a lot of cash, either:) - The last rule they break is a doozy, though...hot dog joints are always little and underfunded...a hand to mouth existence for all but a fortunate few - not FUA...a public company traded under the symbol "FDOG.OB"...fdog?...really?...OK:)2 dogs, w/shredded cheese, and a large beverage set me back a cool $9.10 today...for a couple of very good dogs...hey, my physical was arduous...I needed the boost at lunch:)I didn't even have to stand in line for it:)
Le Resto Du Village=Dennis, my partner and I, call this "The Pig Restaurant" as they have so many little ceramic pigs that decorate the dining room. I love this tiny restaurant in the heart of the gay village!Open 24 hrs, this French Quebec cafe has everything from soups, sandwiches, poutine, great coffee, braised beef and carrots, hamburger steak, homemade desserts, yummy breakfasts, and so much more. I love it that I can have all choices at any time. Prices are cheap, cheap, cheap!
Grady's=I had the wonderful opportunity to eat @ Grady's last Friday. The building is in a strip mall just south of Cactus on 19th Ave. Once you enter you see a clean, crisp, and inviting place. There are only enough seats for 10 or so but it is worth eating in the car if you have to. Carolyn and "Grady" are one of the nicest couples you have ever met. Please be sure to critique the food as they are still trying to figure out what we like in N. Phx. I had the pulled pork sandwich with homemade potato salad and a coke. The pork was cooked and smoked to perfection and not a pile of fat. The sauce is a homemade, hot, mild or super hot, all three were good. I used a mix of the mild (Tenn. style) and the hot (more of a Carolina style?) together to make a great mix. The salad was not as good as I hoped and they mentioned making it a little different next time. Did I mention the sauce is for sale? The Banana Pudding was EXCELLENT. Please stop by and talk with the owners, give them your honest opinion and lets keep a great BBQ in N. Phx.Grady and Carol were super friendly creating a downright homestyle, accomodating atmosphere.Just like the food.My brother and I split and shared the pulled pork and the bbq brisket sandwiches.  Both were delicious, but my personal taste preferred the smoky pork.  There are other choices written on the wall, with pictures that make it all look just as good as what I sampled.There are three choices of sauce - Mild, Hot, and Super Hot (which really is!)I thought Hot was near perfect, but did ask for a sample side of Super Hot, which was nice in small amounts, and great mixed with kethcup for the salty and very hot fries.There are cold sides like macaroni and potato salads, etc, and the peach cobbler looked good, but we didn't have it today.Yelpers should be very impressed that once he saw Daren, Grady got all excited about having him try his new variation on the potato salad, since he'd read Daren's Yelp saying that the sides may be a little lacking, and he knew just what was missing and had spiced the dish right up.  Daren confirmed that this batch was quite good and that the things he thought weren't right last time were good now.Grady was very pleased with himself, and Daren enjoyed the taste, but ironically it was the last of the batch and he had to have fries instead!The storefront is in a strip mall that, although a little run down, is nestled nearby a portion of Phoenix Mountain Preserve which beautifies the background.  2 tables and about 5 chairs fill the sit-down portion of the lobby, but with this weather coming right now it shoud be on your list of picnic and reunion weekend get togethers for pickup of catering style takeout.Plus I see a very cramped episode of Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives in their future.See you next time Grady and Carol!!PS: I can't think of any specific thing that makes this only 4 stars instead of 5 except that I just know that it will give me an opportunity (excuse) to try more things right away and bump it up to a 5 soon!Third visit, and she calls me by name upon walking in the door!I made it by for dinner Saturday after trying several times on a Sunday (they get a day off, too y'know)Delicious as usual.  I notice on the menu boards that they are now offering quite a selection.Besides BBQ brisket, pork, chicken, 1/4 or half chicken, wings, ribs, and all the fixin's, they now also offer a bunch of seafood options like fried catfish, etc.I got a tshirt: "I [heart] Grady's BBQ Sauce"Oh, and it's so clean in their kitchen, I'd be willing to eat off of the floor near the baseboard behind the prep table.No kidding, I've seen it.  Aside from that the kitchen was intoxicating me with a smorgas~copia of aromas.  Daren suggested setting up a Special Chef's Table in the narrow hallway, which I heartily agreed with.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4a9JpaxYER0I'll be sad that I can't stop in to my local neighborhood storefront for the best BBQ in phoenix, but I'll get over that since I can go down to the Downtown Farmer's Market every weekend for a fix.I'm downright inconsolable about not being able to see as much of my two friends, Grady and Carolyn.8,^ (Viva Grady's     http://www.yelp.com/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%.
Irish Republic=hate having to do this but there has been a lot of changes at Murphy's in the last year, none of which I can report as being good. This place used to be consistently great with service and food but I'm sad to say it's not anymore. Began earlier this summer when the food started being hit or miss. Some days it was the stellar food we all came in to have at lunch and other days... not so good. To the point that the last three times were bad and the large group of us haven't gone back and probably won't. The food thing came down to if a certain chef was working - if he was there, good; if not, bad. Started asking the waitresses and figured out the trend. Fast forward to today and that chef has left and no longer works there. Which leads me to understand why the last 3 times in a row the food has been subpar. Like what makes a tomato hard? wasn't green or unripe but hard like... tough to cut hard. wtf? I don't know enough to know this is a reason the food has got worse but typically if you're looking to franchise you get different food vendors that can deliver the same type of food to your locations all across the country. So think frozen foods instead of more fresh stuff etc. I mean it makes sense.Also when you have a trained Chef quit whom made great food, and tailored to groups that wanted more expensive off the menu lunches and catered for local businesses & events... something's up. I can only assume it was the quality in food and the new direction... ... meaning... I also found out (chandler news and biz journal) that Murphy's is wanting to franchising and changing their name to Irish Republic and some of what's going on inside. Girls with slightly different garb... kilt's and knee-high's. etc. Not so much breastaraunt-ish but similar. Trademark Info: http://www.trademarkia.com/irish-republic-public-house-85274024.htmlService... much like the food the service has gone down in quality. There never seems to be enough girls during what used to be the lunch rushes and an hour lunch quickly turns into 1:30 lunches waiting on fill-ups and food and the check. It's not horrible service, girls are nice and friendly, just slow. In summary:We haven't returned in at least 4 weeks and it's just not an option when thinking of places to eat downtown Chandler anymore. From 5 to a 2 (meh i've experienced better).I miss what Murphy's was - we all do.
Joe Beef=This is my favourite restaurant in Montreal: hands down, no contest, I want to marry it. I brought 3 restaurant-savvy New Yorkers with me for this food journey and they were blown away with how much Joe Beef rocks.It was pouring buckets outside and the restaurant was warm, cozy and totally hopping when we arrived for our 7pm reservation. After standing there and trying to pick from all of the choices on the chalkboard, I finally hung my head and begged the server for her help. She laughed and then started listing her favourites. We ordered them all, everything from the duck, to the terrine to 3 types of fish. Every bite was incredible, tasty and knee-weakening delicious. The wine my dinner partner picked was perfect with all of our dishes, so good, that we ordered a second bottle.The ambiance of this place is just plain awesome and I adore the buffalo in the washroom, he just makes me happy! This place is food porn at its best and I don't want help for my addiction.I'm not a frequent reviewer of things.  I am, however, a frequent reader of reviews and I hope that these few paragraphs will save you from making a grave financial and culinary mistake. My girlfriend and I first discovered Joe Beef five years ago.   We were looking in antique shops along Notre Dame when we stumbled upon this tightly packed, hole in the wall restaurant.  The menu was on a chalkboard, the waiters were kind and casual and the food was beyond divine.  We ordered about 24 fresh, sweet, New Brunswick Oysters, My girlfriend ordered the Lobster Spaghetti, I got the 49 dollar cut of steak with a slab of Roquefort Blue cheese.  It was delicious, expensive and worth it.  The next year, it was just as good, the following, a little less so, and the same decline the subsequent year.  We skipped last year, because the owners were busy opening their new restaurant Liverpool House.We both wanted to bring my parents to Joe Beef this year, especially because we missed out the year before.  What a mistake. From the moment we arrived, I knew that Joe Beef had radically declined in the last two years.   Joe Beef had died, and his corpse was sitting in a barely air-conditioned room with new tables and terrible food. It was empty at 6:30pm, our appointed reservation time; we were lead from a cool room into a hot back room.  My mother complained about the heat, she is a fit woman whose age I will not betray in this review, but suffice to say, she's earned the right to not sit in 85-degree heat while dropping 50 bucks on entrées.We asked to be moved to a cooler area, they kindly obliged.  That was the last positive event of the night.Here are the lowlights:The waiter walked away from us in the middle of explaining the menu, he returned and hurried us to order, even though we hadn't fully understood the dishes available. After being rushed to order, we waited a total of 1 hour and 10 minutes for appetizers, and another 1 hour and 30 minutes for entrees.My appetizer was supposed to be play on a Mac and cheese terrine with a duck egg on it.  It looked and tasted like the Chef took spam and mixed Kraft Mac & Cheese into it, fried it and put a chicken egg on top.  I know duck egg flavor and it wasn't a duck egg.My mom's cold soup was luke warm.  The waiter fixed this, not by making a new soup, but by trying to put ice cubes in it and re-serving it.  This is a 20 dollar appetizer!My steak with Gorgonzola was dry, grey and rubbery.This was all happening as the waiter kept pretending that nothing was wrong, furiously refilling our waters like we were at a hot dog eating contest, and it's now 85 degrees in the once cool main room.Finally, everything was SALTY, SALTY SALTY.The waiter dropped the bill, NEARLY $400.00 with no discounts for the wait or bad service, plus an extraneous alcoholic beverage that nobody ordered. He apologized at the very end, once he was paid.  We left, united in our dismay at what had happened and knowing that we would never go again. My girlfriend and I knew that we just attended the wake of Joe Beef.  We had pits in our stomachs.Or maybe that was just their heinous Eel Nuggets eating at our stomach linings.Review #500!!Joe Beef was the best restaurant I went to in Montreal, and that's saying quite a bit. I was able to walk-in on one of the more popular restaurants in the city (called for reservations and weren't taking any for a week!). Joe Beef is a small place split off into two different dining areas, with one being the main and the other being a lounge of sorts with the bar. The menu is a chalkboard that hangs high against the wall and consists entirely of French. Within the walls of this tiny little establishment, lay a place that had the intimate feel you look for when you're with your significant other, with food that would put you into a coma. We started the night with eel nuggets....yeah...eel nuggets. There were a lot of starters that looked very good including the foie gras double down, but eel nuggets had to be ordered because I had no idea what that would even taste like. As soon as she saw it on the menu, the gf knew she was getting the Lobster Spaghetti. Likewise, as soon as I saw Duck on the menu, I was getting that.The Eel nuggets are exactly what they sound like. The nuggets were real crunchy as I think they were breaded with cornflakes. The eel filling itself was a mix of eel and potato, so it had a pasty kind of texture. The eel and potato mixture was overly salty while the breading added no real flavor. There was a good hint of smokiness to go along with the app, but I didn't really enjoy it. In fact, it just tasted odd in a bad sort of way. Luckily, the entrees were tremendous. My entree was the Duck with Montreal Smoked Meat. The name itself was enough to ensure that I ordered it. The Duck breast was parted into thick cuts of meat that made it so satisfying and savory. The dish came garnished with small bits of smoked meat and oddly enough, pickles. Surprisingly, the pickles with the duck worked for me. The sauce was savory as well, and the smoked meat did not serve to overpower the duck but add to the dish as a whole. Lobster Spaghetti is simply that. Giant chunks of lobster (shell-on) were tossed with spaghetti in a buttery cream sauce. The lobster meat was very tender and the spaghetti soaked in all that lobster-y brininess. The butter and cream sauce lends itself to being quite heavy, but the gf claims it was one of her favorite dishes ever.If the food wasn't good enough, the service was excellent. Our server Andrew was always around and making sure we were well taken care of despite how busy the place was slowly getting. He was friendly, funny, and seemed like one of the guys who just happened to bring you food. The place, despite it's fame and reputation, doesn't exude a feeling of pretention at all. I fully enjoyed the entire experience and thus truly earned my 5 star rating. Best restaurant in Montreal. Period.No words will do justice to the food here.I've been meaning to come to Joe Beef for a while now, I mean I'm a native Montrealer and just never got the chance while droves of tourists, Anthony Bourdain followers and every chef on earth has been coming here for years.So with last minutes changes, somehow  I finally came last week for a 6pm seating.My dinner companion friend and I were not disappointed. I've seen the photos, I know the call, I knew even before I sat down what I was going to have. For lovers of seafood, the East Coast oysters here are a "must". Briny, juicy and plump and shelled right upon ordering, a quirt of lemon juice is all you need to happily slurp these beauties down.Which then brings me to the Bloody Ceasar. Served in a Mason jar, a stalk of celery, a pickle and an olive dunked within along with a giant shrimp and a single oyster in the half-shell sitting across the mouth of the jar, with spiced chilli salt rimmed around the glass, *THIS* should be the new normal of how all Bloody Caesars should be served the world over, in my humble opinion.I knew I wanted dessert so I knew I couldn't go overboard on everything so to pace myself, I deliberately got a light starter, in this case the watercress soup. If you like things which taste green-ey then you'll love this soup. If on the other hand, green smoothies are not your thing, don't get this. The garlic bread slices which it came with were perfect. I got the spaghetti lobster, a whole flippin lobster, claws, tails and legs, cooked, cracked open, sauteed in some God-knows-what-rich-fatty buttery with parsley concoction along with spaghetti. I was brought up to clean my plate off  and while I was inching closer and closer to the explosion mark, I figured to be good, at least I could polish off the lobster meat, which I did. It turns out I should not have felt so bad. They do doggie bags here, so that rich spaghetti I left on my plate, I was able to take home with me to nosh on the next day.My friend had I think a Cornish game hen, deep breaded with panko, sitting in another ungodly rich sauce. He finished of his bird and had to take the sauce home. I tried a bite and it was also delicious. We also spied over at the table next to us. The couple had ordered probably the most amazing cuts of steak I've seen in a long while, large enough to probably feed a village in Bangladesh . They too were relieved to learn they could take it home as well.For dessert I had the infamous Gateau Marjolaine. Good thing it was a thin slice because this was one of the richest cakes I've had in a while. Because it was my birthday, I got a sparkly candle too! Service was outstanding. Our waitress explained all the dishes to  us and the wine lists as well. After every course, our tables were wiped down, and I even saw Fred and Dave lurking in the back .This is a bucket list restaurant. If you live in Montreal, you have to come here at some point. No excuses.It's just so so. Not worth the money. Seafood platter was fresh. Everything else was either too bland or too salty. Had cod as main dish, no flavour at all. So bland.
Lorenzo's Pizza and Pasta=Hands down, my favorite pizza ever!  I can no longer imagine anything better than Lorenzo's White pizza.  This super simple pie of ricotta, garlic, and mozzarella won me over at first bite, actually at first sight once I saw the size of it.  I owe a HUGE thank you to my husband that could not us.  Had he showed up, he would have insisted on your standard red sauce pepperoni pizza, although I have a sneaking suspicion Lorenzo can conjure up a pretty good pepperoni pie, too.  Even mister red sauce had to admit the leftovers were pretty darn tasty.  And the garlic knots?  Pure doughy deliciousness.  And Shannon M, you displayed the ultimate act of friendship prior to abandoning Arizona, by hooking me up with Lorenzo.  I might need to buy your house just so I can live closer to him!
Europea Restaurant=I'm a foodie, and have been for the last 30 years or so, when I first became an adult, and able to pay for my own dinner.Europea is probably among the top 3 places I've ever eaten. I judge a restaurant by food (includes taste, freshness, creativity with ingredients and presentation), service and ambience. I came here during lunch with my wife, and knew it had good ratings on trip advisor, but wanted to see for myself. This restaurant is booked up about 10 days in advance, so I was able to get a lunch reservation because of a cancellation. My wife and I got there 20 minutes early, they checked my reservation and escorted us to a table right away. The service was phenomenal. We had the Maitre'D and 2 servers waiting on us. They came out with Maple cured beef jerky and goat cheese lollipops, with truffle popcorn as a welcome appetizer. It was great! We ordered a combination of things... the Calamari was sliced to resemble noodles and was so tender and tasty. I got the mushroom and chestnut soup... amazing! We both got the scallops with root vegetables as the entree; the bitterness of the root vegetables perfectly balanced out the sweetness of the scallops. At the end for dessert, I got the chocolate and pistachio truffle and my wife got the Creme Brûlée... both were done wonderfully.The combination of the culinary surprises, and the wonderful flavors in those dishes, married with the service gives this place 5 stars in my book. A must visit. We probably indulged too much, and had several cocktails, which set the bill high, but if we had one glass of wine a piece, the price would have been about $100... which is about what we spend in NYC for a meal that's not equal at all.An absolute gem of a find, and if you have the opportunity to go there, you will not be let down!
Malhi Sweets Indian Cuisine=Malhi Sweets is a few blocks from the north west corner of Jarry Park, seats approx 20 on super clean simple wooden tables and chairs by wide windows. It's not fancy: some Indian art and TV's broadcasting hot Bollywood music videos at a pretty mellow decibel, lots of framed clippings of great reviews and celebrity guests. There's an attentive staff and diverse clientele and everyone is smiling. Today we started with the Aloo Tikki and Malhi Special rolls, both crispy but light and we loaded them with lots of yummy, spicy sauces. I had Aloo ghobi (crazy delicious cauliflower and potatoes) Shahi Paneer (amazing soft homemade cheese in a creamy, tomatoey, Indian spicy sauce) the man had the Goat Curry and declared it his new favourite food. We shared nan - thin, soft, hot, lightly buttery - perfect. We drank frothy sweet lassi's and an Indian beer called Taj Mahal on tap - light refreshing lager that goes great with curry, and they have some other local and Indian mircobrews I'd go back to try. When we could eat no longer we loaded up the to-go tray's, paid our 46$ bill (nice!) and walked off into the sunset.Cet endroit n'a pas du tout été ce à quoi je m'attendais. Avec tous les avis 5 étoiles, je m'attendais à quelque chose de beaucoup plus chic. Le décor ressemble plutôt a celui d'un resto de quartier qui sert des hamburgers donc c'est plutôt pour la bouffe que cet endroit se mérite tant d'étoiles. Et je ne peux m'empêcher que de leur donner une note parfaite tellement les plats sont savoureux. Étant avec une amie végétarienne je n'ai pas goûté à ce que je considère comme étant les classiques avec lesquels je compare les autres restos indiens. Par contre les plats qu'on a partagé étaient tellement délicieux qu'on a léché nos plats jusqu'à ce qu'il ne reste plus une seule goûte de cari à l'aide de nos pain naans géants qui fondent dans nos bouches tellement ils sont frais. On a partagé des samosas,  une autre entrée dont j'ignore le nom, trois currys différents er du riz. On était tellement pleines et en plus il en restait pour un lunch pour deux personnes. Et tout ça pour aussi peu que 35$ taxes et tip inclus.Je suis super contente d'avoir découvert un des meilleurs restos indien de la ville mais je suis triste en même temps parce qu'il est pas mal loin de chez nous. Ça me donnera une excuse de plus pour aller visiter mes amis qui se retrouvent dans ce coin de la ville.
District American Kitchen and Wine Bar=So it may be a hotel restaurant, in a convention hotel, downtown... but this place is for real. The atmosphere is decidedly W, or painfully Scottsdale. It's got the color scheme of Sushi Roku, the vibe of a big city restaurant, and food for gods. It is connected through the lobby of the hotel, but also has it's own entrance, something the other hotel restaurants in the area cannot say. District is also privately owned, so you won't fall victim to any Sheraton miscues in the restaurant here, just thier own which I have to say there aren't many so far. The restaurant is dark and mysterious in the lounge area, and completely open in the dining room, which makes for a great social atmosphere all around. They also feature local artists with the wall art changing monthly, and it's for sale too! I'm glad someone had the foresight to do that, rather than buy some mass produced crap from Malaisa. There is a private boardroom style dining room in the back, with two large semi private dining rooms, and another large dining table overlooking the restaurant, so large parties would be great in this space. I'm thinking the large table in the dining room is the best as you are almost on a king's throne above everyone.The food follows the same cues as the atmosphere. It's familiar, but fun and exciting... they call it "American Comfort" and thats exactly what it is. The menu features Shrimp Po' Boy Sliders, Mussels which come in a ginormous bowl with an incredible sauce, Short Rib w/chipotle grits, salmon, steak, and other familiar dishes with a little local taste. Our table enjoyed everything including the Organic Berkshire Pork with Memphis BBQ sauce, Mac & Cheese, and Applesauce. Also on the table were the Mussels, and the Caesar Salad which might have been the only dissapointment. I ordered the Short Rib, and we all agreed it was one of the best we had ever tasted. They even made Grits delicous. It's obvious that quality has been taken into account as all of the vegetables and meats are locally produced and purchased from small farms. Queen Creek, The Farm at South Mountain, and Schreiner's are just some names that come to mind. The chef was kind enough to come out and introduce himself about mid-meal and I asked him where he came from, the answer pretty much explained the entire evening to me. He is the former Executive Chef of the late Mary Elaine's, Mr. Belosic, and he explained he was just having fun doing something people would be familiar with. There was a dish on the menu that literally everyone would be familiar with, from Fried Chicken or Cod, to a Ribeye. The drink list is pretty standard on the wine side, but the beer list is much more unique, featuring almost solely microbrews from New Belgium, Oak Creek, and Widmer. There is even an organic beer on the list. Though I wasn't drinking last night, I thought $3.75 was enticing enough for a microbrew that I'd go back another day to enjoy.Perhaps the highlight of the night for me was when the bill came, not because I wanted to pay, but because like other restaurants they bring a little something with the tab. Most places do the apropos mints, chocolates, etc. Not District, nope, this place brings you a big cotton candy on a stick, a la the state fair from when I was a kid. How cool is that? The bill came out to about $60 w/o drinks for 3 people, which honestly we felt was very fair, almost as though it were an underpriced Mary Elaine's meal. My only, and I mean ONLY gripe with the restaurant is more with the narrow visioned architects who designed the space. The patio has about a 3.5' cement wall, which is just high enough to make the diner feel disconnected from the street. It would have been really nice to do something glass, or steel, to engage the street and encourage people watching... plus it would feel much less confined, but oh well. I'll go back again, and probably again after that, especially now that I've learned they feature live music Thursday through Saturday. Keep on Keepin' on District, and heres to hoping you open the floodgates of trendy, chic, urban hotspots in Downtown Phoenix.District, it's the restaurant & bar in the newly opened Sheraton in downtown.  What can you say about being at a place on opening really.  It's shiny, the leather is fresh, the decor is new, and so are the staff.  Being the first official day open, there was staff everywhere, but that was taken advantage of quickly.  They all were eager to talk, only thing is most of them have not sampled the full line-up of wares.  I looked for suggestions before ordering, but could not receive any.  By no means did this stop me from trying items though.  The main theme of food and beverages is local, or least from the United States (or territories).  The first thing noticed was the beer on tap, all microbrews, and half of them from Arizona breweries.  The wine list was decent, but 95% of them hailing from California.  Liquor selections were the same, all U.S. made, meaning no tequila.  They were still waiting for half of their bottles to arrive, as the shelves did not match the menu yet.  I suppose items like Tito's Vodka from Texas is not the easiest item to have on hand upon opening.  Although I was promised it would arrive soon.  The menu was not extensive and nothing screamed try me, but a few descriptors did engage my eyes, such as 'angry onions'.  Still, nothing outrageous or unheard of.  Being with a baseball-minded friend, we did sit at the bar (the restaurant being empty) just to have something to watch and decided to sample from several apps.  Local Jerky, as listed, was locally produced jerky ranging from Elk to Buffalo to Turkey.  It came out served on a wooden plank in a small canning jar.  Accompanying it were stone ground mustard, sea salt, and pickled garlic, all in small white angled bowls.  Next item was chips and dips, house-made potato chips in a large bowl on a wooden plank as well.  They came tandem with some very chunky onion dip and boat dip.  The jerky was tasty, with several different styles to gnaw on, it made for a unique gnoshing experience.  The chips were tasty, but about the same as if you made them yourself at home.  Later in the evening we still needed more sampling and ordered up some sweet potato 'tots'.  They were served with ranch on the side and arrived again on the wooden plank.  The tots appeared to have been steamed in Indian tradition.  They were mushy, but in the good sense, and full of flavor.  Overall the food was decent.  The building itself is gorgeous.  The staff needs time to become knowledgeable.  Next time, I may sit and have a full meal.What can I say, except I LOVE District! The street-side dining is great, especially right now when the weather is amazing. The theme American Kitchen & Wine bar runs deep and you will find wonderful, delicious comfort food, carefully crafted by Chef Nathan. My personal favorites are the golden calamari, AZ Sweet Shrimp Po' Boy sliders & the scallops, seared to perfection. Wash it all down with a $3.75 (seriously) microbrew & don't forget to save room for dessert. The pumpkin whoopie pies served with a mini bourbon malt shake will make you greedy & not want to share, but you will because you get 3. They also have some of the most attentive & friendly servers I've ever encountered.Don't worry about parking, District validates for up to 3 hours in the garage. Stop by the Sheraton & give the newest addition to downtown dining a try, you won't regret it!I don't Love District. It's something that I meditated on all day before sitting down to write this review. I have finally come to terms with the fact that I don't love the newest Downtown Phoenix gem, I simply Like. I had my first visit to District last night after I made a last minute decision to go celebrate my birthday a little early with Mr. Hottie. I was a little worried about getting a reservation at such short notice, but to my surprise, I was able to secure an 8:30pm reservation over the phone. We arrived dressed to kill and feeling excited to try the new restaurant. We opted to use the valet which is free for the first 3 hours of your visit when you get your ticket validated. We were greeted very warmly by the valet attendants and directed to the restaurant. When the doors to the hotel opened, the first words out of my mouth were "Oooh Pretty!" The open floor plan of the entire place was just breathtaking. As we walked toward District, I even noticed the "New Hotel Smell" which was nice!When we got to District we were met by the hostess who found our reservation and walked us to our table. We were seated close to a big picture window with a nice view of the street. Our waitress, Anastasia introduced herself and subsequently butchered Mr. Hottie's last name (under the assumption it was also my last name) and said "Heard it was your birthday! Happy Birthday!" Ugh...maybe I was just hungry and cranky. She asked us if we had been there before and went on to describe the style of food, and when I asked who her chefs were, she asked if I was with Starwood. Um...no. I didn't let her know that a review would soon be written about this new spot. After she finished stumbling through who the chefs were, we were given a basket of black bean & corn rolls with a jar of chow chow & a flavored butter drizzled with honey. I wished the rolls were warm. I think they would have been so much better and possibly release the full flavor of the butter. I tried the chow chow. Wow. I was immediately transported to Louisiana at my Grandpa's kitchen table. Talk about fresh, crispy and tangy good! We ordered a drink before dinner. I had a glass of Mumm Brut Sparkling Wine; Mr. Hottie ordered the Ocean martini after our waitress stumbled through the ingredients of each martini. She couldn't remember the names of the alcohols that were used in the drinks. After a bit, it was like we were playing a round of an alcohol themed guessing game. Slightly annoying, but again, I thought maybe I was being over critical. It was time to order the food. To start, I chose the chicken tortilla soup. Mr. Hottie chose the local field greens and herbs. The soup was served in a large bowl that came with diced chicken, diced queso blanco, diced avocado, a large dollop of sour cream and thin strips of tortilla chips. The soup is then poured over the ingredients. Talk about delicious. The soup was creamy and savory. The only thing I wished it had was just a little spicy kick, but the soup was so good on it's own. Mr. Hottie said the salad was just ok. The dressing seemed to be a little light in flavor that the goat cheese over powered the salad's flavor. Just prior to having our main entrees served we had ordered a glass of wine to go with our meal. We were well into our meal once the glasses arrived. Points off. Oh well, on to the main event.For my entree, I had the Grilled Ribeye rare. The steak came with skillet potatoes, Toy Box tomatoes and was topped with chimchurri. The steak was perfectly cooked and the meat was extremely tender. I was delighted by the quality of the meat. The only bad thing about it was that it was a very fatty steak even for a Ribeye. It should have been a bit more trimmed up. The tomatoes were fresh and provided a nice bit of acid to the rich plate of meat and potatoes. Mr. Hottie had the Brown Ale Short Ribs. The entree came cheddar jalapeno grits and the meat was topped with roasted carrots. What can I say about the dish? The grits were an absolute tragedy. They were runny and came with a skin over the top of them. The grits were just soupy and disappointing. The short rib was very good. It wasn't fatty rather it was a rich slice of meat that was well seasoned. I didn't try the small bits of carrots that came on top of the short rib but they looked very good! For dessert I was offered a complimentary hot fudge sundae. I was full, but accepted it for the sake of trying it. The sundae came with a cold brownie. The "hot fudge" was lukewarm chocolate sauce.  So yes, you guessed it, points off. Our waitress comes fumbling back to our table to deliver the check and states that she gave us the wrong (and subsequently cheaper) wine. Ah. Points off.  A neat ending to the meal was the free cotton candy. I don't know if I'll return to District. Maybe to try some of their other small plates, and have a few drinks. It just isn't the great dining experience I was expecting, and I'm ok with that.This was really 3.5 stars and I'm rounding down to 3 for a few reasons...on which I will now elaborate.District could be in any Sheraton, anywhere.  In fact, it is strikingly similar to Rum Fire, the trendy restaurant in the Sheraton Waikiki where I stayed for a few days this summer before my family arrived and we stayed moved to the family place.  The flooring, the red circular lounge area, the live music on Thursday nights...it was all the same.  Heck, even the menu was the same.  The difference was that in Waikiki there was a "Hawaiian" slant to everything and the live music was much, much better.  (And of course the beach front setting).  I get the impression that they are trying to market themselves as a "downtown restaurant" more than the "place in the Sheraton"...but to be honest, it is your quintessential trendy hotel restaurant.The bartenders were really friendly.  The wine list for a "wine bar" is incredibly lacking.  Nothing interesting, nothing fun.  The pricing is on par with what I would expect from a hotel.  The space is modern and trendy, something that there isn't that much of in downtown.  I love the charm of a historic home, but I also love sleek and modern lines.We selected a few small plates, or appetizers, depending on which of their menus you are looking at.  The crab cakes were good, if nothing short of predictable, and the chips and dip were surprisingly unique.  A dill dip and a French onion dip provided a nice departure from the regular spinach artichoke.  I'm not sure this is a place that I would come to for dinner, and it is definitely not a place I would come to for brunch.  (The brunch menu is a typical hotel menu, with typical hotel pricing).  I think that for me District will just remain a place for drinks and small bites.  I'm not going to lose my mind over this place.  It's not that great, I'd say it's fairly generic.  But the staff was friendly and it's within walking distance of my place.  I'm sure I will be back for drinks.Umm, made from scratch Sloppy Joes and fancy Mac and Cheese?? Pshh, you had me at Sloppy baby...The fact that there are any sub-par reviews of this place shocks the hell out of me. I had my third meal at District last night, and just like my previous two, it was spectacular.In the business of full disclosure, my friend and I were going to try Moira for the first time, but alas it was closed, and obviously a sign because we stumbled a few blocks further south to District and had quite the satisfying meal.We walked in about 6:45, and I'm sad to report the place was empty.  We took a seat at a cocktail table in the bar area so I could watch the hockey game (seriously, I am a dream date) and perused the bar menu. A nicely mannered waitress approached us almost immediately and remained attentive and helpful throughout our entire meal.The coolest thing about the bar menu was their new take on the pairing menu.  No longer do you have to be a wine conosseur to enjoy the Chef's special menu.  District offers three separate 3 course tasting menus, one featuring a wine pairing, one featuring a cocktail pairing, and one featuring a beer pairing all for between $12 and $14!  I mean, how cool is that?  I challenge you to find a better bargain for such high-quality fare complete with booze...give it up, you can't, I've looked.  If you don't know already, District offers about 10 or 12 different Microbrews on tap an obvious plus for a beer drinker like myself.Being the difficult diner that I am, I asked for the Sloppy Joe Sliders off the beer pairing menu so I could get a couple other small things and try a bunch.  Yes, I am an adult, and no, I can't not order a Sloppy Joe when it is featured on a menu, I'm sorry, I just can't.And thank goodness I lack that sense of propriety because the Sloppy Joe Sliders were freaking fantastic!! 3 perfectly sized mini toasted buns filled with possibly the best, spiciest Sloppy Joes I have ever eaten. Seriously, I sucked down my Apricot Ale seemingly in seconds thanks to the District's take on this classic!  Just don't tell my Mom, she still convinced I'm quite fond of her Mamwich Joes...I also had to get a side of their Andouille infused Macaroni and Cheese, another embarrassing thing that I just can't not order if it's offered on a menu, and it did not disappoint.  Cheezy, creamy, gooey perfection. My only complaint is that I was so full from my Joes I barely made a dent in my Mac n Cheese...alas, there's always next time.My dining companion ordered what must have been the biggest freaking burger I have ever seen, but to be honest I did not really look or care because I was far too enamored with my meal to be distracted by anything else.All in all, I had a spectacular meal at the District, from beginning to end.  If you haven't checked out this gem at the new Downtown Sheraton, do yourself a favor, you'll be in for a treat.OMG I'm stuffed.  I think I need a wheelchair to get around the office now...O gawd!So my coworker took me out to lunch today, and this is where she took me.  Its right outside of my office, so all we really have to do is cross the street to get to it.  I've been in here before, and always love it.Place is obviously well decorated.  Service is quick and friendly.  I liked thier menu selections.  ordered a cheeseburger, which came with fries!  I loved the presentation of it!  Fries came in a brown baggie!  My friends Mayo came in a tiny little one serving bottle.  Very pleasing to the eyes!   Food here is tasty, and delicious!  On the fancier side for having a burger, but Im not to much of a fancy eater these days. The burger itself was really delicious.  I got it with Cheese.  The only thing is that the fries were horribly oversalted!! UGH.  I couldn't even finish them!  My one coworker who eats here all the time said that the fries are always WAY to salty and is unsure of who to talk to about it.  Being that I dont eat here often, Im not sure either..plus, since Im not a regular, I dont want to go in there and be like "hey your fries are ALL ENTIRELY salt" and then leave....blah. Anyways...Place was great, will return in a heartbeat!Decided to take a road trip from south Scottsdale and have dinner downtown.  Within walking distance of our next stop, District fit the bill.  I was really impressed with the design of the restaurant.  Great windows, lots of trees, inside and out, nice patio complete with a hungry kitty I spotted.  I was surprised by the lack of customers on Saturday night, but it was Halloween.I decided to try something new and not have a meal before the meal, so we skipped appetizers.  They do serve bread before the meal, but it's just a standard dinner roll that really should be served warm, but isn't.  For my entree, I had the cedar roasted salmon with risotto.  The salmon was served on the plank with crispy shallots.  The preparation was simple, no special sauce or anything, but the fish was cooked perfectly.  The risotto was filled with shrimp, asparagus, and parmesan cheese.  Although maybe just a little on the salty side, it was delicious.  My husband had the lobster pot pie.  When it's presented, you will think it's ginormous, but it's really just the puffed pastry.  Once you pop it, it's a manageable portion.We opted to share a dessert and went with pecan pie spring rolls.  These, too, were served on a plank with a caramel dipping sauce and bourbon chantilly.  Quite good, although I thought the plank made it awkward to share this dessert.  And speaking of sharing, you may want to ask about portion size before opting to share.  Our dessert was three small rolls that was perfect to share if you just want a little something sweet.  But if you expect to completely indulge, might want to order your own.  Unless, you're going to stick with the complimentary cotton candy at the end of the meal.  If they had a carousel out front, you could save a lot and skip the fair!As far as service, it is a little slow.  But it's slow as in "relax and enjoy your evening" slow, not "where the hell is my stinkin' food" slow.  And the server did ask if we had a theater performance to catch, so it appears they make the effort to ensure you're out on time.Definitely worth coming to again sometime!2.5 starts for really crappy service!!!For such a nice place, you'd think they'd have better service.  Holy frijoles, it sucked!  I went for the game night that Glenn and Bri planned.  I finally saw a guy walk by in a suit and said (in my not-so-quiet voice) "I'll never come back here again."  He came right to our table with more Yelpers and said "Are you guys the Yelpers?"  I had to actually raise my hand, like in 3rd grade, the rest of the night to get refills on my drink.The food was good.  Only good.  The crab cakes were AWESOME.  Huge hunks of crab, and only crab, coated with a light crumb and served on a sauce with REAL horseradish.  The fries?  Not so good.  Their only saving grace was that they were coated in Old Bay seasoning.  They were just normal shoestring fries, though.I really doubt I would go back just to eat.  The ambience is really nice, though.  I just think that for a hotel restaurant, which in itself is in the HOSPITALITY industry, they'd have better service.  At one time, our server even changed color!  He said he was from Cuba.  I called him Fidel.  He laughed.I know I enjoy food when I think about how good it was later..like days and days later. It has been about a week and I am still craving the Mac n' Cheese I inhaled during my Happy Hour visit. The Macaroni was cooked to perfection, the cheese was the perfect consistency and texture, and the addition of spicy sausage really set the dish apart. While the service was impossibly slow, every waiter I came in contact with was extremely nice. But nice or not, I was sucking on melted ice for half the night while I waited to get my drinks refilled. No bueno. The atmosphere was relaxing and casual, and the bathrooms were fabulous!! Well lit, great aroma, and my choice between cloth hand towels or paper. The bathroom had well placed mirrors which made the space feel big and clean.I will definitely come back, but next time I might sneak in my own drink.I've been to District a few times - both for lunch and for dinner... It's a great place to meet if you are heading to the Herberger for a show or if you find yourself in the heart of downtwon PHX either hungry or thirsty.  They make a great burger and have some really awesome happy hour deals on both food and drinks.  I will mention however, that the service isn't so spot on.  Most recently, I sat at the bar with my dad.  We had just over an hour to order and eat before heading to see ATC's production of Lombardi at the Herberger, so we weren't super rushed, but I also knew it wouldn't be the most leisurely meal.  The bartenders didn't address us when we sat down.  After more than five or ten minutes, I finally got their attention and was told they'd be with us in just a moment... I went to the hostess stand to grab menus, and several minutes later, they finally addressed us and took our drink order.  We both went with burgers and I also ordered a Caesar Salad.  My salad never arrived, but I didn't mention it... I was just happy that our burgers came out with enough time for us to scarf them down before the show.  I will say - the burger was cooked just right and worth the wait!Bottom line: From my experience, District is A-OK for their location and happy hour, but I probably wouldn't suggest it as a destination for the evening on its own!I love this place and so do my clients and colleagues who are downtown.  They never hesitate when I book a lunch meeting here.  There are so many interesting items on the menu, but my favorite is the Chef's Trio.  The last visit, this is what was on the Trio:Chef Trio (Beef Soup, Potato Salad w/Bacon, Veggie Calzone), $10http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/district-american-kitchen-and-wine-bar-phoenix-2?select=g6iPj5WpOU-IUMDzdGwXTw#g6iPj5WpOU-IUMDzdGwXTwhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/district-american-kitchen-and-wine-bar-phoenix-2?select=q-jiqBVGITDHYrfW2nwkhQ#q-jiqBVGITDHYrfW2nwkhQhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/district-american-kitchen-and-wine-bar-phoenix-2?select=BJBGLXK8LcaZtear6hwTOQ#BJBGLXK8LcaZtear6hwTOQhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/district-american-kitchen-and-wine-bar-phoenix-2?select=4E90w9JyCNDGIJ2szOhhtg#4E90w9JyCNDGIJ2szOhhtgI started with the Beef Soup, which was simply AMAZING!  The Beef was of high quality and full of flavor.  Just the right portion size too.  Next I had the Veggie Calzone....I have to admit, I was a little skeptical of that part of the dish, but they delivered....it was awesome.  The best part of the dish though was the Potato Salad w/Bacon.....that's right folks, it has BACON in it!!!  It tastes as good as it sounds.  The Bacon does not overwhelm the flavor of the Potato Salad, it compliments it.  It also has very sharp flavors and rounds out the trio dish well.  Well done chef, well done!I can't wait until our next lunch downtown!Return Factor - 95%
The Deli=I have to go on the record as saying that this place is great! The Mr and I were out in QC picking up porky bits at the Pork Shop and wanted to try something new out there. Seeing that this place has been on my radar for ages it was about to to give it a try. I am kind of surprised that no one has been out here and Yelped it yet. This place is amazing!! Chef driven, artisan, seasonal menu and specials with great pricing it doesn't get much better than this. After browsing their farmers market (Saturdays only) and being greeted by an really super nice guy (I'm presuming one of the owners) we had a really good vibe on the place. The inside is both comfortable and relaxed with Led Zepplin and the Beatles playing in the background. We started with the Warm Prosciutto Wrapped House Made Mozzarella ($4.50).. all I have to say is that I wish I had a nice glass of red to go with this tasty treat! The prosciutto was awesome but the house pulled mozzarella, to die for! In fact it was so good we asked to buy a pound to go! On the plate was also a nice slathering of pesto to compliment each bite.. this stuff should be jarred and sold! If I wouldn't come off as rude and desperate I would have easily licked the plate.Next up we shared a side of their house made dill pickles ($1.50).. a nice bowl filled with tender well spiced pickles.. man, I sure love a nice pickle! Juicy with slightly crunchy tenderness these were so good I just about scarfed the bowl myself. Next up we ordered Marinated Mushroom ($3.50) which came with toasted slices of Simply Bread cibatta. Each tender bite was a flavor explosion of earthy sweet balsamic tastiness, here comes that wine craving again. The deal here is that I'm low carbin' so it took some restraint not to tear into the bread with the mushrooms. Fortunately the Mr isnt low carbin' so I was able to live vicariously through him, he shook his head in pleasure.  Up next were our lunch entrees, the Mr had the 1/2 Cuban Sandwich and a bowl of soup ($9). The soup was sausage white bean that I could smell from across the table. He went ahead and got me a nice spoon full of seasoned broth and a large thick slice of sausage. Okay there is soup and there is soup, this was excellent. Hot, creamy and deeply satisfying this was one of the quality your Italian grandmother would have made for you as a kid! The Cuban sandwich was huge tender slices of Roast Pork, Ham melted Provolone, House Sweet Pickles, Dijon Aioli on Ciabatta Bread. Uh, come on now, seriously? This is just about everything you could ask for in a sandwhich. Chewy fresh baked bread, hot slices of slightly salty meats and melted cheese, major love was dripping from this sandwich.My lunch was the Chopped Chef Salad w/ Romaine Hearts, Turkey, Bacon, Tomatoes, Cucumbers, Egg, Red Onion, Avocado & Blue Cheese Dressing ($12). Low cabin' doesn't get much better than this! Each bite was absolutely different with combination of so many fresh and tasty ingredients. Pay close attention to the turkey, they roast it in house along with the roast pork in the Cuban. They take simple ingredients and combine them to create such delicious hearty flavors all working in unison. While The Deli is out of the way it is so worth the drive to Queen Creek for lunch or dinner. Please take the drive, I seriously don't think you're going to be disappointed one bit!
Tuck Shop=For the Coronado district, Tuck is the most exciting thing we've seen in quite some time to arrive in the neighborhood.  Walking and driving past it, we've been watching the restaurant being built with lots of anticipation and excitement of what was going to arrive.  So I was really excited to walk by this past Thursday to see it open for business.  I went in just to grab a menu, and instead met the bartender and manager, and enjoyed a great Four Peaks Coronado Ale and got to find out what the place is all about.  The decor of the restaurant is beautiful: There is great art work covering the walls from a Tucson artist that is all for sale, and the mismatched chairs with the quaint reading room off to the side, combined with the wood detail throughout the bar was beautiful.  The bathrooms were even amazingly decorated with the greatest sinks!  Anyways, I went back tonight to finally have a full meal to find a completely packed house.  For only being open a week, I couldn't get over the fact that it seemed like everyone from the neighborhood was there and then some, it was so great to see. But, back to the food- I finally got to try my prosciutto and mac and cheese, and it was amazing!  Followed up with a dirty martini, it was definitely a great meal and experience. My only fear is that it is going to turn into a constant happy hour spot for when I walk past it on the way home from work...Don't go here- it's terrible!!.........OK, in all honesty, I've been putting off writing a review on Tuck Shop because I love it so much and fear that I may never be able to get a table once the word gets out. That said, I have been here 4 times already and it's been outstanding every time. John the manager is awesome, as are all the servers. The place is cozy and inviting- it kind of feels like a swanky ski lodge with mod furniture where all your friends hang out. The menu is split up into starters, small plates and larger entree-sized items which are suitable for sharing, but you certainly don't have to. Some of my favs are the fish and chips, the chorizo stuffed dates, the fried chicken and cheese waffles, and the anchovy-stuffed potatoes. They also sometimes have a Bananas Foster dessert that is to die for. Very unique and fresh menu.For the atmosphere, quality and variety of food, the prices are reasonable, and they have an eclectic and reasonably priced drink menu as well. Combine all this with the fact that I can walk here from my house pretty much ensures a long standing love affair.After reading a few reviews I was really tricked into thinking the portions would be minuscule. Like french-modern-cuisine tiny, but luckily I was wrong. I erred on the side of thinking the portions would be small so I ordered us two starters but we could have just done with one. However, they were both drool-worthy. One was the baguette with creamy garlic, it consisted of  6 slices of bread with a whole garlic cooked until it's spreadable covered in olive oil and spices. Basically you scoop a clove out and spread it on the bread. This was good, like drool-on-you-keyboard-good (DOYKG). We also ordered the Nosh plate,a typical melon, meat, cheese and nuts plate. Everything on that was tasty and both would have been great alone, but I'm glad we tried both.For main courses my gf ordered the mac and cheese with prosciutto and breadcrumbs and liked it. I had Vovo's special which is a rotating special. Last night it was the tamale and tortilla soup. We both liked our dishes and were stuffed. I was a little envious after seeing another couple's dish. They ordered the chicken and waffles. It wasn't your typical soul food style but it looked tasty regardless. We both had wine. Gf had the Rose which she thought was a little dry and I wasn't too fond of either. I had the Tempranillo which I liked but wasn't amazing. That's probably the only gripe, I wish their wine list was deeper.All in all the place was awesome and a great date destination. Romantic lighting and original decor and architecture, good for conversation starters.The crowd was older that I expected, not a negative just an observation, although it was a Thursday and that might change on weekends. The service was nice and the free after dinner snack. Chocolate covered cookie dough was like pastry crack and also (DOYKG).Side note: The prices aren't cheap but they won't break you. Especially if you go to other establishments in the same area. My tab for this meal was $60 which is good I think. Two sides, two glasses of wine, one main course and one small course. Not bad as far as I'm concerned.I really enjoy this place. It's beautifully designed. It's hidden in a historic neighborhood, (zoning issues so no patio), and they make they own tonic! ---What else does one need? But now the food. Rich, full flavored, comfort food. I don't think there is a cuisine style here as far as I could tell, just some of the best food around. Had the fontina crusted with pinko and walnuts, awesome. A potato side dish, damn good I tell you. For the main course the skirt steak, which was some of the best red meat I'm had in a very, very long time. This is my vote for best new restaurant in Phoenix. Seriously.A late night cocktail was the occasion for my first visit to Tuck Shop, where I sat on a couch with friends, surrounded by water games popular in the late '70s early '80s (and other novelties) and enjoyed a Pimm's and housemade ginger ale. It was a classic, comfortable environment and I couldn't wait to come back! In spite of our group's VERY late arrival, the staff was so gracious and accommodating. (Plus, I loved, loved, loved my drink!!) When I returned for dinner, I was not disappointed! We started with panko walnut-crusted fontina which was offered with two dipping options: a roasted red pepper one,  which I expected to prefer, and pear and onion, which, surprised me and made the best partner! A lovely upscale twist on the traditional "fried cheese" appetizer.That's how this whole place is, though. It takes something you're used to and kicks it up a few! Take for example the yukon jacket potatoes - not your typical roasted potatoes; these are cored and threaded with bacon, anchovy and sage. The presentation was very cool. And, the cores that also appear on the plate are delicious topped with lemon zest and olive oil! Sticking with a "meat and potatoes" theme, we had the spiced skirt steak which was tender and well seasoned -- served on the rare side. It filled a large plate and resulted in left overs even though two of us were sharing! The mushrooms were so good, I would order them as a side on another visit if that were an option!! For me, the most overwhelming flavor in the parmesan lentil mashed potatoes was BUTTER! But, when it comes to mashed potatoes that is NOTHING to complain about: It was creamy heaven!  I couldn't possibly find anything to complain about with Tuck Shop. Generally, I despise sitting at community tables but we didn't think quickly enough to decline (although, we were asked if it was OK) when getting seated. Although, in the future I would prefer my own table, the people we were seated with were so nice and friendly. We wound up sharing our food!Finally, in case you missed it in the other reviews: Move over Andes! There's a a ball of raw cookie dough - that's right. You heard me: cookie dough! Rolled in chocolate that comes with your bill. I whole heartedly recommend checking this place out for a nice classy, cozy meal!When they say neighborhood, they aren't kidding, literally in the Coronado residential neighborhood at 12th street and Oak, the restaurant lives in an old building that once housed the Arizona Showmen's Association. The rehab has been lovingly restored by its owner DJ Fernandes who is also not by coincidence an architect. When pulling up you can see such attention to detail and design from the concrete stamped handicapped spot, to the interesting lights and exterior brushed stainless door pulls. When entering the building be sure to check out the signage made up of letter building blocks, clever and grounding. Rehabilitation like this helps make the Phoenix area so interesting and original.The inventive menu was designed by DJ, his girlfriend Jessica Ruiz and chef/consultant Mitch Hoverman, who interestingly also opened Palette. The idea is to share plates amongst a group of friends, though you can easily put together a traditional 3 course meal if that is what suits you best. We opted to share our plates so we could try as many as possible. To best describe the menu it would be eclectic, with Creole, French and Spanish twists. There are 3 sections to chose from, Start, Smaller Plates and For Sharing, the menu is accessible and interesting.Starting things out, while the grilled baguette ($5) might sound ordinary, its crispy and light goodness comes from Simply Bread. Accompanied is a whole head of roasted garlic and finished with Bariani olive oil. The Bariani is essentially liquid gold with its grassy mild and pure unfiltered flavor. If there is any left in the bowl when you're done don't let the waiter take it away, it's to precious to be wasted and will taste great on just about anything. Together with the nosh plate ($7) it's all about simple clean flavors. Salted melon, Molinari &amp; Sons salami, manchego cheese and toasted pistachio's were so delicious it was hard to share though there was plenty for all. Panko walnut-crusted fontina ($6) was perfectly crunchy and with each bite the melted strands of the fontina cheese were delightful and satisfying. Patatas bravas ($5) are classic tapas however the Tuck version turns potato cubes into long thick planks served along side of 2 dipping sauces. The planks were lightly crispy and well seasoned, though dipped into the aioli and the spicy tomato sauce together was good, love came from dipping into the remaining Bariani olive oil.Working into the Smaller Plates menu, the panini bites with prosciutto ($9) were so good we were squabbling over the last piece. A nice slab of ciabtta bread stuffed with grilled pear, taleggio cheese, arugala and honey was a sweet and savory combo that has to be tasted and savored. Order 2, one for the table and another wrapped up to go for lunch the next day. Another contrasting sweet and savory small plate would be the medjool dates stuffed with chorizo and topped with melted gruyere ($9). I've had many of stuffed dates, but never like this, spicy and sweet, chewy and meaty, very nice! The mac and cheese with crispy prosciutto, topped with breadcrumbs and lobster ($12) was sublimely creamy and tender, like a really good hug where you just melt into his arms, bury your face into his chest while you're enveloped in comfort and security. Who knew mac and cheese could make you feel so good?!Turning our attentions to the citrus-brined fried chicken ($17) was a sight to behold. 3 large, generously battered pieces of deep fried passion caused instant salivation. I have to say that this was the juiciest tenderest fried chicken I've ever had the pleasure of sinking into. The crunchy coating, the moist flavorful chicken and the slight citrus after taste were absolute perfection. Along side was a large white cheddar waffle, slathered in maple butter and a bowl of pork laden collard greens. The waffle had a light, fluffy and almost mashed potato consistency that was fork tender and soaked up the chicken juices easily. The collards were nice and porky with that slight bitterness only tempered by salt and sugar.  This plate was simply amazing!For the beef eaters there is a spiced skirt steak ($18) served with parmesan lentil mashed yukons and mushrooms, that was so hearty and delicious, I can't imagine having this anywhere else.There is usually only one way to finish a good meal like this and that's with my favorite self proclaimed food group, chocolate. We all tore into the chocolate brownie and almond cream ($7) with a vengeance. You could tell with each bite that this was no box mix, crackly shininess on top, moist and crumbly, this was a great brownie. If this is too much you will also a receive a 1 bite postre with your check. On this night it was raw chocolate chip cookie dough with a slathering of melted dark chocolate, happy ending!The stars are aligned for the Tuck Shop. With all of their elements in near perfect cohesion, this will soon be one of the coolest and freshest places to eat, drink, and of course share.Don't get me wrong ... this is an AWESOME place, just not for me.We originally planned to go to Lo-Lo's but it was closed, so we headed here (as I knew they had Chicken and Waffles) instead. The chicken was over done (just like my Mommy used to make) and the waffle, well it was "fancy" (not your normal waffle which is what I had kinda wanted). Don't get me wrong it was okay, just different and came with no syrup, 'cause it was cheese based and that wouldn't work so well.Our real server was kinda pushed out by another server (thank GOD, as our "real" server looked like he had a few years of substance abuse behind him) and our new one was GREAT. We collectively assumed that that this our original servers last night at the place.That said my girl absolutely loved the food so take my review with a grain of salt. Also it should be duly noted that the place is incredibly hip and beautiful, and drink prices reasonable (two great Four Peaks beers on-tap).So here's the deal ... go here and ignore this review (sorry I wasted your time). :)Oh shit! I almost forgot ... the free desert (chocolate cookie dough is the freakin' greatest treat any restaurant has ever given me ... EVER!)I like Tuck Shop. I like when you first walk up to the building, you feel like you're walking into a small day care center (note the building blocks out front). When you walk into the building, you're in a cozy space that reminds one of a hip and modern cabin feel. I've been to Tuck about 3 times now and each time I leave happy. It starts with the host. There's nothing like being greeted like a regular when you've only been in once or twice. I love how friendly the Host, John, is. On my last visit, we had a group of 7 and we didn't have a reservation on a Saturday evening. John was more than accommodating. He invited us to sit at the bar while he made arrangements to get our rowdy (post beer festival) group in to eat. The way I would describe the food at Tuck is "home cooked meals made fancy". There is a variety of things to try! If you are a vegetarian, some dishes can be made meatless, but not all. If you want something spicy and with a lot of kick, try the red beans and rice. I think that's my favorite dish so far. My least favorite is the chicken and waffle. The chicken was good, and flavorful, but the waffle wasn't interesting to me. I was wishing for some syrup or a cool sauce to go along with the dish. Tuck also offers small plates that are tapas-like. Go for the patatas bravas for a simple appetizer. Tuck Shop is, in my opinion, a neighborhood jewel. It offers comforting dishes and great drinks, not to mention good service. I have made Tuck Shop one of my regular noshing spots!I love this place. The concept of sharing really does it for me (thanks mom). You get to try so many dishes instead of just one, it's like taking your taste buds on an adventure. I've been here twice now and already have some faves: Nosh plate - melons, salami, manchego, pistachios Dates - stuffed with chorizo and gruyereMac and Cheese - with prosciutto and breadcrumbsI can't wait to go back and try the waffle fries. Oh yea and they have Tito's vodka. Big Score!Everything about this place is out of the norm in a very good and inviting way. Major points on the curb appeal from rock wall to innovative use of nostalgic wooden letter blocks as signage. The attention to detail is refreshing and appreciated.  The interior is welcoming and the creative use of space is impressive. How does one fit a lounge, bar and dinning area in such a tight space and mitigate claustrophobia? This is worthy of an HGTV episode.  Tuck has done it & done it well! The menu is just as creative and unique in its own right. I've enjoyed the roasted grape crostini, chorizo stiffed dates, mac & cheese w/lobstah, special meatloaf with potatoes & chorizo and the chocolate cheese cake. All hit high marks for flavor, portion and presentation. The service is consistently impeccable from courteous host to attentive but non-intrusive servers. I always feel welcomed and appreciated!  Tuck Shop is in my top five places I love and enjoy introducing to friends, co-workers, and out of town guests. It holds a very warm place in my heart with many fun and special memories.I feel like it's been forever since Tuck Shop opened and it's taken me all the way until now to actually go!  That has more to do with the fact that I have the eating habits of a geriatric and like to eat at 4, and places like this don't open until 5.  My first impressions were that this was a very cute little restaurant with homey touches here and there but not without it's own modern flair.  The tables and chairs are all mismatched, but thankfully at appropriate heights.  I liked the faux ceiling that gave the impression that it was lower in the middle, but I can see other people really hating that.  The staff was all friendly and knowledgeable and the guy who I am guessing is the owner had some really amusing shorts on.The food was wonderful.  There was lots that looked good on the menu to us, and it was too difficult to narrow it down to one sharing plate, on top of the appetizer and small plate we ordered, so we went ahead and got two.  We started with the walnut crusted fontina, and that was delicious.  It was served with a sweet and earthy pear sauce as well as a roasted red pepper sauce.  They were delicious when swirled together.  Next we had the mac and cheese with the lobstah added.  I really liked the mac and cheese.  It was tender with a real down home sauce with just the right amount of cheesy flavor and warmth.  The lobster was quite unique.  It had a great woody flavor that I didn't expect but I found to be really appropriate for the dish.  Finally, I had the citrus brined fried chicken and white cheddar waffle.  It was ambrosial.  The chicken was the best fried chicken I have ever had.  It was intensely crispy and the citrus brine gave it a whole new flavor profile that I was not ready for.  The white cheddar waffle was yummy, but a little too eggy for my liking.  It did however, go extremely well with the chicken,I really enjoyed my visit here, and I hope to come back sometime soon.I still love this place! The menu has some seasonal changes. Right now, you won't find the  panko walnut-crusted fontina or the yukon jacket potatoes but you WILL find "crispy shrimp and okra" which are fried treats that have both shrimp and okra in each puff! Delicious! And, oyster po'boy popovers (4 per order) which made some in our party think of Big Macs - only with oysters. Fortunately, the pine spiced skirt steak is still available -- with those "to-die-for" mashed potatoes. BUT, it's a tough decision now with the juicy pork t-bone, perfectly crisp green beans and tasty squash gnocchi.Bottom line is: this place rules! You can't make a bad order. And, it's all about sharing any way. Isn't that what our world needs more of? Places that promote sharing!!Oh WOW!!!! I've only heard about this place through the reviews on Yelp, and from those alone I KNEW I had to go here! So the hubs and I set out on Saturday night at about 630ish. We arrived and it was already pretty busy. All the tables were seated and there were people in the lounge area. However the bar was open, and we could be seated immediately, so we snagged a couple stools. We were hungry and wanted to try a couple things. For starters we got the cheese curds and the fries and gravy. The curds were ok, I would have liked a crunchier batter on them, but they were seasoned very well. the Fries and gravy were the show stopper of the appetizers! herbed parsnips and potato's, Gruyere cheese and THE MOST heavenly mushroom gravy. Seriously soooooo good! Next up were the shrimp po'boys. They are served on freaken popovers!!!! These little gems were mouth watering! And I really don't eat a whole lot of shrimp, but damn! Last was the main event. Citrus brined fried chicken and white cheddar cheese waffles! GOOD LORD!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I cant stop thinking about that meal! We had a couple glasses of wine and some of that house made ginger ale, phenominal!The bartender/our waitress was soooo friendly, loved her! The atmosphere was pretty chill. The location is kinda ghetto...not the building, its beautiful, but its in a neighborhood that's a touch iffy, but whatev, I'll go anywhere for great food! Oh yeah, and I forgot to mention, they bring a little ball of cookie dough out as a bite of dessert, FOR FREE! Just the right amount after the feast we had! We will for sure be going back, hopefully the bar will be open, because they were quoting people 45 minute waits all night long and I am sooo not down for that kind of wait.This place has the MOST comfortable comfort food I have ever tried.... My night ended in a food coma. So there.We walked in and were seated right away. I love the feel of this place. Warm, welcome, quirky, and just the kind of place I really enjoy. I notice a few large windows near a sofa. Sparce soft lighting. Different wooden tables. A strip of wood panels on the ceiling. Plenty of bar seating.  Art on the walls. What more can a girl like me ask for?Food, that's what. Oh and a beverage!David approached our table to tell us about the drink specials and then gave us a few minutes to decide. We decided on a couple dark and stormies.... Best I've ever had. Really.We placed our order for food and just to have it come out as it was ready. First came the cheese curds. My favorite bar food. Lightly beer battered, seasoned to perfection and delicious!  Next came the mac and cheese. Saucy, creamy, rich and well seasoned. Covered in proscutto, bread crumbs, and lobstah! I have a weakness for really good mac and cheese. This one is way, way up there. Then our chicken and waffles came out! Three crispy pieces of fried chicken perfectly scortched and well seasoned greenbeans and a huge sweet, flaky waffle smothered in butter. Finally it was desert time. David told us that the deserts change every few weeks and named what was available. We chose the Brazilian banana bread pudding. This desert was perfect. My friend and I shared these plates. Don't try to conquer all of them on your own. You will really end up in a real food coma. So. Much. Good. Food. I might still be in said food coma...Xx,ReesieMeh...  I've had better.  The decor was pleasant and trendy, and the waitresses seemed very friendly (well except for the guy who sat us, he looked like he really didn't give a crap if we were there or not), but the food was just meh...  I had the lemonade and it was a perplexing mixture of not enough lemon or sweetener.  It tasted so watered down that I wasn't even sure it was lemonade, and the sweetness was just barely there.  I even asked the waitress what it was to confirm that I actually received the lemonade.  (Everyone is raving about it here though, so I must've had a VERY bad batch... ?)We shared some cheese curds and they were very tasty.  Horribly greasy, but quite tasty.I got the lobster mac and cheese.  My macaroni noodles were mushy, the cheese was too greasy (puddle at the bottom of the bowl) and salty, the lobster was overcooked and chewy and the whole bowl was boiling hot; a tell tale sign it had either been under a heat lamp or microwaved.  Not exactly the wonderfulness on a fork that I envisioned.My husband got the meatloaf that was on special that night.  The red sauce that it was swimming in was very spicy in an acidic way (which is not a good thing) and the acidic nature of the red sauce clashed badly with the more muted, cheesy scalloped potatoes that accompanied the meatloaf.Overall this as a pretty weak (and expensive) experience at a restaurant that I had MUCH higher hopes for.   I'll try it one more time to be fair and then I'll decide for good if I just hit it on a bad night, or if it's just a case of 'average food in a trendy setting, being over hyped by soulless hipsters who (in a bitter twist of irony) have almost NO taste of their own'...  Probably the case.So we came here for dinner and I started off with their Pinot Noir of course which was quite tasty... For our meal we ordered the Mac and cheese with lobster as well as the rib eye. The Mac and cheese was very creamy and delicious. It had a bit of a kick to it. The ribs were superrrrrr tender. Minus one star for the fact that its hard to locate. There's no huge sign or anything so its easy to miss. Its a really cute place for dinner or a date.So glad I finally got to try Tuck Shop and with two of my favorite Yelpers too boot!  Once I finally figured out where it was, I loved the warm and cozy feel.  Equally appropriate for date night or girls night.  Don't tell my husband, but girls night is usually more fun--they like WINE!!  And sharing means sharing, not I get one bite before it's gone.We had a few small plates, and none disappointed.  I was surprised to find myself loving the arancini, but it's amazing what these folks can do to rice.  And the stuffed dates with chorizo and gruyere?  That's sweet, spicy, creamy, and salty all rolled into one exceptional bite.  Also on the menu, mac 'n cheese for Shannon M (as if I didn't partake in this mini masterpiece) and a juicy steak with mushrooms and creamy mashed potatoes.   Deciding to  watch our calories, we shared only two desserts..pear upside down cake and a brownie.  I would say both were "edible."  And no need to even wash the plates. So, yep, I'm a fan.  A big one!I'm sure the food is great, I'm sure the service is great. Why the one-star review? They didn't have a highchair. I'm sorry if this comes across as entitled, but I didn't see a big sign on the door saying children not welcome, but by choosing not to purchase a $50 highchair, that's exactly what you're saying.We planned to have dinner with our well behaved, non-vomiting, non-screaming one-year-old, but by sending that very clear message that we are not welcome, guess what, we left and went somewhere else.
noca=Being a (closet) fan of Jaimee Rose's  Azcentral blog, I had heard about Noca a few weeks ago. I always enjoy trying out new restaurants and admit to still being very unfamiliar with many of the well known establishments here in the Valley.Trusting her taste and the pictures and descriptions of the items, I was keen on going and what better a time than my birthday. We were a party of 5 and had the following:Parents: Kampachi and a suggestion from the waiter not on the menu but very tasty (linguini with shrimp).Girlfriend: PappardelleSister: DuckMyself: Spinach mezzalunaI have to commend our waiter. Very friendly but not overbearing. She was very familiar with the menu and was able to recommend some wines, which is usually something I don't do but felt comfortable doing with her. She was able to answer all our questions regarding some of the dishes we were unfamiliar with as well.Positives: Very class cozy ambiance. Restaurant was smaller and not exactly what I thought it would be with the "bigger is better" mentality I'm used to in the US but that takes nothing away from it on the contrary.Service is excellent for the most part. Never had to ask for water and the bussers and waiters always seem to have the right timing to refill your water or assist you. The quality of the food was exceptional, though the 1 star penalty goes towards the portions or "bang for your buck". I'd have wished for a few more mezzaluna's and other than my girlfriend's reasonable portion they did seem to be a bit too "european" even for my taste.The desserts really were the cherry on the cake. Perfect portions, very creative and tasty. You actually receive cotton candy at the end of your meal (regardless of a dessert or not I'm can't be sure). I really enjoyed the milk and cookies (excellent chocolate chip cookies provided with a cup of delicious vanilla milkshake). We also enjoyed the cheesecake dessert which consisted of rolled balls of cheesecake with a strawberry coulis and the small doughnuts with jelly were delicious as well. The best part was not footing the bill!Negatives (few but could use some improving):The delay between our order and receiving our food was probably 10-15 minutes. I'm used to having some bread in restaurants that I would consider "classy" or expensive and that was lacking here. They did provide an "amuse bouche" that was original but for some could be considered a bit odd. It consisted of a spoon of mint,melon and pop rocks, quite the party in your mouth and refreshing but not very filling for the wait.I definitely look forward to returning and trying out some of their other dishes. The desserts were exceptional and I'm quite certain a few clients came in just for those, similar to what I do with out of town visitors at Oregano's. All in all a pleasant and welcome surprise to the dining scene here in the valley.Wow.  It's really intimidating to try to write a review of Noca.  Honestly, it was a culinary experience that I find hard, even now (after some scribbling of notes) to sum up effectively in words.  It was wonderful, unquestionably 5 stars.  I'd recommend it to even my most picky friends, were they in the Phoenix area. But how do I explain just *how* enjoyable my food was here? I think that the best I can do is be extremely descriptive:Now, a disclaimer: I came here with other dining companions, so not everything I sampled did I eat all by myself.  I am neither that gluttonous, nor that flush in the pocketbook!  But, I truly did enjoy every bite. Started off with a nice, dry Anselmi Pinot Grigio, and a tempting little morsel that combined mushrooms with a light, flaky pastry. I sampled the spinach mezzaluna. It's silky ricotta melted on the tongue. For my main course, I selected Alaskan halibut. This was some of the best fish I've had.  The flavor of the fish came through, but I think the beurre rouge wasreally what accounted for that flavor -- while a cinnamon froth added just a slight kiss of sweetness.  The halibut was served with baby fennel and onions in a salsify tart.  The tart crust was wonderfully soft and flaky.For dessert, we indulged: The first thing that came seems to be a fun sort of Noca signature -- a large cloud of ultra-fresh cotton candy. We each grasped a nibble or two, but couldn't resist some of the other items on the dessert menu.The apple risotto is not risotto *with apples*. Instead, diced apples are cooked in a way that resembles the cooking of risotto.  A dollop of salt and butter ice cream (!) on top balances out the sweetness just right.  We also shared an order of doughnut holes -- cinnamon and sugar with a slightly crispy outside.  Three accompanying dipping sauces added a little extra to our sugar buzz -- my favorite was the dulce de leche. All throughout dinner, the restaurant was extremely busy (particularly for a weeknight), but our server didn't skip a beat.  Owner Elliot was making the rounds, telling us more about the restaurant and making recommendations. It's obvious that his heart is in this restaurant completely, and it show (and tastes) accordingly!Let me preface this by saying 5 stars do not give this foodie haven justice... this is probably the most delicious meal I've had... EVER!It was a Wednesday night and we had 8:00 reservations.  We walked in right on time and were greeted immediately by none other than Eliot Wexler, himself. He couldn't have been friendlier, seating us immediately (just the way it should be when you have a reservation)! I noticed that the restaurant was packed and everyone around us seemed to be enjoying themselves - that was a good sign!  Plus the fact that I bumped into Jenn H, and I know she's got good taste, so when she recommended a few of her favorite menu items, I listened!There were 3 of us dining, and I know we all enjoyed every moment, every sip, and every bite!  We each had a glass of wine to start - I went with the Kim Crawford Sauv Blanc.  Looking over the menu, it was difficult to decide on what to order - everything sounded unique and appealing.  After asking our waiter, Robert, for his opinion, I flagged Eliot down to ask what he thought between the Skate Wing and the Scallops.  He sold me on the Skate Wing... and I would order it again and again!  But before I get there, I have to mention that the table sampled the Gougere with mushroom duxelle and port wine syrup... (a special treat that was not on the menu).  We also tasted the Spinach Mezzaluna - a handmade ravioli stuffed with ricotta, mascarpone, and pecorino.  It was incredible!  I truly savored each bite! Oh, and how can I forget the fresh bread and olive oil brought to our table?  Truly, the freshest tasting olive oil... I'm not kidding!On to the entrees... (pictured above).  My companions fancied their scallops and halibut immensely.  We traded a bite for a bite so we could each try all three entrees too, and they were all pretty amazing.  I will say, however, that Eliot (and Jenn H) steered me right in suggesting the Skate Wing.  I pretty much licked my plate clean!We were all full after the entrees but decided that dessert would be a good ending to this phenomenal meal... so, what did we do?  On top of the cotton candy, we shared the donuts and the apple risotto.  We may as well do it right, right?  Wow!  We sure did do it right... the donut holes were served with 3 dipping sauces, and while I'm not a donut person, these were pretty amazing.  I hadn't treated myself to Cotton Candy since I was a little girl, so that was a fun addition of sugar shot right into my system... you have to have some, it's their signature dessert!  Finally, we went for one more indulgence... the apple risotto - oh, the apple risotto.  Fantastic!  Tiny pieces of apple sauteed with butter, sugar, honey, and more... topped with a salty butter flavored ice cream.  I know there were some additional ingredients that I'm missing here, but OMG... need I say more?In some of the press I've read about this place, it's referred to as "fine dining in a casual atmosphere at an accessible price." I would agree with that - although I do think the 'accessible price' part is relative.  I would consider this more of a 'special occasion' type of place because of the $$ you'll spend here - $50 pp more or less.  It's worth dumping out your piggy bank if you have to though... it's a culinary experience you won't forget!I'm already dreaming about my next visit!I've been putting off writing this review for a few weeks. I'm very torn on NOCA because I wanted it to be a 5 star experience, but it just wasn't. While it was very good in some aspects there were places where it fell short. I just can't sit here and say that this was the best dining experience of my life, in all honestly I'm not sure it cracks top 10. I found the dishes that I sampled to be hit or miss. I chose to not order an appetizer because my duck allergy prevented me from ordering 4/6 that are offered and I don't like beets. Which is not the fault of NOCA, but really left me with the green salad so I decided to forgo the appetizer entirely. We were presented with two chef's tastings. The first, Gougere with mushroom duxelle and port wine syrup, did not impress me, the pastry was entirely too hard and the plating was awkward. The second, Spinach Mezzaluna , which is essentially a ravioli, was absolutely divine. They ran out of several menu items before we could even order. Once our entrees arrived I found my scallops to be very good, but not perfect. Some were gritty and they still had a chewiness factor to them, not a melting factor. I do think they may have been the best I've had in Arizona, but not the best I've had in my life and not nearly as good as the ones I had enjoyed at SW in Vegas the previous week. The butternut squash gnocchi that they were served with didn't taste like gnocchi at all, but rather tasted like butternut squash balls. I sampled my companion's dishes and thought the skate was very good but I found the halibut to be dry. In addition to the cotton candy they give everyone we tried two desserts which were good. (We were also given a cookie to take home). My dining partners enjoyed the apple risotto dish we shared, however, I think the poached apple at Sol y Sombra is much better. I did think the doughnuts were well done, I've been running into a lot of bad doughnuts in restaurants lately so I was pleasantly surprised by them. The service was fantastic, although I found it amusing when our server explained to us what day boat scallops are....not just because I know what they are but, um, where are those day boats docking here in Phoenix? Elliot, the owner, was incredibly nice and kept coming over to talk to us. It is clear he is passionate about the restaurant. But for me it was lacking in that extra something. Its not a romantic place. Its loud. I think it would be great for friends. It kind of reminded me of one of my favorite places in Boston, Union, except the finishing touches weren't there. The mirrors on the walls didn't have frames, the leather booths did not look like the kind that should be in a restaurant of this caliber, the bar is in an awkward spot, the patio seating is directly on the sidewalk of the strip mall. Which may seem trite but for $3O an entree these little details should be considered. Unfortunately I am falling into that "in Phoenix this is good, but in Boston or NY it wouldn't be as good" situation, which is one that I absolutely hate to be in. I think NOCA could be great and there is a definite lack of a restaurant like this in Phoenix but for me it wasn't quite there. I've definitely had better food and enjoyed better atmospheres. I do plan on returning for one of their Simple Suppers to try them out again.I am in love! Oohhh, sorry not with you...but with NOCA! I cannot believe I have not been here sooner. I guess you find love when you least expect it. Since dinner here, I have not stopped thinking and fantasizing about this place. I knew it was going to be a great time when the charming guy at the door greeted us. We were seated promptly at a great table in the back.The chardonnay I ordered was one I have never tried, now its my new fav. I tried to make a point to remember the name of it but now I forget..I loved the little spoonful of Gorgonzola cheese mousse with the organic date. It was a tasty tease of what was to come. I had the lobster roll, which was the most divine thing that has crossed these lips in awhile. It was so full of flavor....limey, creamy, lobstery..yum! I could of done with out the fries, but they were as good as a fry can be covered in aioli dip. Usually I don't do dessert, especially on the first visit but one look at the menu and I had to have something! I chose the milk and cookies, which sounded fun. And fun and delish it was! The cookies were almost like cake and I enjoyed dipping them into every last drop of the milkshake. Its the desert that I am definitely still thinking about. The cotton candy that they brought out at the end was a really cute touch I thought. I thought that was the end after 2 rounds of dessert but no...they had to really top it of with the chocolate chip shortbread to bring home! What restaurant does that?! Who doesn't like a tasty treat to bring home? So that basically put me over the edge and I had to proclaim my love. Too bad I'm moving out of state....but maybe it's a good thing because I am sure this love affair would cause my waist line to expand.I stumbled on to a gem! I was walking out of Safeway realizing we were not going to make it to the movies on time if we took our chances at Giuseppe's when I glanced over and saw Noca. Strip Mall location and all we decided to give it a try.  The place was packed so we took a seat at the bar and our server/bartender was very and attentive and amusing.This place is amazing! It is small, but has a great layout and an open kitchen full of activity. The food was basic and delicious, I had a pasta dish with sausage and herb butter. Simple but prepared well with exceptional quality ingredients that you could taste at first bite.The owner Eliot Wexler sat us and came by to check on us, another example of excellent service.The meal ended with cotton candy, quite a sweet surprise for our first visit. And it rounded out the meal nicely. I was a bit disappointed with the desert menu.. donuts and cookies? I think they could get a bit more creative.  Either way this was truly a 5 star delicious dining experience.Two things really struck me about this place:  the tasting menu portions are HUGE and the restaurant has an extraordinarily convivial, let's-mingle-amongst-foodie-friends atmosphere.  Since we only spent two nights in Phoenix, I did my research and made sure that one day was devoted to the awesomeness that is Chris Bianco and the second night would be at a delicious, more upscale restaurant that takes reservations.  After searching Chowhound and Yelp, we decided on NOCA.  I knew ahead of time that NOCA doesn't normally offer a tasting menu (which is how I like to roll when I am trying out a new place) but on the day we were visiting, there was a special Four Peaks Brewery beer pairing tasting menu.  I'm not a huge fan of beer (plus I'm one of those unfortunate Asians missing that essential enzyme that breaks down alcohol), so I wasn't psyched about the pairing, but I'm super glad I got the tasting menu because there was a whole lot of yummy-ness served up that night.Here's what we had for $85/person:* Amuse of shredded duck salad with tangy Asian vinaigrette* Fluke sashimi with pickled radish, rice crunchies, ponzu gelee (with Sunbru Kolsch Style Ale)* "Bacon and Eggs" pork belly with onion jam, crispy poached organic egg, Blis maple syrup (with Hefeweizen)* Wagyu Pastrami and pickled cabbage and red onion on pumpernickel toast with Dijon foam (with Hop Knot IPA).* Alaskan King salmon with melted baby leeks, asparagus, morels, and Bearnaise sauce (with The Raj India Pale Ale)* Berkshire Pork Loin with mustard spaetzle, carmelized napa cabbage, baby carrots, and smoked shallot jus (with Kiltlifter Scottish-Style Ale)* Big bowl of blue raspberry cotton candy* Oatmeal Stout Float with malted vanilla ice cream, warm doughnuts, and dulce de leche dipping sauce (with Oatmeal stout).Everything was really delicious but super filling.  I swear I reached maximum capacity by the time I ate the Wagyu pastrami (our 3rd course!).  We even had our waiter start giving us just one glass of beer to share because we were just wasting it.  Per our waiter, the portions weren't much smaller than the regular (non-tasting-menu) sizes even though we were eating five meat-heavy courses plus dessert.  I know the Asian in me should have relished the bang-for-the-buck, but I really wish the portions were smaller so I could have savored it more (my genetic make-up renders me unable to leave food on the plate without major guilt).  My faves were the "Bacon and Eggs" - melt in your mouth savory pork belly goodness paired with the subtle sweetness of maple syrup and Wagyu Pastrami.Service was a little harried when we first sat down because the kitchen was slammed by the large number of people unexpectedly ordering the tasting menu but overall, we had a great time.  We spent the evening comparing notes with our neighbors at adjoining tables about which dishes we liked the best and commiserating about how full our bellies were getting.  I left looking like I was pregnant again, no joke.Noca, Noca, Noca...I've been wanting to try you for a while..but with child in tow..I was sceptical about trying you out....do I heart you to death right now? yes! K...so, let's rock the nitty gritty...I ate there a few hours ago and HAD to share... When I walked in, they totally didn't even bat an eye that my daughter(8) was with me...patrons however gave me "the look"...little did they know she was totally in the kitchen later with the chef makin their little cloud of heaven... Ok..so the most phenom wait / bus staff ever! EVER!!!! I applaud you!! If I could have raised a glass to all of you and thought the some what persnickety crowd would follow I would have. But , you know the "Arcadia crowd"... God forbid..they acknowledge where they came from and may be again ...anyway..hat's off to the training and ridiculous management skills you have developed! Like I always tell anyone I have ever dated...it's the small things that count ( d--- exclude) and attention to detail ...NOCA covers it all.... the teeny mad hatter tea cups with soup and the perfect olive oil dipping trays.. I don't heart much these days....serious..check this sh-- out..fo real! If I could put up with the dbag letch next to me for this....you know ..;or please know,..NOCA deserves a visit. The kitchen was a tad slow, but they were slammed all at once..and it's actually nice to have a slow meal, and give each coarse the attention it deserves...they made up for the wait, by bringing Little Tea Cup's of Pea Soup, and Corn Soup, which I snagged from my daughter...then a bowl of tomato gazpacho..(which I couldn't eat, as I am allergic to tomatoes), the waitress did not bat an eye..she whisked it away...and replaced it with an asparagus toasted pine nut salad..yummy! (All of this was complimentary).. I had an Ultimate Vodka Martini..fabu! Nice, Cozy  little 6 seat bar..if the dining room looks crowded, look a little further back to your left and see if you can squeeze in there..good seats and a bird eye view of the crowd.k...so..the lobster ( pronounced) LOBSTAAAAA roll only on Wed. ..I was all trying to be healthy and not eat as a sandwich, at 1st...and it was ok...then I picked it up and had the whole enchilada ....f--- me all the way to heaven and back...you have no idea...I thought about not telling you for like 2 point 4 seconds flat..then decided if you want to have the big "O"..get off your ass and go....just stuff the big ass delight in your face..boss, date, Mom, lookin at you...doesn't matter ..you will thank me later. I have had to cut a lot of food out of my life lately...but NOCA was like ...whatever..bring it on bitch...Thank you for rockin my pallet tonight! The chef...so inventive on every level....the food speaks volumes... but what rocked me was the manager asking my daughter to meet the chef and go in the kitchen to help make the little puffs of heaven .... wait for it....wait for it....home made right then and there-COTTON CANDY! My all time favorite childhood treat. I renamed them Rockin Heaven Puff's last night. They bring them out after your meal....and they'll bring you 2..not that I would know... or anyone else they were gone so fast..I think I licked the bowl...oh geez, do over.NOCA....you are the date I dream about! If yelp had an "O" rating ...you would have it tonight!I've now been twice. Once as a business dinner, once as an intimate dinner. Both times had their good things and their so-so things. The first time I went, they already had 4 things 86'd off the menu at 7pm. And since they had a slimmer, summer menu in place, it made it even narrower of a selection. I did have fresh softshell crab for app that go around with scallops for entree. The scallops were over cooked and the accompanying risotto was under cooked. The most recent dining experience there I had pork belly as app and lamb loin for entree. The pork was delicious and the lamb was good, but the spinach and baby carrot coins that came with were oversalted. Desserts were pretty good both times I went. Of course everyone marvels at the cotton candy as well as the take-home cookie. All and all, if this place didn't price gouge the shit out of you, I'd might come back. But after spending $200 on a mediocre dinner, I am not likely to return on my own accord.So a Redneck walks into a fancy restaurant...We were immediately greeted when we walked into the restaurant and asked if we had reservations...On a Wednesday night...in Phoenix...during the summer...and the restaurant is only half full.  Are you kidding me?  We were promptly seated and briefly waited for a waitress to bring us our menus.  The whole reason we came to Noca was for the lobster roll, so the menus weren't really necessary.  We usually make an annual trip to Maine every summer to visit family but this year, things didn't work out.  So we thought we'd bring a little bit of Maine to us.  Looking at the menu, it was pretty light, but it's summer and I knew what I wanted, so no biggie.Just for grins I started reading through the few things on the menu and about choked on my water when I saw the lobster roll.  $30 for a lobster roll?  This better be one helluva lobster roll for $30.  The best lobster roll in Maine will set you back $6 in a little town called Wells, and the average price back there is $8-12 in any restaurant.  So I read on..."Organic Chicken Egg"...on a biscuit...with a slice of bacon...and a slice of tomato... $15.  At this point, I'm literally laughing out loud.  The waitress returned for our drink order and I was good with the water but my wife ordered a glass of wine.  The waitress later returned and apologized for the fact that they were out of the wine my wife had selected.  So my wife ordered a Riesling and we placed our order.  A few minutes later, another waitress brought us "Tonight's salad...a chopped cucumber and red bell pepper medley".  Okay...You know when you go to a Chinese food restaurant and order a cup of wonton soup and they bring it in that little bowl with the funny lookin' spoon?  Well, the salad was served on one of those funny lookin' spoons.   I kid you not, the "salad" was about a teaspoon full of chopped cucumbers and red bell peppers.  Was it good?  I can't be sure.  I guess I need more than one bite to tell.  While we were enjoying our "salad" a party of four was seated next to us.  This restaurant is another one of those "let's see how many tables we can pack in this place and encroach on everyone's personal space" types.  I swear I've seen cattle in a feed lot with more room to masticate.  The party of four talked it over and ended up ordering a medley of things to share.  One person ordered the lobster roll and the guy sitting next to me ordered...you guessed it...The Chicken Egg!Now I don't know about any of you that might be reading this, but I grew up with livestock.  We raised chickens and every morning I had to gather the eggs.  Now anyone that's ever tried to gather eggs out from under a nesting hen knows it isn't fun.  In fact, it ranks right up there with having to clean out the livestock pens at the county fair as part of your community service.  Thinking back, it probably wasn't a good idea to write "Will you go to the prom with me?" on Jenny Martin's front yard with gasoline when I was in high school.   How was I supposed to know her uncle was the county judge?  Okay, I may or may not have made that part up.  But still, that was the late 80's and I used to sell my eggs for $2 a dozen to different folks around town.  Talk about inflation!So our lobster rolls arrive and we dig in. Now let me just tell you, these lobster rolls were about half the size of an average lobster roll in Maine.  The portion sizes here were really starting to annoy me.   I have to say that I'm not a fan of pommes fries fried in duck fat either.  I guess I'm a purist.  The foursome sitting next to us started to literally, "Oooo and Ahhhh" over our dinner.  So much so, that I almost offered the guy a bite.  But then his chicken egg showed up and I didn't have to...Sucker!After our dinner the waitress brought us the dessert menu.  We looked it over but were pretty full so we decided to pass.  So when she returned with the bill she brought us a bowl with freshly made cotton candy.  Now we're talkin'!  We paid our bill; $80 for 2 lobster rolls, a glass of wine, and a bottle of water and then left.  Who's the sucker again?  Half way out of the parking lot the salad waitress came running out the door and yelled, "Thank you!  Please come again!"  I'm giving Noca 3 out of 5 stars, but it will probably go on my "Been there, done that" list, just because it wasn't my kind of place.   I have to say the food was good, but ridiculously overpriced.  The service was spot on and not overly intrusive.  The only thing that would have made it better for me, and perhaps earned them one more star would have been if they would have given us a bag so we could take our cotton candy home...But then again I don't really need any more reminders of the County Fair.I hope this review came across as more comical and not snarky.  I didn't want it to appear snarky.  Please give the place a try for yourself.  It is very nice.  And by the way, my wife LOVED it!Completely. Totally. Utterly - UN-impressed. I am not going to bother to nit-pick my lame experience through 5 'courses' (yes, 1 of them on a tiny spoon - maybe we took Thumbelina's table).  Salad: "OK"Steak: CHEWY (spat out several pieces - gross, i know)(with hash browns for DINNER?!?!)sourdough bread served with olive Oil (!?!) combined taste = acidicsmurf blue cotton candy  (WTH?!?!)1 star for a yummy dessert - but by then i was pissed off, so it only counts to actually write and insert this reveiw!ended up a pissy nite with us blaming each other who's stupid idea it was to choice to waste our nite (and MOOLA !!) here.What a lovely dinner at NOCA , not only is the food really tasty and fresh but the service is wonderful .  I am overall impressed with the smoothness and finesse of the staff. We noticed that without being intrusive or cloying the staff seemed to notice and respond to our needs. I was amazed how each staff member was responsible for different elements of the serving. One person brought the amuse bouche , a different person refilled water, a different person brought cotton candy ( yes cotton candy, it works) waiter took order and oversaw our dinner, host responded to request , ended meal and smoothly transitioned our exit,  well done . The food was really good , the amuse bouche was.. should we say ...amusing.  so much so that we had to ask again to find our what is was...watermelon and radish "something"..and it worked. We ordered the Tartar which was my favorite for the evening ,  a lovely nibble of handsomely seasoned raw tuna , capers added to the taste with toast rubbed with truffle oil I believe.. super. Salad was the low point, if you can say that , heirloom tomatoes with a light oil and seasoning,  salad with ummm something unremarkable. My entree was a skirt steak very tasty and a potato cake reminiscent of a hash brown but much better.  I had to dodge the spinach ..but husband said it was great. Plus 1 had the Halibut with a yummy sauce that was good yet I could quite place the reddish seasonings..I love a challenge.. he also had rosti potatoes , one of our favorites. Raspberry cotton candy swirled into a light cylinder shape came to our table like a blue  cloud of "ta-da" to finish the meal.  We didn't eat  it but it sure looked pretty. I was fascinated by dessert, a mango thin pudding , with coconut sorbet topped with a thin cracker of hardened meringue ..it looks childish at first, my first thought , I am so going to get Gelato after... but then you eat them spooned together and it's this lovely taste sensation , very delicate and symbiotic.. who would have thought it? I really was impressed if you can't tell. I definitely will be back . Can't wait to try a Sunday Supper!I had been wanting to try NOCA since it opened, and we finally made it to a Simple Sunday Supper recently. We certainly don't mind spending $100+ on a good dinner, but this was not it. Hubby got the vegetarian option- beet manicotti. It was better than he expected it to be, but by comparison to the size of my meal, his portion was quite small. I got the fried chicken and wondered who the hell had named it the best in the valley when I was sitting there wishing I had a plate of Lo-Los'. I thought the breading was way too thick and doughy and didn't care for the marinade. The corn on the cob as well cooked, but nothing special. The potato salad was average at best, and the biscuit was fine. The stand-out was the supplement of pork and beans. The flavor was outstanding, but the beans were a tad al-dente. Hubby didn't particularly care for his wine.Now, I love sweets, but dessert was overkill. The best thing was the cotton candy. Our sundaes were completely soupy, and then we got handed an average chocolate chip shortbread to take home.I found the service to be overkill as well. I mean, I can pour my own beer, for heaven's sake. The wait staff was always hovering. What we didn't get, however, was a visit from the owner, who seemed to stop by every other table in the restaurant. Maybe he could tell we were disappointed, and just didn't want to hear it.I have been wanting to try Noca for quite a while now, so when they had a Groupon a few weeks ago I bought one & decided this would be our Valentine's day date destination. I made reservations for Saturday the 12th at 8:30pm. We were about 15 minuets late, but the hostess was very gracious & seated us immediately. We were sat at a high top table with a chair on 1 side & a booth on the other. There wasn't much going on with the design of the restaurant, but I did like the mirrors across from us & the lighting fixtures. I also liked the faucets in the bathrooms. For starters we ordered the mussels, our server said it was more of a one person dish so we each got our own. They were delicious & he was right, we both finished ours. I ordered the nocarita to sip on & my husband surprisingly opted for a sprite. My cocktail was strong but tasty. Our 1st Amuse Bouche of the night, a bite of what tasted like cucumbers & radish. It was light & refreshing. The server who brought it out did describe it, but it was so loud in there we honestly didn't hear him. Our 2nd was a cute lil teacup of parsnip soup. It was creamy & smooth, I loved it! My hubby wouldn't even try it though, so I gladly had both of ours. I almost forgot to mention the bread & olive oil that came before our app, very basic but very good.About an hour had passed from when we had received our app. I didn't notice the length of time, but my husband made a comment to me about how long we'd been waiting for our entrees. A few minutes later our server came up to us apologizing for the wait. He informed us that dinner was on the house tonight & gave us back our Groupon to use another time. I told him I could see that they were very busy & they didn't have to comp our dinner for us, but he insisted. He then brought out a fresh crab cake of sorts with strawberries & a cilantro drizzle, to nibble on while we waited for our entrees. About 15 minutes later our entrees arrived. My hubby ordered the prime hangar steak & I ordered the striped bass. Both were superb but I think I had the winner. We were already pretty full from all the previously mentioned food we ate, so we took a majority of our entrees to go. I was going to skip dessert since I was already stuffed & I knew we'd be getting some cotton candy, but our server convinced me & I got the doughnuts to go. They were pretty good & I loved the dipping sauces. The cotton candy was a blue-raspberry flavor & my husband loved it, such a fun, sweet end to our meal. Oh & they also handed out tiny shortbread cookies, which were buttery & slightly crunchy, yum! If our meal hadn't been taken care of, the total would have been about $111. Service throughout our meal was outstanding, I don't think our water glasses were ever less than half full. We left our server a tip that was probably more than most would have left, but he was great & it wasn't his fault our meal tickets were misplaced. I can't wait to return with my Groupon for another amazing meal, well done Noca!I had heard very good things about Noca, and was sadly let down.  The food was ok, but very overpriced.  The mussels were tasty, everything else was sub par.  The kicker for the night is we had a question for the manager about our bill and apparently it was a bad day for him and we were practically escorted out of the restaurant.  I dine out several times a week and have never been treated so badly.  Needless to say I will not be heading back to Noca nor recommending to any friends of mine.  What a shame.  I love trying new food in Phoenix and loved the atmosphere, but a bad attitude from management and overpriced food will keep me from coming back.I made my reservation so I could use my groupon before moving out of town... not realizing it was the middle of restaurant week.  This was a minor issue, and will just force a return visit to this fabulous spot (oh darn).  I was a little concerned that restaurant week might not be as stellar as expected, but I honestly can't imagine this meal getting any better.We started with parsnip soup and polenta.  The parsnip soup had a delicious onion undertone, and was quickly slurped up.  The polenta was eaten VERY slowly... so we wouldn't miss a tiny second of savoring the amazingness.  It was THAT good.  The simple topping of crispy capicola and olives, drizzed with olive oil was pure genius.  If it had been an option, I would have forgone the rest of my meal in trade for a large vat of this polenta.   We had the vegetable risotto and salmon with farro next.  The salmon was perfectly done and I really enjoyed the bacon and braised kale that graced the farro.  Our server brought us the standard bowl of cotton candy, which I feel is unnecessarily large.  I mean, I like cotton candy as much as the next person... but about 1/3 of the portion would probably suffice and make the same fun, whimsical statement.  The desserts were next, and were superb.  The brightness of the passion fruit was an amazing ending to an incredible meal.  Our service was impeccable, and I loved the touch of being sent off with a little piece of chocolate-chip shortbread.  Though, sadly, I put the bag in my purse and forgot about it for 2 weeks... I'm not sure if it was any good or not, but the thought was appreciated! This is definitely on my must-recommend list, and I hope I am able to visit again soon.
Shish Kabobs & Gyros=I am backed up on reviewing, frankly.  So this one is a couple months overdue.  I met fellow Yelper Brian S here for lunch.  I ordered the Gyro plate as I wanted some Greek salad with the meal.  Well the plate deals here are huge.  Two people could probably manage just fine sharing one of the plate meals.  Lots of meat, sauce, fries, salad, dressing.I didn't finish and still I had no room for baklava after.  Sad.The decor is pretty basic.  I would class them as a good lunch spot or cheap dinner joint, not in the "Out for a nice meal" class.
Curry Leaf Indian Grill=It's interesting seeing some of the reviews on here. You would think Curry Leaf was trying to present itself as an upscale Indian food restaurant in a hugely desirable area. Curry Leaf shares a strip mall with a dry cleaners, taco bell, AZ Hair Co and Chuck E Cheese. It's a small place with tables to eat in, but I imagine most of their business is takeout or the newly available delivery. Jeff P mentions "It just sees as if some random Auntie and Uncle decided to lease a space and start cooking fast food versions of Indian food" ... first of all, I disagree with this, and second, isn't America founded on the entrepreneurial spirit that promotes local owned businesses?!? Curry Leaf is owned by a husband/wife duo and I was super stoked at how nice the husband was. He answered my questions without prejudice which is rare for me in other Indian establishments. While I waited for my food, we chatted about their business, my business and other random chit chat. As I was leaving, another gentleman came in and the husband sang out "Hey Bob, how are you doing today?!?" It's nice to see that customer service and appreciation are still alive these days. I ordered the Channa Masala bowl with Basmati Rice and a side of Cumin Potatoes and I was really impressed. The flavor in both dishes was great and had just a little tinge of spicyness. The portions were great and for the price of $4.99 I think an excellent value (Lunch price is $4.99; regularly $6.99). There are also a couple of really neat things that make this place stand out: They offer deliver and TEXT IN service... so you can actually text them your order for pickup! I think that is such a cool idea. You are texting directly to the husbands phone, and then he saves your number so that in the future he knows that its you. I'm pretty sure he remembers every customer. The bowls that they use for takeout are very durable and can be used again as Tupperware. I think this is a super cool idea and adds a little value. In a world where we are cattle prodded through life eating out of Styrofoam containers in our cars, I believe Curry Leaf has made an attempt to add value to their product and I for one am both impressed and inspired and look forward to a new weekly lunch spot!
J. Alexander's=J Alexanders has come to town....and its like Santa coming! JA coming with all its goodies! I'm a JA regular in Michigan and I've been at the  doors every week like a bad Mervyns commercial!!! Open! Open! Open! (kidding). They finally opened today I'm told more busy than expected.  J Alexanders serves American-style food with a contemporary twist. They fit somewhere between casual and fine dining and the atmosphere is enhanced by dark woods, indoor/outdoor bar and interesting textures.  For Houstons fans, JA has a strikingly similar atmosphere and menu. Legend has it that the original owners of Houstons split and started JA. I personally like the JA menu better. From the colossal onion rings on the appetizer menu to their always classic and perfectly juicy prime rib.  You may see some similarities to Houstons, but don't expect the "famous" Houston's spinach dip. JA's is a queso dip (w/ a little spinach).  As I understand it, they try to tweak their menu to regional markets. If that's so, they have to add more flavor to the queso dip. It was terribly lacking in flavor. Folks in this region expect their Southwest style dishes be full of flavor! Kick it up a notch! One friend had the blue cheese topped filet Mignon and another the pork loin...both very good. The wine list is reliable and pleasing. Many well known labels integrated with some interesting less known. If you're a lemonade lover (Arnold Palmer for DA kid) try their fresh squeezed. Ah! I tell you....they bust their butts for this simple childhood favorite. If you're a carrot cake fan...you've gotta have it! My friends and I sat at the bar to watch some Monday night football and our servers Chris and Brittany were friendly and attentive. Tell them I said "hello"! Bon Appetite!Sorry Natalie - Although I did enjoy the top secret pimiento cheese spread, and of course the company, I thought that my overall experience was only mediocre for the price... I'd been to J. Alexander's before - I think to one of their Michigan locations.  It didn't make a huge impression then, and it didn't this time either.  I think Houston's food, service, and atmosphere actually blow this place away.  Our server was Justin and he did an ok job.  I went with the cobb salad and ordered a side of their butternut squash for the table to share.  Salad was decent and squash was tasty.  Maybe the way to go is to sit at the bar (or so Natalie says).  I don't see returning anytime soon, but I would if someone twisted my arm.  Although the food was decent, I'd rather spend my time and money elsewhere!  Just meh, mediocre, average, etc...Hit up J Alexander's for lunch today... El Toritio next door is closed by the way (not sure if temporarily for construction in the plaza, or for good).Their menu is impressive for lunch! They offered items like a new york strip, club sandwich, chicken fried chicken, sea bass and diver scallops.The place was fairly empty at noon, and reminded me of a well lit Houston's (but here they let you wear your cap).  I imagine it is beautiful at night.Overall good service, food, atmosphere, and price. I'll go back.In the land overloaded with restaurants, sometimes it takes some time to finally make it to one that's been right under your noise the whole time. For me, this is J Alexanders. I probably visit the Borgata area several times a week; whether it's to grocery shop, get a manicure or have a meal. Yet, I never made it to J Alexanders. I always wanted to try it out, just never got the chance -- until tonight that is. It's the midst of spring training season which means every restaurant, including the less than par ones, are packed to the brim with an hour wait. Luckily for us, tonight we got there just before the tourist crowd and got seated right away in a prime table on the patio. Upon first glance at the menu, I saw that it stocked full of cuisine options -- everything from steak to sandwiches to plenty of seafood choices. We started with the Spanish spinach dip and some local brew from Four Peaks. For my entree, I decided to go with the chicken sandwich and couscous on the side. The chicken sandwich tasted exactly like the Biltmore chicken sandwich from Houston's. That's not necessarily a bad thing since I like the sandwich, but it was interesting to taste such a strong resemblance. The couscous was really delicious and they did an excellent job of blending the spices and dressing up what could have been a boring side. All in all, this is a decent recent and a solid choice for a restaurant meal at a decent meal price.Met a colleague for lunch here the other day.  Decided to order the Club Sandwich w/Fries, $11.  He warned me that they don't mess around with their portion size....he was right.  This Sandwich was huge!  In addition to that, it comes with a large pile of skinny Fries.  The Club Sandwich was very good.....and the Fries were outstanding.  I could eat a large plate of those Fries.The service was great as well.  Overall, a pleasant "working" lunch experience.Return Factor - 90%
Rosati's=23 years ago this Memorial Day Weekend I rolled into Las Vegas from residing downtown Chicago. I got tired of the city...all the glass, concrete, steel, sirens, horns, people, people, people, waiting in lines, 20 below zero brutal winters, 100% humid summers, Lake Michigan dumping snow/sleet/hail, etc., etc. But one thing I never got sick of was the restaurants, specifically the pizza category.  Chicago Style Pizza is a unique deep dish pie designed to be eaten with a fork and knife after it bakes a good 30+ minutes.  Worth the wait tonight at Rosati's on N. Durango and Grand Teton.Delicious pizza and Greek salad, friendly service, non-smoking atmosphere, plenty of TVs to watch the games, and large booths...I look forward to dining here again when i'm up in this area of the valley!
Saffron Indian Cuisine=Let me preface this by saying that as an Indian-American, from New Jersey of all places, I have relatively high standards for Indian cuisine. With that said, I would give Saffron's food a 3.5 rating. However, their dreadful service (note other reviews) brings that down to about a 2-star. It is amazing how lousy the service could be even while the restaurant is half-full. I would stick to buffet here, considering even asking for onions/jalapenos (a common complimentary add-on from Indian restaurants) would run you an extra $2-3 dollars. Furthermore, the portions are not quite right from the entrees, so buffet is best:Monday - Friday: $8.95 lunch buffetSaturday: $9.95 lunch buffetSunday: $12.95 lunch buffet (includes beverage)Ultimately, this place works if you are really craving Indian, but I have yet to find a consistently fantastic Indian spot in Charlotte. The search continues!!One time we stopped by here after the movies to grab dinner, but they were having a private party and was only placing take out orders to go.Came for dinner here. The food is just right for me. Not crazy about hot and spicy foods. My stomach is not able to handle that much heat.We order an appetizer- the Potali Samosa. The crust is like a fried Cannoli. Really good with the dipping sauce- Mild which was sweet, Med- Green sauce and Hot-Red which I steer far away from.Entrees consisted of Lamb Saag- Creamy spinach with lamb. Also, Lamb Vindaloo- Little tangy spice. They entrees were prepared mild and was just right.Wash it all down with a glass of Pinot Grigio. What a nice way to end the evening. Great place to take a date on, celebrate anniversary or even a girls night out.Will be back again.
Fuel Pizza Cafe=Let's look at the plus column first:Great location near Seventh Street MarketReally cool retro décor with a boldness and "filling station" feel to itDecent pizza that can be ordered by the sliceNow the minus:Took a while for someone to notice me standing at the register$7.50 for two slices was a bit steepThe pizza looked pretty dried out before it was put in the ovenQuite honestly, if Pure Pizza had been open, I would have gone there instead.
Plaka Taverna=Breakfast for two for under $20? Done. In addition to irresistible authentic Greek fare these guys have a solid (more American) brunch situation that was delish.
Kabob Inn=mmmmmm Kabob.I enjoyed this place and will go back, perhaps today.  They serve Lebanese style meats with rice and pita.  They've got a great lunch special which comes with 4 different types of meat, rice, salad and pita for like $6.50!  Everything was very tasty and seemed fresh.  My only complaint was some of the meats were a little bland, but not too bad, I just like a LOT of flavor.
Roast Beef and Rye Delicatessen=First visit was great.  One of the better Italian subs I have had.  Went two more times and portions were scaled back to anorexic levels.First visit the guys behind the counter were super friendly.  Next two times bordering on rude.  Our business had planned to use them exclusively to feed our trainees...not gonna happen.Good location,. good quality ingredients.  Poor value and service.  Put a smile on everyone's face and you can afford to build a better sandwich...more people will come in.  Having a bunch of angry people behind the counter is a killer.Too bad, I really liked this place the first time.
LBS Burger=@LBSBURGER at Red Rock Casino #Vegas #nom good!!!With the Saloon style atmosphere and casual dress its a VERY cool Vibe just missing the peanut shells on the floor and the Live band!!My waiter looked like Seth Rogen!! The Service was outstanding-fast & friendly with flair:) The food was Great too. I ordered a Burger and some Potato Twists as you can see from the Photos  it was OUTSTANDING!! One of the BEST tasting burgers I have had and well worth the drive + price tag plus if your up for a challenge they have ONE of the BIGGEST and BADDEST in Town. I had the  STEAKHOUSE BURGER $13.00PEPPERCORN CRUSTED BEEF + GRILLED WILD MUSHROOMSWISS CHEESE + OVEN ROASTED TOMATO + MIX GREENSRED ONION MARMALADE + HORSERADISH-STEAK SAUCE#nom #soGoodWhere do I start?First of all I've waited over a week for LBS Burger to get back to me on this issue to fairly give them to resolve this issue but I have heard nothing.  They have no email on their website and the phone number that they have to reach them is always busy.  I contacted then on facebook and got an acknowledgement that it would be forwarded on, but never heard back.   We wanted to make sure that the issue, a person, was gone so we could maybe come back sometime as regular patrons.  Now I am leaving my honest review of actual events that occurred during our last visit.   I am leaving names out of this review.First of all, our family used to absolutely love this place.  Usually LBS Burger is a place where my family went and we always had good service and food.  However, last time we visited was far from what we expected.We arrived at LBS Burger at 8:35pm to celebrate a special occasion.  We were promptly seated at approximately 8:40pm in the back of the restaurant.  It was a party of 5, with two adults and three children.  Our first encounter with our server - bald young adult with black earlobe rings (who was later identified by the General Manager) was less than pleasant off the bat.  He greeted us with a non-energetic and non-professional and "What's up?" for our drink orders.  We brushed it off.We ordered a water, a diet coke and three root beers for our children.  A few minutes later, our food order was taken.  We proceeded to receive our drinks and eat our appetizers: potato twisters and fried cheese curds.  We had requested extra sauce for the potato twisters but did not receive it.We quickly ran out of drinks and sauce and we tried to get the attention of our server for over 20 minutes.  We pleaded for help from a red haired server who seemed less than interested and then we finally went caught the person from the front desk that seats people when he was seating a new table.Our server continued to ignore us and the desk person which was standing by our table trying to flag him down.  It was blatantly obvious that it was done on purpose.  When we finally got our server back, we again ask for drinks and refills.His response "Alriiight, alriiight, alriiiight" - like we were old friends, but we are not.  He takes the two cups from my children and my wife hands helpfully hands him the third cup. He proceeds to rudely snatch it from her and walk away. Which completely caught  us off guard.  At this point it had been over 30 minutes since we initially needed drinks.I had had enough from this point.  I found the manager to complain and ask for a new server.  While this was happening our server found his way from the back of the restaurant (where the kitchen and our table was) to the front where I was and stared me down and shoved into my shoulder with his shoulder as he walked pass.  Right in front of the manager!The manager sent the server to the back and apologized to me as the server went to the back of the restaurant while I was still at the front.    While the server was walking to the back again he said to my wife and children "F**k you!"My wife decided it was time for us to leave and we did promptly.  Again, the manager was apologetic and gave me his card and told me he was going to take care of the server with HR as soon as he could.  The time on my watch now was 9:30pm - it kind of wasted our night out.The worst part was running back to our vehicle from the restaurant - not knowing where the server was.  We were actually fearing for our lives at this point until we could leave the Casino property.It was very inappropriate with the bad service that we received from the server and the fact that he aggressively snatched a cup from my wife, then proceeded to AGGRESSIVELY TOUCH A CUSTOMER - shove into me with his shoulder while staring me down and then curse at my family at the table.  I tried to contact LBS Burger to follow up and make sure that this employee was dealt with appropriately, but they have been silent.Never again. Ever.Had dinner in Red Rock Resort / Casino / Spa's LBS last night with a couple of my kids. Nice little burger joint in the massive Red Rock compound. They make a pretty darn good burger.After a march around the casino to find a place that'd suit all our (ages) tastes. we settled on LBS Burger. We were seated right away, and asked our drink choices. Lemon mango tea, milk & a Guinness extra stout for me.  Nice variety.I went with Irish nachos to get us going (*mistake) and they had them out to us in a pretty quick fashion.FOOD:Irish Nachos......they were very BIG and tasty and loaded with criss cut fries, sour cream, chives, BACON, melty cheese, jalapeno slices, pico de gallo. 4***StarKids Meal Grilled Cheese (6 yo daughter)... Looked like it was just warmed in the oven...not grilled. Came with a butt load of tasty seasoned shoestring fries. 3**Stars (-1 for not grilled) She ate it all and loved it!Classic Burger (14 yo son)...1/3 lb burger (?)  American cheese, grilled onions, pickles, lettuce, tomato and special sauce. Also came with a boat load of seasoned shoestring fries. He removed pickles and tomatoes but said it was super good.

And put your food at mid chest level. Neat route 66 kind of decore for the 2012's If in the area I'd go back again.
Majerle's Sports Grill=in honor of the impending superbowl XLV, i wanted to write my majerles review. this year though, instead of hitting up a sports bar for the biggest day in football, i'll be going to a party. a real rager. if i wasn't though, i would definitely be pressed up against majerles front door bright and early superbowl morning. it's a great sports bar.the weirdest thing about majerles is their name. someone finally told me it wasn't pronounced "mah jer lees" like i had thought.... it's pronounced "mar lees". so let me get that out first.i'm a big sports nut.... well, let me rephrase that. i'm a big sports nut when it involves REAL sports. i won't make fun of anyone, but if it's not football, baseball, basketball or hockey i don't wanna hear about it. unless of course we're talking about extreme sports like surfing, skateboarding, etc. being a fan of sports makes me a fan of sports bars. there are only 3 main things i need in order for a sports bar to be great in my opinion. let me lay them out for you:a good selection of beers, happy hour specials and bar snacks--- yes, majerles has this in spades. large selection of beers and any sports bar that has perrier jouet, vueve clicquot and dom champagnes must be praised.(mostly because i think this is absolutely hilarious. WHO orders pricey champers at a sports bar? haha!) also, put me down as a fan of their reuben reuben and tenderloin sliders. yum.the service--- there's nothing worse than sidling up to a bar, excited to watch your team kick some ass and ordering a drink from a bartender that seems bored and unhappy. every bartender i've come in contact with at majerles truly loved being at work (or they at least acted like it). bartenders attitudes really carry a lot more weight then they realize. happy bartender =  happy bar patronsthe strategic placement of large TV sets for comfortable viewing pleasure--- yep. they designed this with real sports fans in mind. no matter where i sit, i can see a multitude of TV's with little blocking my view. so they have it all, and i likey. go here if you're looking for a good bar to watch the superbowl... or any sporting event for that matter. oh, and GO PACK GO!!!
Restaurant Fourquet Fourchette=When I rave about my time in Montreal, this is another one of the places that comes to mind. As a former beer judge, naturally I am a fan of Unibroue beer. It was tantalizing to be so close to the brewery in Chambly, but alas we did not have transportation. Luckily for us, Fourquet Fourchette, which celebrates the marriage of gastronomy and beer, has a restaurant in the city, which was fairly easy to find at the Palais des Congrès. The real treat at this restaurant turned out to be the menu itself, and having all of Unibroue's beers on tap was just icing on the cake. I've already mentioned that I am a fan of game meat. Well, the menu itself was full of game, which all sounded delicious (caribou pot pie, for example), I was having a hard enough time deciding what to get. Then our server came around and told us the daily specials, and that just made the decision even harder! The daily quiche was a quiche of game meats; the daily pasta was filled with duck meat and topped with bison jus; the daily seafood was some kind of local fish I can't remember; and the daily meat special was flank steak of horse. That's right, HORSE! I love Canada so much. Anyway, Vince got the horse and I got the duck pasta topped with bison. The horse was super flavorful, I was really glad I was able to try it. I loved my pasta because it was just crammed full of meat and topped with meat juice and more meat; no space wasted on silly things like cheese and sauce. For lunch, it was actually a super good deal, because everything came with a soup and salad bar, dessert and coffee. Of course we also each got a beer sampler, which came with Blanche de Chambly, Raftman, Chambly Noire, Maudite, La Fin du Monde, and Trois Pistoles. It was nice to be able to try the Raftman and Chambly Noire, since I haven't seen these in the US and they were lower in alcohol than the other Unibroue beers. Due to its location, it seems to attract mostly a business lunch crowd from the local office buildings, rather than tourists, though the servers are in traditional costume, evoking "the lost era of New France and its native culture." Our server Serge was amazingly nice and friendly, and was very helpful in suggesting places in Montreal for us to visit. We really appreciated his excellent service as well as all of the delicious food and beer. I highly recommend this place. During the week they are mostly just open for lunch; their hours are Monday to Wednesday: 11:30 to 4:00 p.m., Thursday and Friday: 11:30 to 10 p.m., Saturday: 5:30 to 10 p.m., and closed Sunday. They also have a location in Chambly.
L'Autre Version=***CUTE WAITER ALERT***I was in Montreal for work this past week and had only free night. My colleague and I decided we were going to head down to Old Montreal. We asked concierge for a restaurant recommendation and she suggested a place off Rue Saint-Paul. I can't remember the name of the place but when we arrived at the location, we learned they were closed for a few days. Darn! But there were a good number of restaurants on that street and after walking a few doors down, we came across and settled on L'Autre Version. The restaurant was fairly quiet on a Wednesday night. Besides the 2 of us, there were only 4 other parties throughout our entire 3 hour meal. Our waiter's name was Jean Claude I believe. I'd describe him as nerdy cute. He was tall, slender, good looking, with nicely-styled hair, black framed glasses and the cutest smile. I could picture him walking a high fashion runway vs. waiting tables. This young 25 year old was somewhat bashful which made him even more adorable. He was definitely nice eye candy for us older, married women. Along with his French accent...super dreamy! Ok, I'm starting to sound like a pervert so I'll move onto the food.The hostess that seated us told us that on Tuesdays and Wednesdays, they offered half-priced bottles on some of their wines. Sweet! We decided on a red wine from France - Julienas Domiane de la Conseillere. It was on the peppery side and very delicious.They were offering a tasting menu which we decided to share. This included a mise en bouche, 4 entrees, and a pastry surprise. You could add the foie gras dish for an additional charge which we did. We also ordered the Charcuterie Platter and Fall Salad. Prior to bringing out the food, they brought us some bread. Besides the usual olive oil & balsamic vinegar mixture and butter, there was salt and apple cider vinegar. You simply dip your bread in the ACV followed by salt. I suppose it's similar to how one eats fish & chips. I wasn't the biggest fan but my colleague loved it.-----*Fall Salad - served w/pears, pecans and shaved parmesan topped with a maple syrup vinaigrette. The salad was light and refreshing.*Charcuterie Platter - there were 4 slices each of Genoa, coppa, speck, and a 4th type which unfortunately I wasn't sure how to pronounce let alone spell. This was accompanied with a side of apple chutney which provided a nice sweet/savory balance.-----"The Good Version Tasting Menu":*The mise en bouche was Lobster Arancini - served with a saffron sauce. I loved the cheesy risotto center and crunchy outer coating.*Salmon Mi-Cuit - half cooked salmon w/horseradish sauce and topped with coriander panko. This was served with a side of greens, pickled onions and a lemony dressing. The texture of the salmon was smooth and buttery...practically melts in your mouth. And I liked the slight crunch from the panko.*Scallops - served with cauliflower purée and king eryngii mushroom. The scallops were cooked to perfection and topped with a caper sauce. The purée was silky and the mushrooms offered a nice bite.*Foie Gras Torchon - served with homemade brioche and a side of greens and golden beets. The piece of foie gras was lightly coated with pistachios. The foie gras was nice and creamy.*Beef Carpaccio - served with arugula pesto, grainy dijonnaise, some type of sprouts, parmesan and capers. The capers seemed to be deep fried adding a unique texture.*Braised Beef Short Rib - braised for 11 hours and served over crispy polenta. The meat was so tender and had just the right amount of fat to give it added flavor. There's nothing worse than dry polenta but that wasn't the case here because the polenta was crispy on the outside and moist on the inside. This was served with a napa cabbage salad and almonds. I loved the added crunch from the almonds and the acidic dressing on the salad helped neutralize any saltiness. We were so full by the time they brought this out and so bummed we weren't able to finish it all.*The pastry surprise was a chocolate mousse. It was decadent but not too sweet. I don't typically care for chocolate desserts but really enjoyed this one.-----Each and every dish was beautifully plated with the chef using food to create his masterpieces. We didn't catch his name but the server that brought out the food did a great job explaining each dish. At the end of our meal, JC asked us which dish was our favorite and we both couldn't say because everything tasted so good. Each dish was complex in flavor and texture. It was obvious that the chef put a lot of thought into making sure each ingredient used complemented one another. This was clearly a meal to remember and there was not one item that fell short of our expectations.**Tip - The restaurant offers free wifi. Just ask for the code. It was tough for us U.S. visitors to be  out-and-about without data so this was very much appreciated.
