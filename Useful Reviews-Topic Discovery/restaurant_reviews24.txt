Totally loved their small beef burrito. The enchilada and tacos are also good.  I couldn't even waste a single one of their homemade chips.  Come on ova to this busy joint, you won't be disappointed.

Restaurant name  The Habit Burger Grill

Review Text :
Five stars for a fast food chain?  Yes!  Cleanliness, friendliness, speed, efficiency, and food quality were all on point.  This is the first of 12 Habit Burger Grill's coming to the Valley.  They were somewhat busy when we stopped by for lunch today, but the line moved swiftly and the girl who took our was very sweet and proficient.  We had our receipt, drink cups, and our pager in less than a minute. Off we went to get drinks (Coke products, 3 different brewed iced tea choices, and strawberry lemonade), condiments, and some jalapeños from their pepper bar before sitting at a comfortable booth.  Our pager went off within a few minutes and we got to enjoy our delicious hot and fresh charburgers, sweet potato fries, and onion rings.  The charburger was juicy with a great flame broiled taste, the bun was light and fluffy, and the lettuce & tomato were fresh and crisp.The orders of onion rings and sweet potato fries were both generous in portion size.  We could have shared one order, but how can you try both that way!  The onion rings had a great crunch and a tasty batter.  They provided ranch with our rings if you like to dip.  The sweet potato fries were very good as well.  They were on the softer side which I liked (not fried to a crisp so you can't even tell they are sweet potatoes).  Next time I want to try the Tempura Green Beans, because they looked really good too!  The salads and grilled chicken sandwich are also on my future visits list.Nothing special.  Fresh vegetables on a bun with hardly any meat. My advice. . . get the double. PROS:  Flame broiled             Strawberry lemonade (homemade)CONS:  Not enough meat on the burgerJust had a Charburger at the Habit Burger Grill. It blew my mind... Not the burger, though I wish it did. No, the fact that I went to UC Santa Barbara for college, lived in Goleta where the first Habit location was founded and today is my first time having one of their menu item! Did that Goleta location shut down while I was there?  I have no idea. What I do know is that the Charbrburger is just alright. Better quality and fresher ingredients compared to McDonald's, but the burger just didn't wow me. Maybe I needed that Fry Sauce I read about in other reviews.The Strawberry Limeade is good though. Very sweet, so I had to water it down, but I liked it better as a sugary drink over the Charburger vs say a Single with Cheese Animal Style.Suggestion: avoid the lunch crowd, especially during the summer and the outside temperature is in the low 100s, because that's where you will have to sit and eat if you can't fight for one of the coveted indoor seating spaces.Carpool if you can too, because Panera has crazy lunch crowds too and the parking lot is also shared with Chipotle, Jamba Juice & Pieology. The clear winner? The owner of this strip mall of course!"I feel it"-----------------------------------------­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­-----------------------Quick Review™*This rating and review is based on a series of firsthand experiences of patronising this restaurant located on Flamingo/Paradise.*For the purposes of contextualization of this review: I have never visited any other The Habit Burger Grill location. I was a Habit virgin.*Some items I have tried: Charburger, Double Charburger with Cheese, Veggie Burger, Chicken sandwich, Chicken Club, Sweet Potato Fries, Fries, Strawberry Shake, Strawberry Limeade. All good or better.Pro Tip: Strawberry shake is the best I have had at a fast food-casual. The music being played is also the best in terms of FF-C.-----------------------------------------­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­-----------------------Someone convinced me to try The Habit; I was at Coachella. I looked in at the location in Indio; however, the enormous crowds that congregated during April were just too long of a wait for fast food or fast casual or whatever the fuck this is considered. So, I never tried it until it debuted in Vegas. And even then: I was not in a rush. It was the No Kid Hungry® charity campaign that brought me in the doors and subsequently made me a fan. The food is solid for fast food/casual; the strawberry limeade might be the best drink I have ever had at any fast food/casual anywhere. Easily would go the proverbial distance in a bout against the strawberry limeade at Cafe Rio®. Only way to find out would be a double blind test. Pro Tip: Get the strawberry limeade. It's Best in Show™.-----------------------------------------­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­-----------------------Step 1: Place your order with the personable order-taker. Step 2: Take the buzzer and proceed to wait/wash your filthy hands since you just felt up a buzzer that has been touched by a hundred people who spend all day doing everything besides washing their hands.Step 3: Eat. Step 4: Refill your strawberry limeade before hitting the road.Pro Tip: Construction on Flamingo makes it cumbersome to get back on Paradise. Drive north on Hughes Circle until it leads to Paradise just south of Gordon Biersch. This could be helpful to UNLV or Hard Rock Hotel visitors. -----------------------------------------­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­-----------------------Rating: Five-stars, "Woohoo! As good as it gets!"

Review Text :
I'm going to save that elusive five star for a proper visit back, but Harry's earned a little Yelp love this week. I recently hosted a tasting with John Gilmour Butchers. As the bells and whistles of the evening were organized by someone else, I didn't have any say over the hosting venue.... which can be a bit nerve wracking when you're a little ocd event planner. When Harry's Bar & Grill was mentioned, I immediately took to Google and... proceeded to have a minor panic attack. My Google search brought up the former Harry's Bar and the reviews/photos were about as polar opposite as I'd want for a swanky steak event... I knew they had renovated, but really... how much different could it be?Very. Very freaking different. COMPLETELY different.Thank the event gods!I'm not sure if the staff noticed my audible sigh and not so subtle happy dance when I walked through the door but walking into this beautiful, contemporary room was like Christmas. The space is lovely, polished and a complete 180 from its former inhabitant. They have a great bar space, good outdoor seating and a swanky atmosphere, without being stuffy. Plus: they have wifi.*Happy Dance*So we settled into our evening, where the Harry's Bar team were in charge of grilling up the steaks for our table. No problem there, they happen to have a Josper oven. Read: fancy pants charcoal oven.*Happy Dance*Not to mention, really damn fine chips and a decent whisky selection behind the bar.*Happy Dance*It's also a ten minute walk from my house, is open at lunch... and did I mention the solid wifi?*Happy Happy Happy Dance*Needless to say, what I imagined might be a total train wreck of an evening, turned into one of my most pleasant event surprises. I should be more trusting... especially when steak and chips are involved.

Review Text :
I was soooooo looking forward to this place opening since being a SoCal native and been to the Manhattan Beach location! Beautiful interior nothing like it here in Las Vegas! I wanted to seriously love this place but $14.00 for plain nachos? Really? Hello? Wake up call- this is not SoCal and this is not Manhattan Beach! $18.00 for an enchilada? These prices are unrealistic even for Summerlin! This is Mexican Food! The cheapest food you can buy and make! I know you spent 3 million on the building and I can imagine your rent but with there prices I give you 6 months then Via Con Dios! Plenty of near by places cheaper with established service and food...lower your prices if you want to survive here in Las Vegas! I don't mind spending money on food but really? Expensive Mexican food is an oxy moron at this point!New place! New vibes! Familiar tastes...I've been watching this building come together for months so I was super excited to finally walk through the beautiful doors. When it comes to first impressions, it was love at first sight. A major wow factor! Whoever designed this place deserves 5 stars. They brought the beauty of Mexico to us in Vegas! It reminded me of the movie ~ Original Sin with Angelina Jolie. I do have one note about the design and that's the little room behind the beautiful staircase. I highly suggest that room is used for private parties & events only because customers don't get the true experience sitting there. We were guided over to it and I said no way, then we were sat in the lovely courtyard & I couldn't get enough of that space! Art, central fountain & greenery surrounded us and I loved it all. The service was fantastic & I'm even going to give a shoutout to Jason who took great care of us and was also very sweet & funny. The food was good, not amazing. I've definitely had better but everything also tasted better sitting in this space. We also only tried one thing but that's how it goes sometimes. We ordered the enchiladas de Langosta which were filled with lots of luscious lobster. Prices are high here but they definitely didn't gip us on the seafood. I also need to add that the portions are HUGE. We shared and couldn't even finish everything. The black beans lacked in flavor & were a tad undercooked. The green rice was perfect and the creamy chipotle sauce was super rich, a tad too rich for me. Overall it was good but not amazing. I needed bolder flavors but I'm still interested in going back & trying something else. The menu itself offered a lot of classics & a few unique dishes so it'll have something for everyone.This place gets two stars because the interior decor is gorgeous (for the most part) and the chips are nommy.  The waitstaff is good about filling beverages and chips. That's it.  You are paying for the decor and construction costs, and not getting quality or tasty food in return. I ate here last week for lunch, after being told there was a two hour wait on opening day (despite the restaurant not being full).  I was seated immediately this time, after the hostess rudely remarking that she remembered me from the previous week.  I was brought to a table near the base of the stairs... So far so good.  Although the water in the fountain was green and cloudy.I ordered a chicken chimi and iced tea. This was around 2:30 pm and it still took about 45 minutes for my food to come out.  By that time I'd eaten way too many chips (yeah they're good although the salsa is just meh) and wasn't very hungry.  Which is good because my chimi was the smallest burrito I've ever seen.  It was dry and lacking in flavor and I left half of it and the beans and rice (also meh) on my plate.  Definitely not impressed.I've had better food for a fifth of the price at Roberto's Taco Shop, and that's saying something, since I think Roberto's is also crap!Don't waste your money.  If it wasn't for the pleasant server ( who was taking care of way to many tables); I would give this place no stars. Believe the bad reviews and be suspicious of the positive ones.  Food lacks flavor or personality and is over priced. Service is excruciatingly slow.  I simply did not enjoy my meal and I am annoyed that I can never get the time back that I spent  waiting for my disappointing meal. I would rather eat at Chioplte or Cafe Rio. Mediocre food and abysmal service  at 4 star prices.Honest review about the place. First problem, seated next to the door of the kitchen. The people had to walk in between 2 customers chairs to get in and out. They shouldn't have table at that spot. Overall they need to remove some tables from the place period!! Not comfy seating environment. The manager dropped a dirty fork on my friend's shoulder and didn't even apologize. We asked for a move, which took another 20 minutes because the host forgot about us. Finally they moved us to another table. The manager came smoozed with us after but he never acknowledged the fork incident. The food is mediocre, I ordered a $25 menu item which should've of been $11.99 at most places. It's very overpriced, these prices work for Manhattan Beach , CA for their original location, not Vegas. The food is bland and uninspiring, especially when we have amazing Mexican food here like Lindo, La Mojarra Loca...etc etc. To diners who love food, this is a skip!

Restaurant name  That BBQ Joint
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
I ended up at That BBQ Joint (TBJ) by happenstance after my efforts to visit the newly opened A-OK Coffee location on East Washington Avenue were foiled by my inability to find a parking space.  But my luck was not all bad that day as both the food and service at TBJ exceeded my expectations.  There is a definite black and white theme to the restaurant interior.  The interior walls have a fresh coat of institutional white paint, with black trim around the doors and windows.  The menus are written on whiteboards with black ink and the food comes on a black & white checkerboard patterned paper liner.  The large front windows allow for waves of natural light to stream into the interior and allow diners keep tabs on the action taking place on Willy Street.  While the building has seen better days, the new occupants have cleaned it up nicely.Since TBJ does not have waiter service, I had limited interaction with the staff.  Nonetheless, all the staff members I interacted with were courteous, polite and helpful.  As a first time visitor, my order taker offered helpful suggestions when I mentioned I was visiting for the first time.  He also checked in to see what I thought of my sandwich which doesn't always happen at counter service restaurants.  Throughout my time at TBJ, this employee was constantly tidying out the dining area and checking the condiment supply levels when there was a break in the somewhat steady flow of lunch time customers.I elected to go with the Thursday special, the TBJ Cubano sandwich (pulled pork, ham, mustard, pickles and a pressed, well-buttered French roll). Mad props to the kitchen for their fantastic griddle work on the French roll as every bite yielded a satisfying crunch.  The pulled pork component provided plenty of porky deliciousness.  The Achilles heel of the sandwich was the ocean of generic yellow mustard slathered onto the sandwich.  With a little better balance, this could be a top echelon sandwich in town with an amazing stable of sandwich offerings.Bonus content: TBJ sells bottles of their sauce for $8.After this positive first impression, a return visit to TBJ is certainly in my future.  The wonderful aroma of smoked meats wafting through the restaurant during my first visit has me eager to try there more traditional BBQ offerings of smoked brisket, ribs, pulled pork and smoked chicken.

Review Text :
OK, this place is new. So we must give them time. Always want local businesses to succeed. We have been waiting for a while for Leo's Pizza to open up. Finally they are.We ordered the cheesy bread, and large pepperoni and jalapeno pizza with extra thin crust.Cheesy bread was great, comes out extra hot. Cheese is like it's name. Very cheesy and taste great. The marinara sauce is also very good.Pizza was OK, came out very hot. Smells great, truth be told, taste is not bad. However, bottom of crust is very crispy. But it gets soft on top of the crust. My guess they need to cook it slower and hotter. The ingredients were great. Sauce, cheese, pepperoni are good. Jalapeno was awesome, pickled perfect, and very spicy. Place really doesn't have a decor. Seats 48 people, but has four big screens. Has your basic tables and chairs. They do have about four beers on draft. A nice menu selection, and desert. Would we try this place again? Of course. I am hoping, it gets better as time goes on.

Restaurant name  Zydeco Po-Boys
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
I love all the great new restaurants popping up in this part of town! Stopped in on opening day for a poboy and was pleasantly surprised by the modern-country interior. The colorful stick-on letters for the menu and signage felt a little cheap, wonder if they're still waiting on more permanent signage?In any case, service was polite and suggested the shrimp poboy or their daily special (today's was turkey, ham, and brisket)- all sides are extra and sandwiches range from about $10-13. Large sandwich easily feeds two, and the meats tasted fresh-cut, but the bread was ridiculously dry and falling apart. Wish I'd opted for the classic shrimp or debris version, as the special lacked any sort of Cajun sauce or Louisiana pizazz. Next time I'll have to add on a side of gumbo or Cajun fries. Sides are a bit pricey and sandwiches are huge, not a great place to fly solo.

Restaurant name  Smoke Modern Barbeque
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
My wife and i joked about just what Modern BBQ could be?  Fusion or some other adulteration of southern BBQ?  We entered with trepidation.And we were wonderfully surprised to find a modern, almost nightclub ambiance, comfortable and easy on the eyes.  Hostess seated, we met a very fine Bahamian waiter, Sanfred.  In his soft accent he described the menu, answered our questions and returned shortly to take our order.The menu had the standard chicken, pulled port, ribs, beef brisket & sausage meats and then a nice selection of sandwiches, salads, appetizers and sides.  Good job and the descriptions were excellent.Iced tea was served in glasses and refilled via a fresh glass...rather than the splashing, ice filled pitchers more commonly found in other BBQ places.  And the unsweetened tea did not need sweeteners, well brewed and not bitter.We split a house salad which was huge.  Doubt is one could eat a whole salad and any other main since the salad was so plentiful.  Dressings were all house-made.  Excellent.Beef brisket, a favorite of ours and not easy to find outside of Texas, was excellent.  If you simply order brisket you will get fatty and lean slices, so specify your preference.  My wife asked for her two fatty slices to be traded for lean and this was accommodated easily.  I ordered a two meat combo of pulled pork and brisket and received a good portion of each.The pulled pork is without sauce, so you can first taste how savory that smoked meat tinted with burnt edges truly is.  Then add one of the four sauces on the table:  mustard, vinegar, KC sweet and KC spicy. The spicy was Goldilocks just right for both of us.Sides included excellent mac & cheese and creamed spinach, along with a cider slaw.  All three were excellent and served in their own small bowl.  We brought most of the two sides home as the portions were too much to eat given the salad and meats.Prices were a bit high, but the quality of the smoking, sides, menu options and generous portions validated the costs.  Our lunch for two was right at $50 and that was with iced tea, no booze.Nice experience and quality without the mob scene found in surrounding more casual BBQ joints.  Will try more items as time goes on, most likely resulting in a five-star rating.

Review Text :
It's true, it's true! all the previous reviews of 5 stars is not a joke this is SUSHI the way it's meant to be! Lana and I had lunch here today and we were very impressed with the service, the decor and especially the important part, the SUSHI!OMG! think back to your last sushi meal, do you remember anything that was really a stand out? How about something common as a spicy tuna roll, do you remember it or did you just consume it because you were hungry? Hiroba Sushi must be what it is like in the home of genuine sushi back in Japan. The menu is very extensive and there are no objectionable names describing the various items to dine on, if you know what I mean. Severs here rate up there with the best fine dining establishments in a 5 star resort. You can relax, enjoy some sake or beer and watch some sports on TV if you wish, but the shining star is Sushi!The menu had so many choices some your recognize and some that are new to us. We chose a few on our own and we got some ideas from previous Yelp reviews.What we ordered:The "Green Monster", delicious and that fresh, smooth avocado was perfect. You can taste every ingredient and the presentation is impressive. We ordered a second one in a matter of minutes!"Hamachi Crunch" was awesome! it was gone in no time. The Caribbean, Salmon Lovers and a common spicy tuna roll is the freshest and tastiest we ever had.Lana's big complaint in most sushi places is the temperature of the fish and here at Hiroba the fish is noticeably cold and FRESH. Who here has had nigiri sushi served at near room temperature? Well it just won't happen here. The serving temperature is prefect, you will notice the cool, fresh serving temperature in every bite and the fish has the essence of the sea. This was our first visit, but we know we will be back again and again, it's that good!Our server explained to us that even the iced green tea was freshly brewed and organic, it was served Thai Iced tea style with a side of cream if you preferred it served that way.Many years ago, this same location was called "Sushi Club" and it was the only place for sushi for us and for some unfortunate reason it closed down. Then it was recently a Italian and sub sandwich shop which also didn't make it. Well, good things come to those who wait and for the many sushi fans that keep wandering southern Nevada for the sushi of their dreams, this is it. Search no more, this place is TOPGUN sushi with a unique approach, it's fresh, tasty and very reasonably priced.Stop going to AYCE (All You Can Eat) feeling terrible as you stumble back to your car, Hiroba Sushi is the pinnacle of the art of Japanese sushi, like a big tuna caught on a line, we are HOOKED!Hiroba is another great non-AYCE sushi spot in the Anthem area. They have the total package: amazing food, superb customer service, and great prices.Honestly, I am not much of a "roll" person, but their rolls make me a believer. I normally steer free from rolls with cream cheese and excessive sauces; however, Hiroba does an excellent job of balancing flavors, while maintaining creativity at the same time. My absolute favorite roll here is the lemon roll. Other sushi places have failed to deliver this simple roll, but Hiroba hands down nails it! Something about that lemon-y ponzu sauce just puts it over the top for me. I love that they top this roll with both hamachi (yellowtail) and salmon. An interesting, yet intriguing roll is the crunchy tower (5 pieces). It is deep fried spicy salmon, avocado cream cheese fruit mix, crispy shallots, roasted nuts, drizzled with eel and mango sauce.   Seriously, don't knock it until you try it. It's different, but totally works. The green monster is on the roll menu, but is hardly a roll. The inner core is a mix of chopped soft shell crab, surimi crab, and yum yum scallops. All this is encapsulated by avocado and topped with crispy shallots. *Side note: the rolls here are flavorful on their own. I barely touched the soy sauce, wasabi, or ginger.*Honorable mention: snow white roll. Love the subtle smokiness of this roll and overall taste! They offer a full menu including: udon, yaki soba,  fried rice, donburi, entrees, and bento boxes. Everyone who works here have been so welcoming and friendly. Attentive service without hovering.  Most importantly, fish was fresh and of great quality!

Restaurant name  Niu-Gu Noodle House
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
Are there guidelines to what ramen should and should not be?Niu-Gu is an outlier to what traditional ramen styles are, but would closely resemble to Tantan-men or Dandan noodles. The broth is clear like much of traditional Chinese/Vietnamese noodles, cleaner and not as heavy (better for the summertime, or when you're sick in bed and don't want to eat much). The lemon pepper broth sounds strange but its really similar to Northern Chinese noodles. The bowl is brought out on a cart and then a hand torch is used on the onions to give it a char flavor perhaps. Comes with a couple pieces of charred short rib slices that are soft, a little smokey, and melt in your mouth good.The Niu-Gu Rib items (short ribs and lamb) require you to call ahead of time, and seems to be a bit of a hassle to order and the regular lamb chop I believe has a 15-20 min wait time, so consider calling ahead if you're here for a quick meal!Niu-Gu is different than traditional ramen, and maybe some people would consider it fusion or a new style, but with so much resemblance to old school Chinese noodles, maybe its really the ORIGINAL style.

Nice digs!  Nice waitstaff!Great bacon!Really good Bakn Bakn Bakn breakfast with some thinly sliced tasty potato home fries and toast.The menu is creative and has many items that do not have bacon.  Looking forward to returning and trying some other items.Found out they are open all day including dinner with the same menu.  A full bar with wine, beer and specialty drinks is available.  I did think the prices were a little high.Got Bakn!Love the Bacon! Two visits for dinner and was so pleased with the service and food.Laura was tremendous and fun on the night we had a group. We had to wait at the bar for about 20 minutes, but that was good too.We shared a couple of apps, Bakn flatbread and sausage stuffed banana peppers.  A good start to a good meal.  The slow braised short ribs came with a creamy parmesan polenta, much better then my own, applewood bakn and a sunny side egg.  The sauce is made by Chef Randy's mom, so good.On the other visit, the family went and enjoyed.  I had the Bakn Bley Burger with slaw.  The burger was cooked to temperature and very good.  The slaw was fresh and OK, I prefer a little tang to my slaw.

Review Text :
A free standing Miracle Mile- hell yes! Since the downfall of the locations I grew up with at Park Central, and ChrisTown Malls, the closing of the locations at both Arrowhead and what used to be The Colonade Mall (turned into some kind of strip mall place), I was thinking I would never again get to have a hot pastrami sandwich from a place that has been in my life since I moved to Phoenix at the age of 4 and that had been in my maternal families life since before then.We came on a Sunday around noon after we were at the cemetery for the unveiling of my Grandmother's headstone. It was had/has been an emotional time and going to a place that had an historical place in my memory and in our family seemed somewhat appropriate. The ONLY thing that was missing was the Karsha's rye bread (Karsha's closed) and the rye bread they are using isn't quite as tasty, with the right kind of pull. The pastrami was just like all of my memories. MM used to be a Jewish Deli and has been Jewish "Style" for years and years now. My husband loved his turkeyBLTA and his side knish and everyone else enjoyed what they had. Private parking lot- and perfectly planned thick covered door handle coverings so you don't burn your hands opening the door.Looking forward to coming back.

Restaurant name  Max's Farm Table
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
My recent lunchtime visit to Max's Farm Table was a study in contrasts - the deficiencies of the front of house unfortunately detracted from the glimpses of greatness exhibited by the kitchen.  Factoring the unevenness of the food and that the limited menu is not well-configured for the lunch crowd, I plan to sit on the sidelines while the restaurant works out these kinks.I enjoyed the look and feel of the restaurant, from the gleaming stainless steel of the open kitchen, the stylish muted gold, blue and terra cotta color palette used throughout the interior. Seating options plentiful - both booths and tables are available.  The loud background music, a heavy dose of soft rock from 70's and 80's seemed louder than necessary in a near empty restaurant.The limited menu in place when I visited had burgers, pizzas and sandwiches.  The sandwiches do not come with any sides, but there are a handful of a la carte options: fries ($4 for a small order, $7 for a large), soup (pricey at $6 for a cup) and a salad (no description $7).  The restaurant also offers a Friday fish fry and has a separate weekend brunch menu.I ordered the chicken sandwich (described as slow roasted chicken with onions, green peppers and mushrooms served on a freshly baked roll) for $9.  While the chicken was moist and tender, it needed a fairly liberal dose of salt.  The lightly sautéed red, orange and green peppers made the sandwich look visually appealing and added some textural contrast to my sandwich.  I felt the undercooked onions could have used more time in the sauté pan to enhance their flavor. While the menu indicated the sandwich came with mushrooms, I did not notice any of them.  The toasted homemade bun had fantastic flavor and just the right density.  I liked but not loved this sandwich - even when I added more salt, this dish lacked any punch, nothing to make it memorable.  As I mentioned earlier, my meal did not come with a side, but during the course of my meal, by server offered me a small sample of the roasted squash soup which ended up being the highlight of my visit.  The soup was more like a puree, but was packed with flavor that comes from slow roasting the squash.  Unlike my sandwich, the soup was masterfully seasoned.  The person that prepared that dish displayed some mad cooking chops.While that soup was the pinnacle of my experience, the service was the nadir.  From the moment I set foot in the restaurant, confusion reigned.  For starters, here was no host station, so it was unclear whether I should order at the counter or wait to be seated.  After I stood confused for about a minute in the middle of the restaurant, a server finally saw my perplexed look and indicated I could sit where ever I wanted.  After grabbing a seat in one of the booths in the back of the establishment, the server quickly came by with a menu and a glass of water.  Then nothing for 10 awkward minutes.  There were only three other sets of patrons, so it wasn't like the restaurant was at capacity.  My food came quickly once I finally ordered, but it was delivered with no silverware or napkins.  When I needed salt for my under-seasoned sandwich, I had to wander around the dining area looking for my server because she never checked in after delivering my food.  Same story when I realized I needed some silverware to eat my unwieldy sandwich - get up and hunt for utensils.  While the Yelp business listing indicates that Max's has free wi-fi, when I asked my server for the password, she indicated it is not available for customers.  To be fair, my server was quite personable when I interacted with her, but it seemed like she had no serving experience and little training from management. Will I visit Max's again...probably, the potential from my tiny sample of the magnificent squash soup gives me reason to be optimistic.  But I'll probably wait six months to give the restaurant time to work through the service issues and fine tune the menu.

Items Ordered:Tomato Pie with PepperoniWhite Pie with Artichoke HeartsCannoliTiramisuBlack and White CookieLocated in the increasingly busy Pawn Plaza, but still more of a 'secret' than the unnamed space owned by the same group at The Cosmopolitan, Inna Godda di Pizza occupies the downstairs corner pocket furthest from The Strip and featuring similar pies to those that have impressed both critics as well as the late night Marquee crowd ever since opening a visit to the month old space was every bit as good as the original, even an early morning oven malfunction not preventing a pair of freshly made pies from shining.Not remotely a New Yorker, nor one to romanticize late nights slurping a soggy "99cent slice," it was with the same standards and biases as always that I entered Inna Gadda di Pizza, and although Foghat played in place of expected Iron Butterfly while the owner explained that an overnight oven shutdown had delayed the day's preparations it was with a little patience and conversation that minutes passed, each dough rolled out and hand stretched before careful topping, the $3 Red and $3.50 White by-the-slice options quickly sold to a steady stream of traffic, the vast majority visiting from out of town.Proudly touting the use of ingredients that justify paying a few cents more per bite, suffice it to say that compared to "Secret Pizza" the prices trend a bit lower at the new location, and with a nice char imparted to the crust by "about ten minutes at five-fifty" both the bright and zingy red sauce beneath melted Mozz and garlic cream with dollops of ricotta plus house-smoked tomatoes were on par with the best in the genre, the fifty-cent toppings and absolute steal for a handful of marinated artichoke hearts while pepperoni was a touch oily and less well-spiced than expected.Surprisingly offering three desserts, all made n house and ranging $2-$4 each, anyone filling cannoli to-order deserves support and taking the time to match crisp shells to sweet cheese tinged in citrus the two-bite pastries were delightfully light yet extremely flavorful, a spot less less praise offered for a small bowl of tiramisu that seemed a bit too soggy at its base despite generous coffee notes while the seemingly out-of-place Black & White was smaller than most, yet moist and fluffy enough that you may want two.****About as good as it gets for a "slice shop" particularly on Las Vegas Boulevard for less than $4, Inna Gadda di Pizza is only likely to get better with time and seasoning of the ovens, a few small tweaks potentially capable of making this the first "must-visit" spot at Pawn Plaza for locals as well as tourists.White pizza, $3.50 by the slice and incredible: mozzarella, garlic cream, dollops of ricotta, house-smoked tomatoes, and a drizzle of pesto. Definitely going to add artichokes or anchovies next time!Space is small with pizzas on display ready to toss in the oven. Shakers of oregano, parm, and red pepper flakes available on your way out, covered outdoor patio seating available. Service was super friendly. Despite being a bustling area, it was a quick stop to grab a slice at a good price. Bonus points for the "real talk" at the bottom of the menu: NO RANCH DRESSING!

Review Text :
Nani Restaurant made a favorable impression during recent weekday lunch foray.  As an unabashed multi-cultural dumplingphile, I was pleased to see the early favorable reviews.  So I convinced a couple of co-workers to join me for a whirlwind trip through Nani's dim sum menu.  It's been years since I visited this location; I think it was an ill-fated Mongolian stir-fry place in that iteration.  The new owners definitely classed the place up with a thorough renovation, adding plenty of stylish lighting to give the place a more chic vibe (as best you can for an old all you can eat buffet location).  The host immediately greeted us and led us to our table.  Our server appeared before we were settled in and shared both the lunch menu (mainly Americanized Chinese dishes) and the expansive dim sum menu.  After a vigorous debate over the merits of many of the dim sum options, we decided on the pork pot stickers, shrimp and pork dumplings, BBQ pork buns and one of spare rib options,  (Alas, no one was willing to sample the chicken feet with me - I had to save that dish for another time).  One of my co-workers also ordered the sesame chicken entrée from the lunch menu.  Shortly after we placed our order, the steam baskets with our dim sum offerings started hitting our table.  The exterior of the pot stickers had an impressive brown sear and the filling brimmed with porcine goodness.  For some unknown reason, the podstickers were bereft of any dipping sauce, which is an almost unpardonable omission.  The BBQ Pork bun were the weak link of the meal, with a too sweet bun and just a thimbleful of underseasoned pork (nothing like the version of this dish than I devoured at Umami earlier this year).The bone-in pork spareribs were the showstopper of our meal.  Packed in a flavorful broth, this dish provided a mouthful of flavor with every bite.  Also impressive were the delectable shrimp and pork dumplings, though they also could have benefited from a dipping sauce.I felt the kitchen did an admirable job with the sesame chicken, which provided a pleasing crunch with every bite.  For a new restaurant that has had little fanfare, there was an active midweek lunch service.  Many restaurants have come and gone from this building, hopefully Nani can break the curse of this location.  There are far many dim sum offerings that I have yet to try.I learned about Nani thanks to Yelp and immediately added it to my "to try" list. Little did I know it would only be a few days later that I'd be asked me to decide where to meet someone for lunch. I am so happy we came here! The location is tucked just a bit out of the way, so folks might miss it if they're driving through, but it's absolutely worth checking out. I'd never visited the previous iterations, but agree with other reviewers who say that the interior is well done. For me, this doesn't always matter as much if the food is good, but I found it notable in this case.This is my first experience with Dim Sum, so I can't speak to authenticity or compare to other locations. What I can say is that I love most any Asian cuisine I've tried and thought it was amazing. It doesn't hurt that I'm a fan of dumplings of pretty much any heritage. We spent most of our time going over the vast menus. First we were handed the lunch menu, which seemed to cover the sorts of American-Chinese dishes I grew up with so we skipped it altogether. The dim sum menu was completely new to me, and my partner was enthralled by their main menu, which is HUGE. We were warned that the dishes in the main menu were meant to serve more than one person, and they were right, we had some leftovers to share with our housemates.I realized shortly after getting through the dim sum menu that I'd have to take a look at the rest later. I already wanted to try more than I could eat... so I chose the beef brisket with rice noodle in a pot, the pan fried vegetable and pork bun, and the sweet custard roll. Everything was delicious, although I was surprised by the ratio of bun to limited filling and just a little put off by the skin and fat/cartilage in the pot. Of course, I realize that's probably more traditional than what I'm used to so I just picked through it. The flavor was very good. I shared those leftovers with one of my housemates when I got home and he ate the rest, so it's clearly a matter of preference. The custard rolls were perfect... great fluffy texture while not too sweet. Mmm.This particular companion is more adventurous than I am when it comes to food, so many options on the menu were tantalizing to him. He ended up ordering the ox tongue with tripe in chili sauce and loved it. From the dim sum menu he chose the shrimp crepes, which received an emphatic thumbs up while chewing. He's going to have to find someone else to try the chicken feet or octopus with, but I appreciate that those items are on the menu.Service was great. Our waitress checked in regularly and another young lady checked in with us to see if we had any questions. She was extremely helpful to us first-timers. I was surprised by how quickly our dishes started coming out; we were eating in no-time. Extra bonus points for their tea service. I had a nice big metal pot of green tea to myself. No dinky mini-teapot, and this baby stayed HOT the whole time we were there. This alone made me pretty happy, but add everything else and I simply can't wait to come back again and again to continue trying other items on their menu.

Review Text :
Cafe Hollander comes to Madison in a big way... They opened a stunningly beautiful, brand-new restaurant at Hilldale that seats 450 - featuring an amazing second floor patio, retractable roof, and garage door windows around the whole first floor that open. The Madison restaurant scene has escalated to another level, especially in the Hilldale area.We visited during the soft opening, so there were some hiccups, but if it's as good as the Milwaukee location, things will be great in no time. Out of the 7 in our group, most either liked or loved their food. Their beer selection and brunch menu is strong, and that's what they focus on.Prices are not too high but don't get comfortable, they add up quickly - $9 for a bloody, $5-7 for beer, $2 extra for side salad, etc.3-stars, but *barely*. I've been here a few times now, including a brunch, and I'm just not feeling it. + The place is MASSIVE. They can seat nearly 500 people here. It's a monstrous location.- Bigger isn't better. Despite the huge seating capacity, the actual bar is rather small (seats maybe 20?), and the physical/actual bar offers the only "first come, first served" seating. All other seating is by reservation only, including hightops in the bar area.+ Despite the huge, open space, noise levels are well-maintained- No waiting space, aside from the aforementioned smallish bar with very limited seats+ Super friendly hosts/hostesses+ iPad/we'll-text-you-when-your-table's-ready system is genius, and works well+ Huge beer menu, although most are in bottles- Beer menu is difficult to read, especially in low light (tiny font & glossy pages)- Taps are rather mundane with few local offerings (all things relative)+ Decent menu- Nothing on the menu is outstanding or particularly noteworthy- It's pricey, given the overall quality of the food+ Kitchen was *fast* at dinner time (food arrived within 5 minutes)- Kitchen was *glacially slow* during brunch and screwed-up every order - Service is hit-or-miss, both at the bar and at tablesBrunch experience details:Met group of friends here for brunch. We arrived just minutes after they opened for the day, and were immediately seated. It took 20+ minutes and three trips to the hostess station before a waitress stopped by with water/menus. The entire visit was a nightmare... drinks were made wrong, coffees were forgotten and then rarely refilled, food orders were all incorrect, and our server was completely absent. We spent 2 hours and 25 minutes there for a brunch and it's time I'll never get back. I called the manager, who apologized profusely and admitted they were a bit overwhelmed at the time... Lunch details:Went here with a group of coworkers for lunch; seated fairly quickly and had decent service, but nothing remarkable. Most folks liked their food, but I felt many items were overly greasy (Brussels Sprouts were drenched in oil). Sampled many items via coworkers, and most were rather plain and reminded me of what I'd find at any national chain like Applebee's, Olive Garden, or Chili's.Dinner details:Swung by here around 7pm on a Wednesday night, some 5-6 weeks after the place opened. Wait time for a table for two was 45-55 minutes. Really???? I didn't wait that long for a table at Nobu in NYC. Oye. Madisonian's love a new restaurant. Eventually found seats at the bar, where service was decent, but nothing great. One bartender was personable, the other two were "all business" and made me feel rushed and much like I was a number. Food during dinner was overly salty and tasted very "commercial." Nothing great. Given the choice, I'd *much* rather visit Oliver's Public House, Forequarter, or even Mr Brews. It's a cool looking place, but looks only get you so far.

It is really cool that we now have this famous Tucson restaurant in the Phoenix valley. Hot Dogs are one of my favorite past times and I deciced to go and check them out sooner than later.This is an old Discount tire store where they remodeled the garage section into a seating area and turned the waiting room into their bakery. The acoustics are rather noisy and they are continuously calling out order numbers over the ear numbing speaker system. Ordered two of the Sonoran Dogs with everything on them and a large Carmelo which comes with Beef, Beans and melted Cheese. They also have a really nice salsa bar with plenty of items to enhance the flavors of your meal.The Hot Dogs were pretty good but not the best in town. The buns are not as sweet as they usually are at other places and a little more on the chewy side. It was difficult to taste the bacon and the flavors were a bit bland. The Caramelo was interestingly good and was even better with tons of added goodies from the salsa bar.This place gets really busy and they do a pretty good job of getting the food out quickly. It was fun watching the excitement in all the happy customers as they sat down and ate with their extended families.I'm going to round up on this particular restaurant and figure that they are still ironing out some the typical problems with opening any new location. Come on over and give them a shout out. You will find the experience to be fun and exciting. HOT DOG!3.75 STARS

Last night I came to dinner here w/ a friend of mine who has known Chef Marc for many years. Chef Marc is a personable and talented man who has absolute passion for cooking and happiness of his customers.Better if you can believe it, than what I recall of his former restaurant Parma, I had the pleasure of tasting Marc's delicious Italian cuisine at his brand new restaurant located in a small strip center @ SW corner of Sahara & Durango, behind Lakeside Charlies.Shared appetizers were delicious...*Mozzarella en Carozza--Fresh mozzarella wedged in thin bread then fried, w/ tasty marinara dipping sauce.**Cold Seafood Salad--Wild shrimp, mussels, calamari, imported provolone, hot cherry peppers.My entree was delicious...Barbershop Bone-in Chicken Scarpariello...roasted w/ Italian sausage over polenta. A bit of a challenge w/ bone-in, but managed to act like a surgeon and savored the perfectly cooked juicy, tender organic chicken meat. Sausage had a nice tangy flavor. Polenta was very good. Green beans were al dente and excellent.Dessert was delicious...Creme Brulee that was torched tableside by Tracy, 1 of Marc's friendly servers. Sweet & flavorful w/ fresh berries.Nicely decorated upscale restaurant w/ cool wall decor, nice lighting & furnishings, and the sounds of enjoyable Ratpack background music that was a classy touch around this time of what would be Frank Sinatra's 100th birthday.Service was impeccable by our friendly server Lino, originally from Italy. And once again, Chef Marc is a true restaurant entrepreneur w/ passion and talent for his Italian cuisine. I highly recommend dining here!See 8 photos below...YELP 300 CHALLENGE 2015: #296

Très bonne découverte ce soir !La salle est grande avec des tables classiques, des tables hautes et la possibilité d'aller au bar bien sur !Quand nous sommes arrivés vers 19h ca commençait à être pas mal plein, comme un vendredi soir !La déco est sympa, rien d'Exceptionnel mais j'ai bien accroché.Par contre qui dit grande salle dit BEAUCOUP de bruit. N'y allez pas pour discuter tranquillement avec quelqu'un car ce n'est pas cette ambiance. Sans pour autant dire que les gens crient ou font la fête mais c'est la somme de toutes les discussions qui fait ce brouhaha.Au niveau de la bière il y a une super carte. Que des microbrasseries et des supers choix. On a demandé à goûter les bières et on a pu ainsi choisir en connaissance de cause. Sur les 6 échantillons on a vraiment accroché sur 5. Cela prouve que la sélection est plus que propre si je puis dire !Les verres peuvent varier de 8 à 16oz suivant la bière que vous prendrez et le prix est de 6$ taxes incluse. Très satisfait de la qualité et de la sélection.Nous avons aussi pris des plats. Déjà les frites supers bonnes, vraiment bien accroché !J'ai pris des fajitas au poulet marinés qui étaient aussi très bonnes et bien assaisonnées. Servi soit avec frites soit avec salade. Le tout pour seulement 10$ :)Plusieurs plats sont passés et le fish n chip donnait vraiment envie, le morceau de poisson était juste énorme !!!! Le tartare de saumon avait l'air fort appétissant et en bonne portion pour 12$.Vraiment dur de faire son choix, il faudra y retourner pour tester d'autres choses :)En conclusion de part le choix de bière, de plat je ne peux que conseiller ce bar.Nous y retournerons de sur !

I had the pleasure of attending the YEE here recently.  I enjoyed the food and made plans then to come back.  I brought the wife along as like me she lives Asian cuisine.    We started out with the Siu Mai and Szechuan Dumplings.  The Siu Mai were tasty and seemed much larger than other places.  The dumplings were perfect and not too spicy.  For the main course we had the Pad Thai, Mongolian Beef and Wuhu Beef Fried Rice.  The Pad Thai was the least favorite thing we ordered.  The noodles were stuck together and it had a sour taste.  The Beef Fried Rice was very good.  Lots of great tasting beef paired with the tasty fried rice.  The Mongolian Beef was well prepared with tensor beef and veggies.  The sauce was a great compliment to the delicious dish.     We had some leftovers and added a few item for our daughter.   Got her the Tonkotsu Ramen, Walnut Shrimp and Pot Stickers.  She loved the Walnut Shrimp and Pit Stickers.  The Ramen was very good also as I gave it a try.  She didn't share the shrimp or pot stickers!     Being in a casino is kind of a problem for me as I don't care for the smoke walk to get to a restaurant.  The good thing is the Silverton is not that bad compared to many casinos.  The prices at Wuhu are very good and what you get will please your Asian food cravings.  They have a variety of food from all over Asia.  It is well prepared with fresh ingredients.  This is not a high end place but you get good food and it comes to your table pretty fast.  If I am in the area I will definitely come back.

Restaurant name  Bouchon Bakery at The Venetian

Review Text :
Generally speaking, I don't get cravings for sweets and desserts like how I do with  pho and ramen.  If I were to ever get the urge though, there's a pretty good chance it would be for a delicious, French macaron.  Well, other than ice cream of course.  Or a fresh, homemade chocolate chip cookie.  A thin one, with slightly crisp edges, a golden brown bottom, and a soft, chewy center with plenty of melted chocolate chips.  Yeaaaaahhhhh, that'd be good....wait, what was I talking about?While most French bakeries offer up smaller, near bite-sized macarons, I love how Bouchon's are almost the size of your palm.  Even though that means you pay a little more for each cookie, it also means you have that much more to enjoy.  And enjoy you will, with a light, crisp exterior sandwiching a sweet and chewy filling.  Although I've yet to try the Pistacio flavor myself, I've heard plenty of good things about it from friends.  For me, my favorite has been their Espresso Macaron - loaded with a rich, coffee flavor, it won me over after just one bite.Since this Bouchon Bakery is really more of an outlet/coffee stand in the Venetian (by the theater), the selection is smaller compared to what their actual "bakery" locations can offer.  However, it still tastes just as good, and that's what matters most, right?  After all, if you start to crave a macaron, it's better to be stuck choosing from just a few varieties than to not have any to choose from at all!After my dinner at B&B Burger where no dessert is offered, I walked around the corner to this little spot where I got a pumpkin tart.  The tart was very good and just what I'd expect from Bouchon.  The only problem with this small outlet near the sports book and clock tower is there is no place to sit.  It is almost entirely takeout.The tart was boxed which wasn't necessary.  I ended up removing the tart from the box and using one of their plastic forks to start eating the tart.  I soon gave up and picked it up and ate it like that.There's a water dispenser at the bar with the plasticware and sugars/creams for coffee, but it wasn't working.  After finishing, I went to the nearest bathroom in the casino to wash my hands.A great little pastry and a perfect end to a dinner somewhere else!

Decent lunch spot in DTLV. Restaurant itself is always clean and the cashier and cook are always very friendly and courteous. So far, I've tried the chicken, steak, carnitas, and barbacoa tacos, they're all equally delicious, but beware, barbacoa tends to make the tortillas soggy so if you order an assortment of different meats like I do, eat the barbacoa first.I always go with the taco special they have, which is a great deal. 4 tacos with beans, rice, and a drink for $8.99, service is always fast so I never have to wait long to receive my food, which is always a plus considering I only have a one hour lunch break. So if you're in the hood, definitely give Taco Rico a chance.

As part of a surprise birthday dinner we were indeed pleasantly surprised to be seated at la Petit Mort. There was a really warm welcome and we were very well taken care of. The girl serving us was extremely knowledgeable and could explain drinks and dishes to the finest detail, including little enticing morsels of flavour explanations. They serve a menu of 3 starter, mains and desserts. The highlight for myself was indeed the rare cooked flat iron steak. Perfectly cooked and extremely tender. Their cocktail list is a joy to read.They do offer a large range of classic cocktails made to measure and personal preferences. I was very pleased with my earl grey old fashioned (though I personally prefer the single large rock of ice)My biggest surprise was how reasonable the prices are compared to other places of similar quality (Kitchin, Scan & Scally et al) The food and service is certainly up to par. Sure these other places have won awards, but I did experience a similar (if not BETTER) experience in la Petit Mort - and as they are just starting out they may collect their rewards later on. Highly recommended and certainly worthy of revisiting often.

Review Text :
Sa Bai On The Fly- Oh My! On this dreary cold day I was in a spicy curry mood, and seeing all the great reviews for this restaurant piqued my interest in wanting to try it out. I ordered an avocado curry ($10) and Thai eggplant ($8). On the phone I was only offered "mild" or "medium" options of spiciness. Kind of odd, do they really not make things "hot" spicy? I went with the medium level and my order would be ready for pick up in 20 minutes.The order was ready right on time and packaged very well. It smelled amazing in the car, and it was a huge portion of food for each dish. The avocado dish is a jazzed up green curry with the addition of sliced and chunk avocados to the mixture of chicken, basil, and other vegetables. I think it was a good "medium" level of spiciness, just enough spice to let you know it was there without the need for a fire hydrant's worth of water afterwards. The Thai eggplant was a hefty portion of pork, eggplant, and other veggies and was more delicate tasting than the bold curry.The space inside the restaurant is nicely decorated but very tiny. In addition to ordering by phone, you can also order online through their website.Overall, I'd definitely be interested in coming here again to try more dishes.

LGO Hospitality does it again... I couldn't wait to try Buck & Rider, and now that I have, I can't wait to return!  This hot new seafood centric restaurant has only been open for a week, but you wouldn't know it based on our experience.My husband and I enjoyed an early dinner date night at newly opened B&R tonight and had a fun and memorable meal.  It's group service, but Mia was our main server and did a fabulous job!  We enjoyed sharing the following:-a half dozen oysters-snapper ceviche-lobster roll-calamariIt was all fresh and delicious, and paired perfectly with the glass of wine (Domaine Serge Les Boursicote Sancerre) I selected.  It's worth noting that they also offer a solid cocktail list for all of you cocktail connoseiurs ;)We sat inside but right on the border of the outdoor patio... We enjoyed an almost perfect view of Camelback mountain.  I say "almost perfect" as there is also a view of a Jack in the Box sign that gets in the way ;)The bathrooms are spacious, clean, and classy, as is the architecture of the restaurant; all fitting of the inspiration behind the space; a house located in a swanky beach town on the Australian coast.In addition to complimentary valet, B&R offers patrons LGO's signature sea salt chocolate chip cookies on your way out... it is the perfect sweet ending to your meal.  For now B&R is open for dinner only, 6 days a week (closed Monday).  I hope they will extend their hours into lunch soon.  This is definitely a welcome addition to the 'hood!

Let me start off by saying... it's not all their fault. And I'm going to start with what I liked. The food was really good. My husband had their special of the day. It was a Short Rib over Garlic Butter Grits. He said it was the best short ribs he has ever had, and the most tender. The Pub Burger was good! I liked how the bacon mixed in with the burger meat made it fall apart yummy. Everyone thought that The Deviled Eggs were WAYYYY too salty. If the salt was toned down a little it would have been much better, might have just been a bad batch. The Mac & Cheese bites were really good, both crunchy and gooey.  The beer selection was a nice selection of rotating crafter beers. The flights were priced pretty decently. Here is where my first -1 star comes in. I called not long after they opened and made a reservation for 9 people at 7:30 that night. The girl said "Let me check, put me on hold about 2 minutes. Came back and said "That should be no problem! Would you like outdoor seating or in door seating." I told her I think in-door would be best. She said "See you at 7:30."     My friend go there before me and was told that they had no reservation at 7:30 for a party of 9 under Ashley. So I came in and told them I had talked to a girl that morning that told me they even had room for inside or outside. I was then told "Well the girl that was working up front this morning went home sick. She is the one who probably took your reservations." Ok... and it's not in writing anywhere? I don't understand. And the staff seemed annoyed WITH ME!? How this is all my problem I do not understand.   So even after all of this me and my 8 friends decided to stay and wait for a table to open up. It was a Saturday night and every place was going to be a wait, due to Holiday parties. We went to the bar and got some beers and flights. The bar tender was very nice and patient with us, as some of my friends were not familiar with craft beers and had to do some sampling. After we were seated, everything went very smoothly. The service was nice, the food was good, and so was the beer. My Second -1 star is because the owner was there. I even heard him say he was going to wait on a table. In my experience, a manager/owner should have come to us and talked to us. Maybe apologized for what happened. I don't need anything for free, but at least come and speak with me. The only person who spoke with me about the entire thing was the young hostess. Who I felt bad for because its not her fault. I hope that a lot was learned from this mistake. However, I will be back. I really loved the atmosphere. Very chic, modern and a little bit rustic. It is very small but I don't mind that. When you walk in to the dining room you see what I think was about 8 or more long bench seats and bench type tables. Right behind those there's a Large Bar with lots of bar seating, both on the inside and outside of the bar. They had a cute little patio on the other side of the bar where we ended up sitting. They had heat lamps that worked very well and kept us pretty warm. A few lights and plants outside. I enjoyed a lot of things about this place. So I hope to come back and give this place 5 stars. But as of right now I am a little embarrassed and upset that I told my friends from out of town I had made these plans only to end up looking a little foolish. It ruined the experience a little bit.

When Shuseki closed it doors, I've waited to see what will pop up next to take its place. I was pleasantly surprised that another AYCE sushi joint finally emerged! The staff surprisingly reported it's the same owner of Sakana and Hwaro. Woot! Woot!I like the way the menu is set up. It's organized and the font size is easy to read. They truly revived the interior decor, but kept the dining areas the same set up as the previous restaurant. It's in the same plaza as Kaba Curry, Cafe Teaze, and Swish. This place gets a BIG PLUS for offering half rolls, allowing you to expand your options. The dinner price of $25.95 and lunch price of $20.95 are comparable to other AYCE sushi. There is a time limit. 80 min for dinner and 60 min for lunch. I am not going to bore anyone how the appetizers, skewers, and sushi tasted like ;) I think that each sushi restaurant has its own distinctive taste and with their own signature sauces. It's whatever floats your boat! You decide! LOL! The fish to rice ratio gets another great applause! I would definitely come back since I barely tasted the items on the menu.

Restaurant name  Hussong's Cantina

Review Text :
Though the name resonates with an upper middle aged crowd, this Summerlin eatery falls short in many categories and is simply not worth the time or money. Despite its rich long term history due to its namesake and original location, this restaurant seems like it just tries too hard to be hip and cool and ends up resembling something more like Carl's Jr. but lacking the cheap eats value. When you enter, you are asked to order from a counter. Then you can opt for "full service" where the waitstaff will supposedly check on you and refill your drinks. To opt for this service you must leave a CC at the counter to establish an open tab, regardless of whether or not you accrue additional charges. Then once you order, you are given a number and told your food will be delivered to your table. How they know who is "full service" and who isn't I have no idea and it didn't really matter anyway as we left a CC with them yet not ONCE did a waiter come by to offer refills or check on us. We left the table to refill our own drinks from the soda fountain and collect our CC prior to departure. The best value we experienced here was our lack of need to tip. Overall, the only reason I gave a 2 star instead of 1 is I did enjoy the overall aesthetics. The kitschy 80's and 90's era toys like Stay Puft Marshmallow man and PeeWee Herman doll were nostalgic and cute. But when it comes to the food and service, stick to Carl's Jr. At least when they deliver the food they usually ask if you need anything else. Hussong's could learn a few things from them.I hate to say it, but I like this place. Some may be turned off the the over-flare-ification of the interior or the high-priced Mexican fare (at least compared to hole-in-the-wall spots). But, the tacos and street corn won me over. The char and prominent cotija flavor of the former make it worth getting, especially when it's free for checking in. As for the tacos, the pork belly is my favorite. Balanced sweet and savoriness, varied texture with the cabbage mix and most importantly it was topped with chicharrones. What's not to like? The barbacoa was a close runner-up. Who cares if it was messy with its sauce dripping everywhere. It's still bold flavored and delicious. Less noteworthy, but still decent were the chicken tacos and carnitas. Taco platters come with two tacos, which you can mix-and-match. Rice and beans can be hit or miss. The first time around the rice was better than almost any rice I've tried at a Mexican restaurant -- light, fluffy and buttery. The second time around... not so much. Still, Hussongs is a worthy spot to hit up as long as you don't mind paying a little more for tacos.3.5 Stars

Argh... first impressions...Walked in the door around 8pm on a S-A-T-U-R-D-A-Y... NIGHT... and let me tell ya, it was hella loud son.  Like, The Metro nightclub in Riverside, three decades ago loud.  Like you have to yell at a girl to ask her to dance loud.  However, the iced tea was wonderfully tropical, and I should know, just coming from the tropics.I ordered the eggplant parm, because I love it, and can usually tell if a place is going to be good by how it turns out.  Fact: Carlo & Emilies has a great eggplant parm.  Even Buca has a pretty good eggplant parm... but not these guys.  It also came with fettuccine and red sauce, topped with a croissant.  Yeaaaah, like my mom used to make... from a canned sauce.Granted, I should walk away with a lesson learned, but I'll return to try the pizza... next time with earplugs.

Hot diggity dog!  A good hot dog place to replace my fave DD.If you like a plain dog or one of the specialties of the house, you won't be disappointed.  A great place to get a quick dog and take the kids.  I have had the Smokehouse with fries and was so pleased.  The menu includes a Mac & Cheese dog - oreo cheesecake squares - chicken and a veggie.  Only one small hightop table so it is really take out.  But if in the mood for a dog, this is the place!

This place serves unbelievable Hainin chicken rice and chicken wings.  I got both when I went.  The chicken rice matches perfectly cooked and deboned chicken (no taking shards out of your mouth) with fantastically seasoned rice.  It came with 3 dipping sauces.  All of the sauces would be fine just served with the seasoned rice but they took the chicken to another level.  Everyone just devoured our plates.Chicken wings might be even better.  I don't know what they put in the sauce but it was out of this world and the wings are slightly crispy on the outside and perfectly cooked on the inside.  I can't say enough good things about this place.I'm really shocked we have such a good Hainan chicken place here in Las Vegas.  No one else serves a halfway decent version of it.  And this is better than anything I've had in Taiwan and Los Angeles.My wishes have been granted and I no longer need to make a 4-5 hour drive to LA to go to Savoy Kitchen for my favorite Singaporean treat - Hainan Chicken and rice.This is hands down the best hainan chicken and rice I've ever had.  A few other places in town serve it but the quality, preparation, execution, and flavor don't come close to Flock.The chicken is silky smooth, moist.  Rice is fragrant with chicken essence.  I love pouring some of the rich broth over and the sauces are ridiculously good.   Love the ginger scallion and the chili packs a punch but you can then pair it with the sweet soy. The chicken wings are bursting with soulfulness - i used to work on this side of town- i wish I did bc I would be here 3-4x a week.  That's how much I love hainan chicken and rice.   Check out Anthony Bourdains Singapore trip to the hawker centers to see what this is all bout if you don't know about hainan chicken and rice.Jenny is one of the sweetest people in Vegas! Came in during their soft opening, and they have completely transformed the space. I really dig the textured wall paper, and the modern minimal decor with farmhouse accents.  Unfortunately, when I visited they were out of rice- I'll have to return to try their Hainan chicken dish, but I was thoroughly impressed with the items I did try, and Jenny's top-notch, friendly service.CHOPPED SALAD: Lettuce, kale, avocado, almonds, fried shallots, seasonal veg, and sesame vin. The dressing was light but flavorful, and the seasonal vegetables on this visit included red grapes and sweet plum tomatoes. It was a shockingly fresh and flavorful salad, and adding the fried chicken filet on top makes it a filling meal.TWICE COOKED SICHUAN CHICKEN WINGS: Available by the half or full pound, these are damn delicious. Slightly sticky, sweetly sauced, with great flavor. Definitely a win for Sheridan Su! I'd say these are a must-get item.I'll be back for their five-spice chicken bao and the Hainan chicken! Heads up that they close at 3:30PM, so this is exclusively a lunch spot. They also have very limited seating (4 2-tops and one 4-top), since the space is very small. Props for having ample (and comfortable) seating for takeout orders or waiting customers!I flocked to Flock & Fowl today because I have followed Chef Su and Jenny around town from Great Bao to Fat Choy to here and also the Lucky Rice Night Market thing when it debuted here.  They are a great team.  I freakin' love Hainan chicken rice and my main exposure to it was in Thailand.  I had some at a cheap place mentioned in Lonely Planet in Bangkok on my honeymoon, then again in the Bangkok Airways lounge in the Bangkok Airport, where I think I ate 8 plates of it (in 2011).  Fast forward to summer 2014 and Eric R. and I flew from Bali to Bangkok to Tokyo to the US.  We had a long layover in Bangkok (during the coup, and didn't tell anyone we were flying through there - the government shut off the a/c in the airport so I actually passed out)...first though we stopped at a random restaurant in the airport and I got Hainan chicken rice then passed out in the hot restaurant and then Eric R. dragged me to the gate to Tokyo where I passed out from the heat and exhaustion again.I do not know when I will actually get to Singapore (where this the national dish), Hainan, or Malaysia any time soon, so I am often on the hunt for this dish.  There are a few places that have it in town but...eh!  In the Little Apple where I live, we have a place that serves cao mun guy (Thai version of this dish) but the chicken is dry.This dish at Flock & Fowl.....well....the chicken is MOIST! and organic, free range fowl!  No foul here, just fowl.  It was so moist that it needed no sauce, seriously.  The rice was delicious and flavorful.  It was served with pickled mustard greens and cucumbers, broth, plus 3 dipping sauces made in house: sesame soy, ginger-scallion, and sambal.  I liked all of the sauces, and dipped my chicken in a random sauce every bite.  Then I drizzled the sauces on the rice.  I wanted an egg but the last one was ordered by the person before me = darn!  So I took a cab here from the Venetian because I was too impatient to wait for the Deuce.  Due to its location on Sahara with lanes only going westbound and a major accident southbound on Vegas Blvd., I decided to walk back.  Fueled by fowl, I flocked back to Caesars Palace where I returned to my conference, feet burning but tummy smiling.  I hope to come back when the restaurant is out of the soft opening.  I also had a green milk tea which Jenny made to order and adjusted sweetness to my taste (I guess I am a bitter gal because I like unsweetened, bitter green tea).  I am pretty fly for a fowl girl (I am what I eat)!  If only I could have flown from the restaurant to my destination.  Too bad I am leaving or I could go to a foot spa on Spring Mountain.  Flock to this place but be patient as the restaurant works out its opening.  According to Jenny, it is meant for take-out which is why there is limited seating and no public restroom.This is such a great place with great people - Sheridan and Jenny are so wonderful and hospitable! The menu is simple, but it's all you need to fulfill your poultry needs. They use Mary's free-range organic chicken for all their dishes. There's either poached chicken, fried chicken tenders, or chicken wings.Hainan Chicken Rice ($8.99): poached chicken and rice cooked in chicken fat with pickled cucumbers and mustard greens. Served with housemade soy, ginger scallion, and sambal sauces, and a side of chicken broth. I added a fried egg ($1.99) and Chinese sausage ($1.99). This dish is phenomenal. It's Asian comfort food at its finest. Every element is so wonderful. The chicken, the rice, and especially the housemade sauces. I had to get extra ginger scallion. Yum. I could eat this all the time.Mrs. Han's Twice-Cooked Szechuan Chicken Wings and Thai Style Chicken Wings: fish sauce, garlic, and lemon (1 pound, $7.99). Both extremely flavorful! Also, just really great wings. You get a cute metal bucket to put your bones.I'm definitely going back to try the other dishes, but the Hainan Chicken Rice is a must on every visit!Sheridan Su and Jenny Wong have done it again. Their success with Fat Choy is due to their great business sense and people skills: offer good food at affordable prices. Flock and Fowl just has more sophistication, shall I say. They are located at the same complex as Golden Steer. Currently, their business hours are limited. Seating is limited (about 5 small tables) but you can always take your food to-go instead. They have about 5 organic poultry menu items/combos. But the freshly made drinks and the Hainan chicken rice are the business!Hainan Chicken Rice:First of all, I'm not a big fan of chicken skin that is white. If it's not BBQ'ed, fried, baked, or roasted to a golden brown - I refuse to eat it. I avoid Hainan chicken rice at all costs...but not this time! I'd have to say, this is the first Hainan chicken rice I've ever liked. Ok so maybe, I removed the chicken skin but the sliced chicken pieces were juicy. You dip the chicken in sambal, garlic ginger or soy sauce...or maybe, all 3. Then, eat it with the fragrant and flavorful rice with mustard greens. 5/5Bao Chicka Bao Bao:A big hot juicy chicken tender in a bao (steamed bun) with kale and sauce. There's nothing quite like it. Soft bao + crispy kale and chicken. Yuuuummm!!! 5/5Lemon Tea:Refreshing and fragrant without being too tart. Jenny makes a fresh batch from scratch as needed. 5/5Milk Green Tea:If you want a somewhat richer kind of drink, this is a good option. It's floral and slightly creamy. 4.5/5Jenny can make adjustments to your drink if you want it sweeter, more tart, etc. They're genuinely nice. They remember customers' names. They take time to chat with you.I have been to Chef Sheridan Su's Fat Choy restaurant in the Eureka Casino and I was intrigued when I learned that he opened a new place with a very limited menu of Hainan chicken and four other items.Six of us decided to meet for lunch yesterday and it would give me the chance to try the Hainan chicken about which I've read so much.We were served everything on the menu.  As it only contains 5 things plus a few à la carte items, everything was enough and very good.We started with fried chicken bao with kale pea sprout slaw.  The chicken was excellent, breaded just right, and with the slaw and the soft bao, it made one great sandwich.Next came two orders of chicken wings--one of Thai caramel and one called Mystery wings which are Szechuan style wings.  I had one of each.  I liked the Szechuan wings better but I'm not a chicken wing fan.  Generally when I order wings, I get boneless wings which aren't wings at all.  It's the messy fingers syndrome I don't like.Then we were served a Flock & Fowl salad with Cornish game hen pieces.  I had some salad but I didn't try the hen.  Last, we were brought two dishes--one with the Hainan poached chicken for which this place has become known and one with fried chicken tenders and rice.  Both dishes come with three sauces, ginger scallion, house made chile, and house made soy.  Both dishes come with rice and marinated cucumbers and preserved mustard greens.  The Hainan chicken comes with a cup of broth.  These dishes are excellent!!  The Hainan chicken is moist and delightfully boneless and the dipping sauces add to the taste of the chicken.  The tenders are excellent!This is a must return to place.  The bao, the tenders, and the Hainan chicken are all worthy of having again!  A couple of tips:  this is a lunch only restaurant open from 10:30-3:30.  It's a small place seating just 16 people so you may have a wait.  This is in a small strip mall on West Sahara near the freeway on the north side of Sahara.  Chef Su and Jenny Wong are most gracious people and you'll enjoy your stop here!Items Selected:Hainan Chicken Rice - Poached Chicken, Rice, House Sauces with added Chinese SausageFried Tenders and RiceChicken Wings - Mrs Han's Twice Cooked SzechuanChicken Wings - Thai Style with Fish Sauce, Garlic, and LemonCornish Game Hen with Kale, Tomato, Cucumber, Grape, Cranberry, Sunflower Seeds, Almonds, and Sesame Vinaigrette SaladBao-Chicka-Bao Bao with Kale SlawAchieving unlikely success in the middle of Eureka Casino with his Great Bow-turned-Brick+Mortar Fat Choy, Sheridan Su has seemingly found success where so many others have failed largely by keeping head down, eyes up, while focusing on quality of the product, and narrowing his focus even further at recently opened Flock & Fowl the young Chef finds has proven the rare double threat with a "do one thing and do it well" space that gets it right.Historically an adapted dish of early Chinese decedents from the Hainan Province, but offered throughout Asia and a few famous shops speckled around the United States, Su and his wife Jenny officially started obsessing over the dish following a visit to Taiwan and although a recipe of poached chicken and rice cooked in chicken fat may seem 'simple,' its perfection lies in the details - all of which the duo seems to have dialed in.No more fanciful in location than Fat Choy. the renovated space on Sahara next to a pawn shop and within view of the Strip Clubs on Industrial Road in the shadow of The Strip, Flock & Fowl seems as intentionally limited in its seating as it is in its menu and with Sheridan in the Kitchen as Jenny works the room orders are placed at the counter with service fast to follow, a "one of each" order seeing our table of six served in three successive rounds.Starting with Sheridan's longtime signature buns, in this case graced with crispy buttermilk soaked bird from Mary's Free Range with a bit of kale slaw and sauce, it almost seems silly that anyone could be excited about the pending opening of Chick-fil-A with such a thing available, each bite first met by pillowy bao before giving way to bittersweet flavors juxtaposing juicy, well-seasoned meat.Rare to be wowed by wings, though always open to a change of heart, round two saw Sheridan send out a couple extra bites of each flavor to that the whole table could enjoy, and with two flavors available the only real question is which of them to order, the Szechuan expectedly the 'hotter,' though certainly not ridiculous, while the fish-sauce tossed Thai style rivaled those at Pok-Pok for flavor, if not for size.Served all three entrees at once, easily enough to feed six adults when paired with that which had already come, suffice it to say that the Chicken tenders were perfectly fine if not particularly 'wowing' compared to the rest, yet when paired to the housemade chile sauce or chunky bits of garlic the three-piece order was an absolute steal for just $9, the crispy cornish hen another veritable steal alongside a complex and elegant salad for just a dollar more.Speaking last to the dish Su set out to perfect it should first be said that many at the table had never sought out a truly authentic version until this date, but whether a virgin or a veteran none at the table seemed to be disappointed in the silky broiled breast or the fluffy white rice, a $2 addition of spicy Chinese sausage every bit worth the surcharge while the bonus broth was chock-a-block full of flavor without being pumped up with salt or MSG.****Flawed only in the inherent limitations of space, an outsourced single dessert, and menu -  the later to be remedied by specials from time-to-time - Flock & Fowl has thus far shown that perhaps Las Vegas is ready to embrace such a focused concept - the early word almost universally favorable, but a fate that only time and the fickleness of local 'media' will tell.I had lunch recently with friends at Flock & Fowl, which from what I have read of the few reviews posted at the time, is all about their authentic preparation of Hainan Chicken Rice.  The restaurant is on a small stripmall lot on Sahara, and very close to Las Vegas Blvd and SLS.  I can see parking potentially be a problem, but there should be plenty of street parking on the side street.  It is a very small restaurant with very limited seating, so if you plan to go during your lunch break, go early and beat the crowd. Or expect to wait or have it prepared as a takeout.So what exactly is Hainan Chicken Rice, aka Hainanese Chicken Rice (海南雞飯)? It is considered one of the national dishes of Singapore, and is very popular in Vietnam and Thailand as well.  But it is based on a dish called Wen Chang Chicken (文昌雞) from the Southern Chinese province of Hainan (海南).  And each country that adapted this popular and tasty dish from early Chinese immigrants from Hainan put their own regional spin on it.  I have tried a few variations already (Taiwan, Thailand and Singapore), and as long as the chicken is cooked and still moist, it is already considered good by my book.The variation prepared and served at Flock & Fowl is one of the better ones for sure.  The chicken is moist and paired well with the fluffy white rice cooked with chicken fat (this might be the first time I have tried this variation, as I am more accustomed to the rice being cooked with chicken broth, which gives it more chicken flavor) and the homemade sambal chile sauce and the ginger scallion sauce.  For diners looking for a simple and healthful meal option, this is definitely a good choice.  Additional add-ons are available, such as egg and chinese sausage, which I think will make your dining experience even better.Even though Flock & Fowl is a small restaurant with a very modest number of tables and seats (I counted about 20), with a very small menu of 3-5 items, it should still be on every Yelper's radar of places to try.  I really enjoyed my experience at Flock & Fowl, and I think you will too.I might not have given five stars based on the food alone. Fortunately, I had much more to go on.Flock & Fowl is the newest venture by chef Sheridan Su of Fat Choy (and previously Great Bao and whatnot), and it's located in a strip mall off Sahara between the Strip and the highway. The food is quite good, as I'll detail momentarily. But if his wife Jenny Wong is there running the show and making you feel at home, you're in for a great experience. She remembers everyone's name, explains menu items at the register or when bringing them to your table, and is generally a master of service.Orders are placed at the window, with menus available on the board below the counter or in the frames on the side wall (with daily specials clipped on the side, which I failed to notice until the end). After paying, you can grab one of the few tables, assuming it's not packed for lunch rush (which I avoided having wisely arrived early), or take your order to-go. It doesn't seem wise to wait on the fried items though.Of the two types of chicken wings on the menu ($4.99 for 4, $7.99 for 8), they only had the Thai Caramel today. Maybe I'll try the Mystery Wings eventually, but I really can't remember having more delicious chicken wings than the Thai Caramel, even considering the best batches of my dad's homemade wings. These wings are large, juicy, and slathered with a potent sauce. Jenny described it as lemony, fish saucy, and garlicky, and it's all of those flavors along with a wings-appropriate level of sweetness.. Best wings ever? Dunno. Destination-worthy? Absolutely.Next, I had the Night Market Fried Chicken Bao ($3.79 for 1, $6.99 for 2). With a huge boneless piece of buttermilk fried chicken, kale, daikon sprouts, mustard greens, and sauce, it's at or near the level of Chef Sheridan's legendary pork belly bao (at Fat Choy). The delicious fried exterior makes up for what initially felt like a slightly underseasoned interior, and the accoutrements round out of the flavors and textures. Not that the chicken lacks any crunch or juiciness on its own. The bun did feel a little stretched, but it's a sufficient vessel for the goodness within.Finally, I got to my entree, the Hainanese Chicken Rice ($8.99) with additional Chinese sausage ($1.99) and chicken broth ($0.25). Tender, juicy boiled chicken with moist chicken fat rice are the basis, and some mustard greens and lightly pickled cucumbers are available on the side, but the overall flavor profile would feel slightly lacking without the Chinese sausage.Chicken isn't known for its intrinsic flavor, and while the spicy sambal sauce and the soy sauce are good, the ginger scallion sauce lacks all of the ubiquitous ginger kick. Also, the house-made broth did have rich chicken flavor, but it suffered greatly from lack of salt. Fortunately, the nearly fatal flaw seems to be masked by pouring it all over the rice and then adding sauces. It's not a perfect dish, so I wouldn't necessarily agree with the Signature Dish of the Year award recently bestowed upon it by the Desert Companion magazine, but I can see myself ordering it again, especially because the leftover portion grew on me.I also tasted my friend's Flock and Fowl Salad w/ Cornish Game Hen ($9.99). The salad was very impressive, with ingredients such as cranberries, avocado, pomegranate seeds, and tomatoes over fresh lettuce. As for the hen, I'll have to reserve judgment because I tried it without the accompanying salt and Szechuan pepper mixture, and it seemed lacking on its own.Lest you think that food is the only worthwhile type of consumable here, they have a good selection of iced and hot teas and coffees, available sweetened or unsweetened. I went to the "premium" section of the beverage menu for the freshly steeped jasmine green tea ($5). Jenny brought out the pot then poured in the boiling water, and you can take the leaves out and place it into a tiny metal bucket whenever you'd like the arrest the steeping process. I found that the first batch was very fragrant, but the jasmine scent was significantly muted in a second steeping of the same leaves. I did eventually find enough jasmine flavor, such that it dwarfs most jasmine teas that you'll find. but don't be surprised if there's a drop-off if you re-up.As I said before, service was terrific. At the end of the meal, Jenny brought us to-go boxes and bags, complimentary sauce to-go upon request, and a complimentary second helping of boiling water plus a to-go cup without request. It's technically not full service, but that's a technicality based on where you place your order. It's definitely the best service in recent (or any) memory.Flock & Fowl is only open for lunch (10:30-3:30) on Tuesday through Saturday so far, but it's a must-try for the Thai Caramel wings and for the hostess. Its location is accessible enough for tourists and just remote enough for locals, so unless you're a vegetarian, you really have no excuse not to stop by.A near perfect taste of Singapore's national dish for under $9 (Hawaii yeeps add $600 supplement and 5.5hrs of flying).  That's a savings of $13,700 (hey, if you're going to Singapore, you gotta fly Suite Class right?)Simply put, this is an authentic, closest tasting Hainanese chicken rice to the hawker stands of Singapore.  Boneless, tender, moist, not fatty pieces of chicken with a very pronounced chickeny flavor served with rice cooked in a rich chicken stock.  Add a whatever portion of dark soy, grated ginger and scallion oil, and fiery chili sauce before spooning the entire bite into your eagerly awaiting mouth.  Then, wow. Being so chickeny is helped along by the chicken is free range and cooked in a mother stock that is perpetually maintained (based on how this chicken taste, this is definitely the case).Four other items round out the menu, all chicken of course.  The "Hainan Fried Chicken Rice", good.  Moist, breaded, deep fried chicken tenders.  What's not to love.  The "Night Market Fried Chicken Bao", the same deep fried chicken in a bun (Chinese not hamburger), with hoisin, sesame seeds, and greens makes a nice starter but nothing compares to the chicken.As others have mentioned, this is a very small restaurant.  Go at opening or expect a wait.Service is mom and pop, family friendly.Vegas rocks out yet another serious Asian food find.

When you're located in the same block as Weera Thai, you're going to have a hard time if your kitchen isn't up to par- the dining room is nice and going for a more upscale vibe, but they have cheap ($7) weekday lunch specials. But unfortunately the food just wasn't up to par for me.FISH CAKES APP: 5/$10 Small, oily, and a bit bland. I enjoyed the cucumber dipping sauce but this didn't pop needed a hit of acidity or something.PAPAYA SALAD: BF requested this and devoured the entire portion. Sauce was slightly spicy, did not like the half-frozen green beans used though.CRAB FRIED RICE: This was listed on the board as a daily special. Portion was large enough, and I like that the extra bit of attention and effort were put into presentation even though this was a takeout order. However, I asked for a spice level of 5 (on their 1-10 scale) and this had no spice whatsoever. I ended up dumping two cups of chili paste and some red pepper flakes into the dish to give it some heat. It's a huge pet peeve of mine to be asked for a spice level and then not even take it into account when cooking the dish. It was even on the receipt so I'm not sure who dropped the ball.Located in a blink-and-you'll-miss-it spot on Sahara next door to a leather goods shop, it's not necessarily a place I'll return- the food was fine, but didn't have anything about it to stand out from the sea of other thai places on the block.

It's been a while since I had a good pizza outside of little Italy. Opened a little over a week ago. Have to say the atmosphere it's quite pleasant. Has this bar feel to it and they brought back some of the 80s look with the old stereo, cassette box and old school phone. The staff was amazing and service super friendly. If ur a fan of thin pizza with a fantastic crust, this is a must!! I had the mushroom pizza and  wow! It's packed with all kinds of flavours. The first slice was all about trying to figure out the flavours. Sweet, salty, basil, types of mushrooms, and that crust! After that first slice I inhaled the rest.. The this pizza actually melts in your mouth..Margherita pizza  was was my other choice and lived it too. Flavours were a little more subtle. The cheese just oozing and the basil makes all the difference. Oh and that crust !! I'm one to always leave the crust behind but not this time. This place is a must go try.. And I'll keep wanting more. If u you're one not to eat the crust I dare you not to on this pizza!

Review Text :
This was my first visit to a Cafe Zupas and I have to say it is decent for what it is.I wasn't in love with my panini and neither was my mom so I will probably steer clear of those in the future and just stick to regular sandwiches, soups and salads.My mushroom bisque was delightful. Creamy and rich with the right amount of mushrooms. I would come back just for soup when I'm in the mood again.The only thing I didn't care for was the restaurant layout. All the chairs ere huddled so closely together it made it pretty difficult for people to navigate around the restaurant since there was no clear path to the ordering line, trash or drink station. Everyone kept bumping into one another and it became quite irksome. Since they just recently opened I'm sure these are small tweaks that can be made to improve as they learn. The staff is all very new as well and it was slightly more difficult to order than it should've been given the fact that I had to repeat my order three separate times as I moved down the line. Might be a little easier if I could just say it once and someone could write it down. Not too hard for ordering one item but when I was trying to remember what everyone in my party wanted every time I had to repeat the entire order it became harder to recall with each subsequent interaction. Otherwise a decent quick eat spot for bites on the go.So I noticed some fellow Yelpers checking in here and since it just down the street from me just had to try it.  I love deli food and the thought of another good deli near me was too much to pass up on.  We each got a soup and sandwich combo and a couple of salads. I had the Turkey Bacon Avocado with the Wild Mushroom Soup.  The wife got the BBQ Pork with the Lobster Bisque and the daughter got the Crab Sandwich with the Cauliflower soup.   The Wild mushroom was very good.  Creamy and with those amazing tasty mushrooms.  It was exactly what I expected.  The Turkey Bacon Avocado sandwich was also very good.  The bread was still crisp and the turkey and bacon were pretty tasty.  It had a decent amount of avocado which was prefect as it added to the overall taste but didn't turn the sandwich into a mushy mess.  I did try the Lobster Bisque and Cauliflower soups and they were both very good.  The Lobster Bisque was chunky with more lobster than I expected.  I would definitely order it again.  The Cauliflower soup was creamy and surprisingly delicious.  I did not think I was going to like it but hey you just never know sometimes.  I did get  taste of the crab sandwich and it was pretty good too and would gladly order it again.  I didn't try the BBQ Pork sandwich but according to the wife it was nothing to write home about.  She said it was OK.  We got the Mango and Asian Chicken salads and although they were good I don't think they are a good value so I will stick with Soup and Sandwiches next time.      Since they had just recently opened I am not sure if the inside was done but it had a very casual feel to it.  I would call it modern industrial but hey I am no designer so not sure what they are going for as far as looks.  The staff was super friendly but too plentiful.  I would assume this is due to recently opening and doing OJT with new employees.  I ill be back but wait a month or so to see how this place matures.  A good addition to Rainbow and the SW of Vegas.

A little disappointed I stopped by WaBa Grill today for lunch. I thought I  would give WaBa Grill a try after reading so many positive reviews.WaBa Grill is  nice, clean and bright. I was  greeted as I entered the restaurant and the staff was very friendly. I placed my lunch order and sat down, and my entree was prepared quickly. On this visit I ordered a steak bowl with white rice and an ice tea.  I have to be honest my entree was not very good. The beef was tough, the rice was over cooked, and I did not particularly care for the sauce.I will probably revisit WaBa Grill in the near future and maybe try a different entree and see how that is.

I joined six friends to try this new restaurant in Aria.  We ordered:Double order of Caesar saladAssorted baked clamsFoie grasFettuccini con funghiSpicy rigatoni vodkaSpaghetti JulienMeatballsVeal parmesan Chicken ScarparielloLasagna verdeBananas flambéeCarrot cakeWe were started with two types of bread and each got a piece of parmigiano-reggiano.  We were given menus and then we waited.  It was approximately 45 minutes from sitting down and getting menus until our order was taken.  The captain was busy with other tables and other things and we just waited.  After ordering, it was not long until the first items came out.  The good items of the meal were the Caesar salad, the foie gras, the spaghetti Julien, and the carrot cake.  The Julien had a very good mixture of flavors that was interesting and quite tasty.  However, there was not one pasta that was cooked anywhere near al dente.  Everything was overcooked something I wouldn't expect from a neighborhood Italian restaurant let alone one in a major Strip hotel.The poorest example for a dish was the lasagna verde at $75.  It is a large container.  It's cut and served by the captain.  The dish, however, was ruined by the burnt top.  Evidently it was put under a broiler to brown the top but someone blackened part of the top and it permeated every taste I took of my share.  As soon as I tasted the lasagna I said, "This doesn't taste good."  When our group doesn't finish everything on every serving plate--and the last piece of lasagna was not finished--you know something is wrong.  We finish dishes.  Not burnt ones, however.The room was quite loud.  It was very crowded and the noise from conversations filled the room.  The music was great.  It was from my era--basically from 1955 to 1965.  From the 45 minute wait, one can tell that service was a little lacking.  One thing that hit me wrong in the beginning happened when the captain was going over the specials.  He held a box with two large white truffles and he waved one of Carbone's rather large menus over the truffles so we could get the rich smell of the truffles.  I thought it was very patronizing.Two of us at my side of our round table had a blast of cold air coming down on us throughout the meal.  We both wore our jackets for much of the meal.  Having spent $100 including tip, I felt more than a bit disappointed.  There are so many very good Italian restaurants on and off the Strip that are doing better cooking than this and charging less.  Fool me once!Items Selected:Semolina BreadGarlic Bread and Pizza FocacciaSpicy PepperoniMarinated CauliflowerPeccorinoBaked ClamsFoie Gras VenezianaCaesar alla ZZTagliatelle with Shaved White TrufflesSpicy Rigatoni VodkaSpaghetti JulianFettuccine con FunghiOff-Menu MeatballsLasagna VerdeVeal Parmesan Chicken ScarparielloCarrot Cake with Ginger IcingBananas FlambeeRainbow CookiesLimoncelloHaving watched Carbone open to gratuitous fanfare from more than a dozen writers and industry folks the New York import had knowingly comped, it was not until I was able to gather a group large enough to properly sample the pricy Aria restaurant that I hazard to make a reservation, the results of a nearly three-hour meal with six friends far less impressive than any of the 'media' will openly pronounce.No doubt a splashy space, the original channeled for much of the lavish design and showy tableside service from Captains shining in red, Carbone is the brainchild of Rich Torrisi and Mario Carbone and famous for high prices for traditional "red sauce" classics the Las Vegas iteration raises the stakes even higher than the Manhattan original, a $64 Veal Parm and $75 Lasagna a mere tip of the iceberg on a menu with prices not displayed out front.Clearly trying to evoke an dining environment rare to be found in Las Vegas in the year 2015, entrance to Carbone begins at a podium of smiling young faces in front of a painting of Christopher Walken and with Rat Pack classics playing a bit too loudly overhead those with reservations are quickly whisked through an elegant lounge to one of three large rooms, the center featuring circular enclaves and several large tables with a central chandelier that speaks volumes about the restaurants intentions and unrepentant opulence.Championing the slogan "every table deserves a captain," a concept is inherently flawed by tableside shows preventing him from appropriate steering the backstaff flow of traffic, it was nearly forty-five minutes holding enormous menus close like blankets that passed before orders were finally taken, and somehow avoiding to topple unused wine glasses while reaching for a complimentary selection of antipasti the first bites of the meal would actually prove to be some of the best and most interesting, the acid-splashed cauliflower simple yet refreshing while cured meat alongside three breads were all quite delicious, the saucy focaccia particularly quite addictive.Breaking the menu down into four-courses, though presentations of five plates requiring a show saw things slightly more staggered, round one included nine baked clams in 3x3 preparation alongside two steaks of foie gras amidst onions plus sauteed peppers and although the former proved a bit unwieldy for sharing while the liver was unctuous and well portioned, all attention was drawn to the tableside preparation of ZZ's Caesar's, a $42 double-order highlighted by the buttery croutons and sardines that was otherwise quite standard.Taking macaroni recommendations from a Public Relations executive and adding in personal preferences plus the anecdotal experience of others, course two featured four different pastas along with seven off-menu meatballs, only the $150 White Truffle Tagliatelle proving appropriately cooked al dente as thinner noodles bordered on 'mushy,' the meatballs no better or worse than would be expected for six dollars each...and certainly not enough to compensate for the uni-tinged Julian's great flavor being marred by such a failure in execution.Onward to entrees, the Chicken Scarpariello suggested by a local Italian restauanteur undoubtedly performing the best of any savory as spicy sausage provided a decadent nest for the juicy half-bird, those enticed by the famous fried Veal Chop will be happy to know that the $64 tab is mostly justified by both size and virtually perfect execution, the same not to be said of a $75 loaf of lasagna far too heavy handed with green peppers beneath a top that was actually too bitter to be enjoyable as a result of being burned.Enjoying the company and conversation far more than the food as the clock inched toward ten it was finally with the dessert cart parked tableside that a concluding duo was selected and treated to fudgey Rainbow Cookies and complimentary Limoncello as we watched bananas flambeed tableside it was with good fortune that both the boozy fruit over ice cteam and curl of carrot cake succeeded where other plates had failed, each textbook in execution and large enough to share at comparative bargain of just fifteen dollars.** Admittedly early in its Las Vegas lifespan and no doubt a place that will drum up tourist dollars and praise from the press to whom prices and service are tilted to please, Carbone offers a unique dinning experience compared to anything else currently on The Strip, yet failing in several basics of execution from kitchen to captain it simply is not nearly as great as it currently seems to believe.

Every time I come here, I sing Brass Monkey to myself the entire walk from my car to the door. And also sometimes in the bathroom. RIP MCA. I don't see how you can't like this place. Beer. Bottles and drafts. A ton of it. All of it. Changing taps with the seasons and what not. I mean, I got an adult root beer float. Do I really need to say anything else? That's right, Not Your Father's RB on draft the last two times I've been here. Warning: drink your float quickly or it will overflow. Don't like beer? They have cocktails and wine as well. Our good friend Billy M wanted two things for his birthday: dinner and great beer. So, we came here on a Thursday night. Nailed it. Our server was fantastic. We had people coming in and out joining us. He never skipped a beat. Seriously, if this guy isn't employee of the month then he's getting robbed. I ordered the prime rib sandwich with a side of mac n cheese. Note: the mac n cheese has bacon and green onions on top. Oh, and it's freaking delicious that way. Billy got a pizza with pretzel crust. Oh yes, pretzel crust. Our table also did pretzel bites, spin dip, bacon cheeseburger flatbread, an All American burger, and the buffalo chicken wrap. Another side item note: they have waffle fries. Everyone really liked their food. I devoured my entire sandwich, poor thing didn't stand a chance. There's a good amount of TVs for all your sporting needs. The patio is a pretty good size and they use heaters when it's cold. A ton of great specials throughout the week, including happy hour food specials. Two dollar tacos on Tuesdays. Boo-freaking-yah. Spoiler alert: they are really good. My favorite is the fist because I love peppadew peppers. You can get a couple tacos and a margarita for less than $10. Tuesdays are also game night, trivia on Wednesdays. Until next time Brass Tap, Brass Monkey, that funky Monkey. Brass Monkey junkie. That funky Monkey....

Get yourself to Sushi Hiroyoshi post-haste! This space has undergone a complete transformation since it's days as Sushi Yamaguchi- the formerly messy, cave-like space is now clean, open, and modern. Quality and service are stellar, and I place them on par with a lower-priced Kabuto. APPETIZER TRIO: Chef's choice of three different featured apps for the day. Ours were a tofu-uni dish, a seared tuna, and a cucumber-jellyfish salad, all of which were delicious. This first dish really set the tone for the beautiful presentation and careful balance of flavors we would experience throughout our meal.RED MISO: A comforting alternative to the usual (white) miso soup, with tofu and mushrooms.SCOTTISH SALMON TARTARE: Fresh fish, avocado, salmon roe, and spicy miso sauce, again with nice presentation. It may be helpful to ask for a spoon for this dish.NIGIRI: Super fresh. Go with any recommendations you receive. Had great masu, Hamachi, akami, ika, and (an especially amazing) hotate on our first visit. Everything was of great quality, and large thick pieces with lightly-vinegared perfectly-formed rice. TORO TAKU: Maki-style roll with fatty tuna, scallions, pickled daikon, and bonito flakes. Possibly our favorite item tried on our first visit. Simple but wonderful.UNA KYU: Maki-style roll with golden eel and cucumber. Savory and enjoyable.FLASH ROLL: One of the few somewhat-Americanized rolls on the menu, in five large pieces with salmon, tuna, yellowtail, avocado, and masago in soy paper. BF really enjoyed this.I can't fully express what a gem this place is. Space is small, seating a maximum of 30. Service is attentive and personable, even if seats at the bar aren't available. Fish freshness and quality was much higher than location led me to expect, with generous cuts and proper rice ratio. Dishes and quality were comparable to what we received on a recent trip to Kabuto, at half the price (though none of the grilled dishes). I live dangerously close to this spot and it will be hard to try new places with this spot right outside my backdoor.TIP: Lunch menu features a daily bento and sashimi combo, both exceptionally well-priced.

Korean food open late. My type of place! They serve bar food type dishes like wings and skewers in addition to more traditional dinners. We had the dduk kochi/rice cake in red pepper sauce, chicken gizzards, and spicy pork. The dduk kochi texture was superb, with a lightly crispy exterior to contrast with the soft chewy interior. The spicy pepper sauce was slightly too sweet for me but I loved the spicy kick from it. The chicken gizzards were... well, gizzards. The texture was very chewy but they were well seasoned and came with a side of hot sauce and sesame sauce. The spicy pork was tender and flavorful with mushroom, onion, and broccoli.Drinks were refilled as needed and we were checked up on frequently.The only annoyances were:1. No banchan offered prior to or with our meals.2. We were not given chopsticks but everyone else around us got them. Come on guys! Just because I'm speaking English to my husband doesn't mean I don't know how to use chopsticks!Overall though I'll be back again to try some more dishes.

Wish I didn't have to leave a rating because I do understand that it's their grand opening (aka they've only been open for a little while.) But unfortunately, I think it should be a soft opening since they didn't have a lot of items on the menu. My body was so ready to dine at a decent kbbq in Vegas since there are really none worth mentioning around here/worth the price lol.I was taken by surprise with the items that they had because they had Cajun fries!!!!!!!!! But of course, they didn't have it :-( They also didn't have gyoza, tofu, or any teas. Meats are ok, but to me... the Cali locations taste a lot better. I love love love the garlic pork belly, but for some reason it just had a weird after taste lol. Brisket was pretty dry as well, even when we tried to cook it medium. What I did like was that they serve Japchae in big portions!!!! My fav. The KFC Chicken was pretty good too, a little too saucy, but still good. The service is A1, they try their best. I've been to two of the locations in Cali & this one just disappointed me a little. But I hope the employees don't get discouraged because you are all doing the best you can & I see the hard work you all are putting in :-) Customers should understand that it's the grand opening and should be a little nicer to the workers for things they have no control of! I know this place will do well though because there aren't many kbbq places in Vegas and Gen is pretty well known. GG LV.A sight for sore eyes here in Henderson! (Especially for those SoCal peeps that crave KBBQ like I do sometimes)The recently opened Gen is at the Galleria at Sunset mall in Henderson. The restaurant is not attached to the mall however. It is located directly to the left of the main mall entrance. I have been long awaiting a good KBBQ joint since I moved to Vegas. And as luck would have it, it just opened in Henderson!I visited the second day of opening so things were still being kicked into gear with the staff and service so I can forgive some blips that we had like missed orders and the waitress dropping a glass of water on my friend. (ooops)The AYCE menu is extensive and very reasonably priced imo. $14.95 for lunch (open-3pm) and $19.95 (3pm-close)! Appetizers are included in the price as well. The lunch menu is the same as the dinner menu with a few 'premium' items left off. Of note, I really enjoyed the chadol (beef brisket), beef tongue, spicy rice cake, garlic pork belly and agedashi tofu! Granted, there wasn't anything I didn't like, but you get the idea. They were missing the pineapple steak from the menu, however. And I wasn't a huge fan of their side dishes :( There is no rice paper here but they do give you thin radish slices to wrap everything in!They also serve alcoholic beverages but I didn't indulge this time around. The parking is also plentiful in the mall lot. The decor is very swanky and modern which I enjoyed and there is greattttt ventilation (which my KBBQ veterans will know is very very important)It's a great addition to Henderson and Vegas and excited to have a place to satisfy my KBBQ/meat cravings now :OHow about a review written by a customer, and not a staff member? Don't believe me, check out Brian K's profile. Yelping since 2012, and two reviews? Also, his profile links to his Facebook, which shows he works at Gen Korean BBQ House.Enough about their gaming the system, to artificially inflate the ratings for this new Korean BBQ joint in Henderson. My wife and I were unsure where to go, as she is half Korean, we eat at a LOT of Korean BBQ places, in Vegas, and on the road. Galleria's newest food additions all look amazing from the outside, and this place was busy for a Monday night! The check-in process was great, you give a #, they text you your progress in queue. We were seated, and had the standard corporate greeting, "Is this your first time eating here with us? Oh, great, let me explain..." of course it is, you have only been open a couple days. Our server had minimal knowledge of the food, but brought out our drinks rather quickly. And then, a second person came to bring our drinks out. Overly efficient, or inept duplication?Our food was ordered, after being told there is a two hour time limit for the AYCE foods. The menu looked like there was a wide selection of options. Our first round of meats came out, and only two of them were right.So, they brought out 2x the drinks, and 50% wrong food to start. My wife ordered edamame, and was brought out a salad. When they delivered the meats, they gave my wife her boneless Kalbi rib type option, and put down some thinly sliced meat, and said it was spicy pork. They dropped off chicken and what they said was bulgogi to me.Spicy pork is coated in a red paste, but she gave it a try, just in case. It was beef bulgogi. When correcting it, they took the beef bulgogi, and brought out spicy pork. What they told me was bulgogi was pork. It took a while to get the right food brought out, after having our server tell me that beef turns white, depending on the marinade used. Ummmm. No. Pork turns white, beef turns brown, please try again. That got straightened out, thanks to a California trainer.  As to the flavor... the chicken bulgogi tasted like burnt soy sauce, and the beef bulgogi was just flavorless mush.After that... We only saw our server as he spent 20+ minutes chatting with a guy two tables over. Other tables around us were heard asking random employees, "Who is our server?!" We waited, and waited to pay. Finally, we just got up and went to the hostess. They aren't supposed to get our check for us, but did. Upon giving them a quick rundown of how our visit went, they got the GM. He is a very nice guy, who took our feedback, as a manager should, and said he would address the issue with his staff.I've waited a long time for a restaurant opening near Galleria / Sunset Station that I can really get excited about. Well, I'm finally excited.This is Gen Korean BBQ's 12th location, but they're a chain due to its success, not for being "chain restaurant" quality. This one is in the Galleria Mall building but not directly connected to the mall. It's near Red Robin and Larsen's, but it's at a higher elevation than Bravo.I actually ate for free (+tip) due to their public grand opening promo. It fell within dinner hours, which normally costs a very reasonable $19.95 for all you can eat (AYCE). The AYCE lunch is even more affordable at $14.95 and still includes everything except items #7, #8, and #10 (see below).This may be AYCE, but expect good-quality meats from the kitchen each time you order. Each table is allowed to up to 4 appetizers and 4 meats (8 total) per order. If you have 3-4 people in your group, go for it. But if you're solo or have one companion, don't do this! The time limit is two hours (not flaunted since the place wasn't packed), and you can order as often as you want, so order just a few dishes at a time so that everything is as fresh as possible. On a related note, don't cook all of your meats all at once if you're solo...Some AYCE KBBQ joints have an employee cook or at least start your order for you, but it's all up to you here, so get familiar with your brown and pink colors really quickly and pick up the tongs and scissors. There are small gas-powered grills no matter if the table seats 2 or 4, and my experience is that meats cook really quickly here. There's plenty of table space for plates even though the grill is prominently fixtured in the table's center, and they will change your grill cover often because "sticky" meat residues often coat the grill after a round of cooking.Time to talk about the food? I think so. The banchan (side dishes) were already at the table, and they included a rather sweet mashed potato salad, kimchi, spicy cucumber, spicy radish, and pickled cucumber. They all complement the meats well at some point, although the potato salad does seem out of place until you get really full. They also bring out a chopped lettuce salad with the first round of orders. The lettuce is fresh, but you can tell that they poured the sweet dressing onto the plated lettuce because a huge pool forms at the bottom.They have several appetizers, but the only must-order that I've had is the crispy squid legs, with their light crunchy batter and a good salty flavor. The KFC was a large portion of fried boneless chicken pieces with sweet and spicy sauce. I'd skip it in favor of proper meat texture here, which the sesame chicken does have. The seaweed salad and agedashi tofu are both pretty good. The popcorn shrimp and pork katsu are fun but not thematically consistent. The japchae is a good complement to any meat, but Gen's version seems a little harder and less silky than another delicious japchae that I recently ate across town.I got a bunch of grilled meats, listed as follows: #3 Gen chadol (beef brisket) is thinly sliced and comes in a relatively large portion. It's tasty and has the "beefiest" flavor.#5 Gen beef bulgogi also is largely portioned. It's nicely marinated and ends up tender after cooking, but it's a little messy to lay flat on the grill and flip. It's well worth it though.#7 Roast beef (premium beef chuck rib eye) comes in just 4-5 thin slices and cooks really, really quickly. Maybe 8 seconds at most on each side will suffice. The marbling really comes out in the great flavor and soft texture.#8 Premium beef tongue is around 5 rolled-up thin slices per order. Like the roast beef, it cooks really quickly. Another item with great flavor and tenderness, assuming no overcooking...#10 Gen yangyum galbisal, aka marinated premium steak, is about 5 squarish cuts per order. It's a boneless version of the popular short ribs. It was tender and well-flavored, and was a multiple reorder on my second visit.#15 Spicy pork bulgogi is also fine, and it's mild-medium at best. It's good but not special.#17 Smoked garlic pork belly and #19 Miso pork belly both come in two large, thick strips. Cut them up after cooking. The smoky flavor was a little unusual and perhaps should be left to the American BBQ context, but I enjoyed the miso version.#20 Shrimp and #21 Cajun Shrimp were both good, shell-on shrimp, 4 per order.The sweet dipping sauce and the salt and pepper mix are both useful for the non-marinated meats.Service issues seem to be a theme with new Gen openings, including the recent one in San Jose. Luckily, they were fairly minimal for me, with an average of 1.5 forgotten requests (all corrected after prompting). As I mentioned above, the restaurant wasn't full, so I didn't experience much slowness in order fulfillment.Overall, you'll find a delicious and worthwhile meal even at the regular price. I'll most likely be back soon for more meat gluttony.Tonight was my boyfriend and I's first time at Gen. We finally had a day off together for us to go on a date. To start off I went to the register to get a table, but when I went up the host and the two servers ignored me and proceeded with what they were doing. Fine, I understand it was busy, but they could have said "we will be with you in a moment", but they acknowledged me without saying a word. To keep this review somewhat short the waiter (he had a pony tail and glasses) forgot half of our order and we had to constantly remind him to bring our food. After we finished our first order we were ready to place another, but when we looked over the waiter was on his phone. We were left without food for a good 20 minutes, my boyfriend got so upset that he spoke with the assistant manager (Bryan); he did offer to only charge us for one person but when the check came he charged us for two. Apparently the sever was off, but he didn't let us know, and we had to order from the busser that was clueless on what the restaurant served. We also asked another server if they had a certain soup and he said "I don't know" and just walked away. Honestly if we didn't say anything I think we would have been left at our table without service and food. In the end my boyfriend had to ask for a refund since we basically didn't eat anything. I expected a lot from this restaurant since they are extremely popular in L.A.  Maybe I will give this place a chance again some day, but this restaurant is such a disappointment.This place blows - don't be fooled by the 4-5 star reviews given from the freebie promotion they ran during their grand opening phase.  Please ignore the people who proclaim this is the best AYCE or Korean BBQ they've ever had.  It's not even close to that -  I would say it's the worst in Vegas.  Pro's - cheap, 20 bucks, a lot of variety to choose from, and while you wait you can kill time in the mall and dl an app that shows you your place in line which is updated frequently Cons - oh boy.....Gimmicky and lacks any Korean culture/experience.  Waiters aren't knowledgable of food.  You can only order 4 orders of meet and they are TINY portions.   We must have placed a good 5-6 orders.  A plate of brisket will have 9-10 pieces.  Everything you pretty much have to ask for like sesame sauce, rice.  They don't offer rice paper or lettuce. The meats are average at most.  A few of the apps were frozen.  I could go on....Pretty much go anywhere else.  If you wanna save money then go to Hwaro which is the same price. Or pay 15 bucks more for dinner and get much better food at Lees.  Or pretty much go anywhere else but here.This place seriously sucks a55.Man don't believe the hype at all. Comparing this to their cali location they're worlds apart. Not saying that this is the worst kbbq in Vegas, but it's close to there. Do yourself a favor and don't waste any money here, there are much better kbbqs in Vegas.Ew moment of the week: Went to the toilet stall as a WORKER was coming out. Go in to find toilet seat down with pee drops all over it.... BRUHHH WTFFF?! YOU'RE SUPPOSE TO LIFT THE TOILET SEAT UP AND THEN PEE. As if that wasn't bad enough he didn't even flush!!!!! PLEASE MAN MERCY.I've been here three times with friends and family that wanted to try it out. And each time I've went here the same problem was always there.I find it off putting that their speech is always the same is "3 card max. split, 4 meat per order, leftover will be charged" I came here to eat ayce bbq and have a good time, not a speech of "here is what you can't do" in a semi threatening tone.Servers here are 0/5. They have a system where you don't have a dedicated server it's just a whole bunch of servers walking around. This creates the problem of zones specifically being left out. Many many times I saw tables next to me waiting forever to get an order in, when the other side of the room is swarming with severs dicking around. The servers seem to not have the intention of helping out too, they just walk around in circles and avoid areas waiting for their shift to be over. You really have to get their attention. Instead of them asking you if you need help with anything it's you that need to get their attention. It's very frustrating when you need a simple water refill or more potato salad.Echoing off many of the reviews here. You can only place 4 orders of meat....imagine coming in with a group more than 5... So limited!!!!! The portions are teri-freaking-bad too. So tiny!!!!!!!!!!Literally the only saving grace at the end was one server who kind of kept an eye out for us. Mizzo was his name! He made sure our orders we're coming through and apologized if it took a long time. This place has a lot to improve on before I make it a daily.Very good Korea BBQ at a very reasonable prices for both lunch and dinner. The only major drawback is the location, since it is located at the Galleria Mall (across the street from Sunset Station), which can be a rather long drive for anyone not working/living in this part of Las Vegas.Gen Korean Barbecue House has just opened 2 weeks ago. Still in their soft opening phase and running their promotion (free AYCE dinner for first 50 guests starting at 3pm). I actually have been here twice during this promotion (the second time I didn't know the promotion is still active and was guest number 39 of 50 on Sept 1, 2015). And my coworker that I was meeting also arrived and received the same promo voucher.There seems to be a lot servers/crew working on my first two visits. From what I have learned from casual interviews of the crew serving us, they have experienced managers and seasoned servers working here to train the new employees, so guest experiences can quickly improved to the level one can expect to received at their other established locations in California.  As is, the servers are all very friendly and tries to be as proactive about providing the best customer service as they can (almost never had to ask for beverage refills or grill change). I prefer to have regular cooking oil brushed on the new grill (only happened twice without prompting), or they would squeeze sesame oil (low smoke point so it would completely burn off before the grill gets hot enough to grill properly) afterwards. But when I requested regular cooking oil, they did fill a bottle from the kitchen to accommodate my request. I guess some of their other guests does not want the extra oil, so it is by request.Most guests that goes to this type of cook it yourself KBBQ knows and enjoy the interactive cooking experience. It is one of the best part of the meal in my opinion, but I am usual the designated grill master anyway. But if you can't cook or prefer the crew cook it for you, they will (but how well it turns out will vastly differ depending on their individual skills, as I doubt any of these kids have any formal culinary training). But seriously, it is not that hard to master once you learn to adjust the intensity of the flame while grilling your meats & seafood.They have most of your typical KBBQ meats, seafood and vegetables. But menu offering varies slightly by locations, if you have had previous dining experience at other Gen KBBQ locations. To minimize waste, you can order up to 4 meat dishes a la carte, which servers bring to you already portioned on plates. My favorite here is their No.10 Gen Yangyum Galbisal (Marinated Premium Steak), which I literally orders at least one each round. Their Chicken Bulgogi is excellent, but you really have to know how to grill these extra thick pieces of chicken without undercooking them or burning the outside or cooking it to its excessively dried unappetizing death. Cutting it to thinner slices on medium flame is recommended. The Beef Brisket & Beef Tongue is good and cooks super fast (unfortunately no half orders if you want less, like when you go by yourself). Their Pork Belly is basically thick slabs of bacon (options of plain, miso or red wine marinated). Shrimps are good and cooks relatively quickly, but your hands will get dirty peeling them afterwards (or bring your Bae that will peel it for you. The things people do for love).As far as appetizers, their salad is a must. Helps balance out the artery clogging yumminess of all the grilled meats. The Pork Cutlet is decent. The Fried Calamari is yum. Seaweed Salad is on par with sushi restaurants. KFC (Korean Fried Chicken) was disappointing, at least for me, since it really just reminds me of their variation on boneless Orange Chicken. Truffle Fries looks interesting (but it was not available on my first visit). Spicy Korean Rice Cake has a nice crispiness to it, but I recommend sauce on the side for this one.Even if AYCE is not worthwhile for you or you just don't feel like smashing your diet plans for half a week, they have Premium Box Lunch Specials ($7.95 to $9.95).As far as desserts. Currently they don't have anything, unless you count their Potato Salad (will already be at the table when the hostess seats you). But Macaron Ice Cream Sandwhich(es) will be available after their soft opening phase. Can't wait to try that.So if you are still with me after all those paragraphs, I  hope you find this review informative. Would I recommend it? Yes! Are there room for improvements? Of course, but they are already doing a bang up job so far and it should be even better in the months ahead. Price wise, it is very competitively priced. If they actually open a second Vegas location in a more centrally accessible venue, they will easily put major dents in their competitors gross sales and customer count.In closing, keep up the good job Gen KBBQ House & welcome to Las Vegas!*Use of iPad very helpful in checking orders.I really wanted to like this place since it's new and closer to my house, but I can't.  I went from happy face to sad face by the time I left. The interiors of this place is the best I've seen in a AYCE korean bbq place.  It's new, trendy, and clean.  The first half hour I have to say I was impressed.  The wait was short, and I received a text when my party was ready to be seated.  Party of 6, we were seated.  As soon as we got to the table, the side dishes were already there.  That was impressive.  Interiors and presentation was the highlight of the night, and it just went downhill from there.  There are rules to this place, which was somewhat understandable, but at the same time somewhat ridiculous.  They don't take Discover, for our party of 6 they can only separate 3 checks, and we can only order FOUR items at the time.  Let me repeat, for a party of 6, we could only order FOUR items at a time.  I can understand if there are only 2 people on the table, but with 6 people, 4 items are not going to cut it, and here's why:If the portions were bigger, 4 would be fine, but the portions are TINY.  Seriously, each item was probably shareable for 2 people.  Of all the AYCE korean bbq places I've been to, this place served the LEAST amount of meat for one item.  A plate of brisket is not going to satisfy 6 people.  We ordered 2 plates of the brisket, and that was fine.  Now if you were with a party of 2, you might leave satisfied with these silly rules, but I wouldn't recommend a big party if they're going to stick with four items for (let's say) 12 people.  It's going to run out quick, and you're just going to end up hollering at the servers for more more often.  What makes this place unique is there is no overhead hood system.  It's all under the table, so the fire in our grill kept burning out.  TWICE it happened.  TThey created what they thought was a solution by tilting the grill so the meat juices won't blow out the flame, but it just wasn't working when you're trying to cook your meat.  Twice the servers did this, and twice I had to take out the tong that kept the grill tilted so we could cook our food.  They really need to perfect this under the table hood system. I might give this place another chance if I come with just a friend or so, but I wouldn't recommend this place for parties.  I don't like how they don't take Discover...why not?Just not a fan of their rules, small portions, and their grill system.I came here with a group of six adults, two babies, and one toddler. We couldn't fit at one table so they split us up with two booths next to each other which is fine. The decor is very spacious, modern, sleek, and with the blue neon lighting throughout the restaurant, it has a trendy, loungey feel to it. They also had a big screen and they were showing college football. We came here right when they opened at 11 a.m. on a Sunday. Since this restaurant is new and popular, we didn't want to wait an hour. We turned out to be right because people started coming in and they got busy with people waiting.They charge the $19.99 dinner price for lunches on weekends. $14.99 for lunch on M-F. Dinner is $19.99 everyday. You can order four apps and meats at a time. The servings are small. Some people have complained about the portion size but I actually like it. That way, I can try more things and I tend to be a greedy KBBQ eater. I order too much sometimes. They were out of a few apps that day which I wanted to try. Out of the apps, I liked their sesame chicken the best. Their kimchi is really good too. I find that if I like the kimchi a restaurant serves, I usually end up liking the food as well.We ordered beef brisket, Cajun shrimp, galbisal, miso pork belly, beef tongue, chicken bulgogi, and beef short rib plate. We repeated some of the orders. I like the galbisal the best. I liked the seasoning on the Cajun shrimp but it was too much work peeling the shrimp. I rarely get chicken because it takes too long to cook and I'd rather eat red meat. We only ordered it because my friend's kid likes chicken. We received VIP service. Our waters were constantly refilled, our grills were changed 6-7 times, got more banchan, and the servers checked up on us often. The cons: no gyeran jjim (steamed egg), doenjang chigae (fermented soybean soup) and no dduk bo ssam (rice wrappers). Also, I'm not a fan of their grills. They don't have an overhead hood system. The grill burned too quickly and it needed to be constantly changed. However, you don't leave with that terrible KBBQ smell on you so I like that part.I haven't been to the CA location but looking at the pictures, their portions seem larger and they offer more items. I'll have to visit one of the CA locations to compare one of these days. Other than the lack of some KBBQ staples and the grill burning too quickly, it's a pretty good deal to satisfy your KBBQ fix. I felt so fat and satiated after. LOL.Having lunch with my girlfriend today. She said we should try out Gen. I hesitantly said Sure...Walking in, I already had a biased opinion formed due to my terrible experience at their TUSTIN location. I can't say I had a better experience this time around either. I understand this is a pretty new location but the kids all seemed young an inexperienced. They also need to step up their banchan portion game! This was also an issue at the Tustin location. I asked for extra kimchi. They bring the little thing with TWO pieces in it. TWO! I was like Oh gee. Can I have a BIG BOWL of kimchi please, perhaps with MORE than TWO pieces in it? Thaaaaanks! I mean, seriously. Wtf. Banchan + Korean BBQ go hand in hand! Especially kimchi! What the damn hell! Besides, the more I ask you for something, the more annoying it is for BOTH of us. I am an unhappy guest with no kimchi and you are an unhappy employee who had to keep going back and forth to bring me said kimchi! How bout just a niiiiice portion size to keep your guests satisfied??They have little banchan anyway, meaning not much variety, as well as TINY portions. They didn't have rice paper.They didn't automatically give you garlic and jalapeños. They do have appetizers you can order which is different and they also have some lunch box options which is nice too. That's about the only positive thing i can say. Oh and thank you RICHARD for changing our charred grill. Even tho we were pretty much done eating it was still nice of him! We only had the beef brisket, premium pork belly and spicy pork. It was all pretty MEH. The banchan was pretty mediocre as well. This is the third and LAST time I will ever waste my time, money, and calories at any GEN restaurant again!Yes, the first  Gen BBQ in Nevada. Arrived on a Wednesday evening. Located at the Galleria Mall, the entrance is on the exterior.I was solo and opted to sit at the bar which was completely empty since it was an early evening.  The entire staff here was really friendly and several of the employees transferred from So. Ca. to train new hires since they've only been open less then a month.  For those of you who aren't familiar with Gen they are a AYCE KBBQ.  Weekday lunch is $14.99 weekdays and evenings  and weekends are $19.99  The price includes salad and limited banchan but they offer additional appetizers for an extra cost each.I ordered the signiture steak, baby octopus, cajun shrimp, marinated beef, beef tongue, beef brisket and miso soup. Being solo, the portions were large and filling to the point that I was plenty  full although I wanted to check out the dessert menu. Unfortunately  they didn't offer desserts yet - because they're so new.After speaking  to the friendly manager from so Cal - he advised me there's several more Gen Bbq's coming to the Las Vegas area which will be convenient.I have not been this disappointed over a restaurant in a long time & it really sucks because I had my eye on Gen since they opened. I wanted to give them a month or so though. I understand the pressure on new businesses but today's visit was just totally insulting. Party of 9 for my cousins bday & they quoted an hour wait & they'll text once the table is ready. No problem, we totally understand it would be long. An hour later, we ask if it'll be any longer. "5 more minutes, just cleaning the table." This happened for another 45 mins. "10 more minutes, just cleaning the table." Nothing yet. Finally, we were informed that there are two booths available back to back, is that okay, they ask. Yes, but.. you're telling me that for 45 minutes, you weren't really cleaning the damn table?! You were just bluffing?! Oh hell no. We got to the table and there's a booth side by side. We asked if we could have that instead so we could interact with each other. She had to ask management if that's okay. It's common sense so it better be! Sigh..We were finally seated & got our orders in. Received our food and cooked them. Asked for the rice and they said it will be coming in 20 mins bc they ran out. Are you serious?! By the time the rice came, we already ate the food cause we were starving. We ordered some more and waited another 30 mins for those to eat with our already cold rice. Oh, and our waters only came 30 mins into our meal after asking them several times. That should've been the first things you give to customers. Patience was running thin at this point because every single server we encountered had the nastiest attitudes. No smiles, no eye contact, slamming plates on the table..(except for one guy who tried to compensate for his co-workers' actions but it was too late). Really felt they did not want to be there at all and we were nuisances for ordering. It's AYCE isn't it?! You make us wait so long so.. hell yeah, we're hungry hippos now! You can only split the check 3 times so we did. 3 different servers came by and kept asking how and it got old repeating what we were saying. We waited at our table for 30 more mins for our checks. We finally walked up to the counter and asked where our checks were. They said "Ummmmm.. Well...." Okay, got it.. This is how you want to end an already crappy dining experience. Good job. Walked out of there & heard 5 other parties complaining about their experience. So there, you've been warned. I usually give a 2nd chance for places but this place is not one of them. Cousin's bday ruined. Thanks Gen!There was a time I had given up on the KBBQ in Vegas. The quality was either terrible (Tofu Hut) or the price was just outrageous (Woonam Jung). But fear not, deer friends, Gen Korean Bbq house is on the prowl, looking to take advantage of the situation, hopefully, in order to execute the awesomeness of the situation, and finding that shining light, that wherever it takes us, we will find a way to succeed. I don't know what that last sentence was, I was on a roll. And sometimes, it's just hard for me to stop. Like the copper top. Who likes to drop. Bippity bop.Gen Korean comes by the way of California, a chain that has proven its popularity, particularly the Tustin location. This is also the only ayce kbbq in the Henderson area. I've heard the buzz and wanted to check out their stuff. I also heard it through the grapevine that they had something called 'rice paper'. I was like "Rice paper?!?". And then I left to try it out.For some of you who have trouble finding it, Gen is located on a new part of the Galleria Mall that had been built out. For some reason, I thought it was near like the Sauce restaurant and stuff. But it wasn't, it was connected to the mall. So look at the mall, and you should be able to see it. There is a sign. A big one. A very big one.Walking in, I liked the interior. It was modern, new, and fresh. But, it didn't feel too uptight or rigid. And you know I'm all about that. And then some. Picked out a boothy (boo), and started perusing the menu. One thing I noticed as I was about to order was that there were none of those huge air vents that are normally located above the grills on a kbbq table. Then I looked at the grill. Ermahgerd!They have the side vents that are located right next to the grills to suck up all that smoke! The only other place I saw this at was at Gyu-Kaku, and I thought that this was the greatest thing in the world. Right there Gen (Bennifer), you've got a big fan right ova' heah!Onto the food itself. There weren't a lot of misses, but of course there is on every menu, so I shall inform you. Popcorn skrimpy's. If you're expecting Taiwanese popcorn skrimps, you will be disappointed. These are more of the Chili's or Applebee varieties. Yeah, you know what I'm talking about. The other people I was with thought that all the other appetizers and sides were good though. And normally, my favorite thing to eat at a Kbbq is kalbi (marinated short ribs). I thought the ones here were OK. The meat quality is very good, but I felt as though the meat could have been marinated for a longer period of time. It tasted more like a steak. And steak is great. But kalbi... I need a bit more of that flava flav, catch my drift ;). And the skrimps (the ones you grill). I'll go on record by saying that I've never had good skrimps to grill on a kbbq in Vegas. That trend will most likely continue.Everything else was rock solid. The banchan is really good here. All the other meats that I've tried were excellente. Keep an eye on that #9, that beef short plate. T-ara was right about that one (I applaud you if you got that). One of the best meats I've had at a kbbq in a looong time. Surprisingly, their bulgogi (thin marinated sirloin) is probably the best in Vegas. Haven't had a good one in a while, and this one was really good. Probably a close second to the short plate. All the meats here are amazing and the grill is heated perfectly to cook them all. The service was good here. I've read the reviews and it looked like it would have been inconsistent, but it seems that Gen is constantly working on it, and for myself, it was probably one of the better services that I had at any kbbq in town. My drinks were always filled, and so were the banchan. They were also taking our orders quickly after we had finished our meats, so I was impressed.Gen is my go-to Kbbq in Vegas. This place has everything I'm looking for when I go out to one, and so far, stands head above the rest in town. Oh and Gen's famous rice paper. B to the omb.Intrigue and good company brought me in to Gen last night. The atmosphere is comfortable and trendy, the food selection is plentiful, and the staff members are very pleasant. However, the service is subpar, the quality of the food is nothing special, and the sanitary condition and cleanliness is questionable in parts of the restaurant that give pause to parts unseen. The confusion and disorganization however became a primary focus instead of enjoying the dining experience. I was really looking forward to coming to this restaurant, but I don't live in Henderson. I needed a reason to travel this way - and my friend's invitation was the motivating force. I was excited as I love cultural food varieties and the concept of a cook-it yourself Korean BBQ peeked my interest. Upon walking in to GEN, we were told our wait would be 30-minutes as they were quite busy. So, we headed over to the bar for our wait but became confused where to sit. It is an eating bar so grills are located between seats. I would have had no problem sitting down regardless of the grill plates, but the restaurant policy is obviously to presets the standard sides along the grill plates (e.g., spicy cucumbers, Korean potatoes salad, kimchi, meat dipping sauce & salt). I think having people stand around preset food is a little unsanitary. So, my stomach was slightly turning before ever sitting down to eat. Upon being seated, our assigned table also had preset seasonal sides at the table. This is truly a strange concept - I mean we are not talking about sealed condiments or salt & peppershakers. We are talking about open ramekins of food on tables in a busy restaurant with numerous people eating around these tables were preset food is placed. Not even the silverware in this restaurant is open to the elements - why the food?We first ordered some Gen appetizers to give us time to look over the meat selection on the menu. The Crispy Squid Legs were tough to eat. The Gyoza was very good. The Pork Cutlet was good but arrived lukewarm. About 10-minutes after we received the three appetizers another server tried to bring us another set of appetizers not realizing we already received our order. But, the atmosphere of confusion doesn't end here.Throughout the dinning experience we tried many selections of meat. We had the Gen Galbisal, Garlic Chicken, Gen Chadol, Pork Belly, Smoked Pork Belly, Gen Beef Bulgogi, Beef Tongue, Spicy Octopus, and Cajun Shrimp. There was really nothing that stood out as an amazing choice. Some of the meat had great flavor but most was bland that had to be dipped in the salt sauce provided. The garlic chicken came with a cheese like dip in a tin ramekin that had to be tossed on the grill plate so it could be made dippable. Food runners would drop off ordered meat selections and run as abruptly as they arrived. At times, we were confused about what had been delivered - and searching for someone to answer this question after it was dropped off was futile. The answers tended to feel more like  guesses. Some answers were blantantly not correct with what appeared to be staff feeling compelled to give an answer - any answer. For example when asked what the side selections were, I was told my romaine salad was the seaweed salad :) I know what seaweed salad looks like - so really? When I asked what meat selection was dropped off - beef tongue or Gen Chadol, I was told it was Gen Chadol. It was a different quantity than was previously ordered and it didn't taste quit the same,  so I used the menu pictures for comparison. Yup, I ate my friends beef tongue thinking it was my Chadol.The service staff appeared to be going in two directions at the same time - rather consistently. It was standard to wait long periods of time to have the grill plate replaced (or lit). Meanwhile, inhaling the burning smoke from food particles that fused to the stainless steal plate and produced a flowing, burning stream of smoke not caught by the under grill filtration system was uncomfortable. It really ruined the mediocre experience! Cooking the meats on the grill was easier when oil was put on the grill plates because the plates are super hot and the meat instantly sticks. Some wait staff would bring oil when changing the plates and others would not. Often times by the time you realize THIS server didn't bring oil, and didn't ask if any was desired, he was off and running. If you were lucky enough to catch a waiter to ask for oil the wait was usually 5-10 minutes. Additionally, not one server could tell me what kind of oil they were using on the grill plates. Lastly, there is a garbage and plate collection station outside of the restroom area. It is an unsightly, gross scene.  I can't stand to see dirty dish stations. That is something that should be in the back of a restaurant. I am not sure the flow of this restaurant was considered before the opening.My Mango-Tini was really good! -  In the end, I won't be in a hurry to return.Went on Sunday 11-8-15 with my friend Jamie P.  I don't know what I can add that the 500+ people before me have not said, other than they seem to have worked out the service issues that they had in the beginning.  I've only been to Korean bbq one other time at Shilla BBQ here in Vegas, and it closed down.  It was really gross and dirty so with that being my only experience to compare it to, this place was very good to me.  I got the AYCE menu and a coke and my total was $28.47 with tax and tip.  I didn't realize that dinner prices apply all day on Saturday and Sunday.  ___________\\\\Things I liked://// -The waitress did not get judge-y when we ordered a ton of stuff. -The meat was super fresh. -The salad was really tasty. -Their rice was really good and sticky. -Server was very attentive and brought refills and asked if we wanted more meat. -Food came out really quickly.-Huge variety of meats.  -The decor is beautiful.  -The baby octopus are HUGE.  I was expecting the tiny ones like some chinese buffets have but these were like the size of my hand.  -Spicy rice cakes are wonderful.  I like them grilled. ___________\\\\Things I didn't like:////-There was a huge spiderweb in the corner.  Didn't this place just open? -The potato salad was gross.  Imagine cold mashed potatoes with pickles in it. Blech.  -We had to ask for rice.  -Banchan was sitting on all the tables prior to seating people.  I found that pretty gross.  What if flies landed on it, or worse, some kid comes by and sneezes on it??  Ewww.  -I asked for rice paper and was brought some chewed up sheets that wouldn't even stay together.  I think they were old or something. -No macaron ice cream sandwiches like the other GEN locations.  BOO!!!-They were out of french fries and mac & cheese.  (like the only 2 things for kids)Been here twice to eat, for the sole reason that it's close to home.Definitely not a fan because of the horrible service.Wait times are ridiculous and the staff seems to be all over the place.Nobody knows their roles or what to do in general.Food is eh.. You get what you pay for with the price. Quality is just not there for me and some of the meats have a weird, pungent smell to them -- noticeable in the porks. They also don't serve steamed egg, no big deal but what a turn off. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯I rather make the 30-40 minute drive all the way to Chinatown and be satisfied with a legit KBBQ restaurant, not a wanna-be.A little over a year ago I worked in this mall parking lot when it was a fenced off construction site, and a few months ago this place opened. I have been wanting to come here from Day 1 with all the "reviews" that became controversial debate in Yelp Talk. I was unsuccessful asking several Yelp Friends to lunch here as schedules never resulted. So on Saturday night 11/7th I took the drive to Galleria Mall with my closest best friend in hopes of a long awaited fantastic Korean BBQ experience.Parking was convenient directly out front, on the Sunset Road (south) side of the Galleria Mall, in the newly surfaced parking lot. Gen KBBQ has a modern looking, upscale exterior w/ beautiful entry.We walked in and were immediately greeted by a friendly hostess. She said it would be a 50 minute wait for a table for 2 or we could sit at the bar. We requested to sit at the bar enjoying drinks while awaiting our table. She led us over to the bar and introduced us to the friendly bartender. We became immediately confused as there was no place to sit without prepared appetizers resting on the bar. The hostess and the bartender shared 1 of those looks like 'we don't get people that have drinks at the bar, just dining patrons' but after a long minute of concluding a gameplan to accommodate us, by moving the foods from the bartop, we were seated at the bar. This was becoming an an odd experience. I left to the men's room and she ordered a drink. When I returned a few minutes later, the hostess came up to us and said our table was ready. I wish that kinda "50 minutes" would go that fast at DMV!We were seated in the corner at a nice table for 2 to experience our 1st KBBQ dining experience. The server explained all of the side dishes that were prepared and already waiting on our table. I don't know about you, but I did question how long the side dishes have been sitting at our dining table and previously at the bar. Answer: "Not that long!" Hmmm....We ordered 2 AYCE dinners @ $19.95 each and tried the Pork cutlet-average, Gyoza-good, Squid legs-average, Galbisal-average, Garlic chicken-average, Chadol-average, Pork belly-average, Beef bulgogi-good, Smoked pork belly-good, Beef tongue-average, Cajun shrimp fully encased w/ shell/head/eyes-frustrating to peel, Spicy octopus-very good! Overall, the food tasted flavorless most likely from sitting in marinades too long and/or perhaps not cooking long enough or cooking too long.Our server multiplied into 4 different servers within the 1 hour we dined + 2 others that would perform grill changes. A total of 6 different employees that still resulted in a lack of personability that made us guests feel like cattle being shuffled in/out for the next guest. Not what we expected from an upscale looking place, but w/ the low price..."Don't judge a book by its cover."2 of the 4 servers recommended grill oil, 2 of them said no oil. Not 1 of the 4 servers knew how long to cook each of our selected raw foods. My friend and I both enjoy gourmet cooking and know oil is easier to cook food. But regardless of oil or not...several grill changes were required, plenty of burning residue w/ smelly smoke that became annoying resulting in me having to get up and find somebody to change out the empty smoky grill, no overhead exhaust system, and a flame outage were the highlights of our dinner in this very trendy and modern Gen KBBQ @ Galleria Mall. I think the owners should instruct management to hold regular meetings w/ all employees discussing restaurant procedures, how to work effectively as a team, customer service issues, food sanitation & preparation to ensure a Grade A by SNHD, familiarity of the foods in general including recommended cooking times for safety and best taste, and invest in better grills w/ exhaust systems, and a bar to accommodate guests awaiting a table so they can comfortably enjoy a drink. With all the traffic this place gets due to the low AYCE price, it will be just a matter of time before ???. Hopefully this brand new restaurant serving raw foods get their act together quickly. She enjoyed her drink, Mango-Tini :-)See 10 photos below...YELP 300 CHALLENGE 2015: #271Whatever you do- DO NOT PUT YOUR JAP CHAE GLASS NOODLES AND VEGGIES ON THE GRILL! My friends and I couldn't tell if the noodles were raw, and since everything else was, we grilled them. Our waiter could not stop laughing at and teasing us! It was hilarious, stupid and embarrassing but a great time! Any how-this place was awesome. My friends and I felt it was too cool for the Galleria Mall; it really seemed like a District or Town Square-y joint. Very atmospheric, modernized intimate dining on the second floor of the mall. We also had a 20 minute wait so we left and wandered the mall until they texted me they were ready, which was super convenient.The whole experience from the moment we sat down to the time we finally left was awesome, super fun and just a great time. The meats were all delicious and it was really fun to cook and season your own food and sample the tables' creations.  I think my favorite thing was the squid bulgogi. It was hilarious watching the little white blob curl and quiver on the grill and it tasted absolutely delicious. The jap chae, glass noodles and veggies, was also really yummy, double cooked or not. I wanted to order another serving just to double grill as a joke but my friends are better at being decent adults and convinced me not to. The other fav was the soju; we got pomegranate lychee (you can mix flavors) and it was so delicious that two of us downed a pitcher in about 30 minutes. All in all, if you're thinking about stopping by or want to try something new and are in the mood for all you can eat, do not pass this place up! It is so amazing and worth every dime!Geez, 600+ reviews?!  Many of these reviews lack merit, but... True fact: A LOT of people do come here. It is very busy all the time. Even on this unassuming Tuesday evening.  Friends that I know are not Yelpers are repeat customers.Pro-tip: Be smart about the time you come or be prepared to wait. I have never waited more than 15-20 minutes the two times I've been here.  Arriving Tuesday at 6:40 PM. Seated at 7:00 PM. Dined 7:00-9:00.  I could see the hangry folks waiting from my table. The waiting area was packed from 7:00-9:00. Meaning diners like myself ate for 2 hours. No table turnover. Duh. So come early or come really late. You're welcome.#1 - Gen signature steak - Want to feel like a pro chef? Season that baby with the salt and pepper from the little dipping dish. Bam!#3 - Gen chadol - thinly sliced brisket. Get this. Like at least two times. It cooks very fast!#5 - Gen beef bulgogi - thinly sliced, marinated sweet and savory. We got this twice. It comes with onions, get those on the grill too!#8 - Beef tongue - Not bad!#10 - Gen yangyum galbisal - marinated premium steak. Pretty good!#15 - Spicy pork bulgogi - Great flavor! Not too spicy.(In general, not a chicken fan when it comes to KBBQ)Pork belly options: #17 - Smoked garlic pork belly - Least favorite. Garlic flavor was weak.#18 - Red wine pork belly - Yummy! You can really taste the red wine. #19 - Miso pork belly - Yummy! Very tasty!Seafood options? Too full to consider, but we did try the #22 garlic calamari and it was okay.Other food items:- Salad - Very good and fresh tasting- KFC (Korean Fried Chicken) - A bit sad. Not my favorite.- Tofu appetizer - Looks nothing like the photo on menu. Grossly heavy breading. Skip. - Gyoza - Not mind blowing in any way. We got three times though. The kiddos enjoyed the crunchy treat.- White rice - Needs a lot of improvement. For an Asian establishment, do not serve hard rice okay?- Jap chae - 2 orders were sufficient for 5 adults. Not bad, not the best.- Rice paper - not available. Boo!- Radish paper - pretty good actually.- Spicy tofu soup - It was okay. Did not taste "authentic." Did I enjoy my meal? Yes.Would I come again? Yes.This really is a generous 4, considering some flaws with customer service. I liked the food, so I'm not complaining.

I've visited this spot again and have experienced great customer service. They have bubbly and knowledgeable staff. The owner was in contact with me after my first review and she's been pretty outstanding. She truly cares to provide everyone with an exceptional experience and encouraged me to visit them again. That's really awesome. If you're on the go like I am, they have a drive-thru where you can get your healthy grub and hit the road with a fresh juice, wellness shot or latte in hand.  I read another review stating they had espresso and swung by here to get my morning caffeine fix. The drive-thru option is great and I really enjoyed my iced vanilla latte with cashew milk and espresso. Yes, they have cashew milk as an option and I love it!  I will always order almond, coconut or cashew if they have dairy alternatives. The latte was super refreshing.  It wasn't full of junk and it was lightly sweetened with agave. It's bit pricier than your typical Starbucks (rightly so).  You're going to pay a small premium for quality and I'm totally fine with that. I will pay more for the wholesome ingredients when I'm cutting out the junk.  I loved my latte and will be back to treat-myself again.  I will have to try a lunch here in the near future. Go ahead, treat-yo self to some healthy goodness. They easily accessible and may be found off the 215 and Buffalo in the Southwest.

Pretty cool new pub with a beautiful patio.  Decent choice of drinks and bloody caesars that are not bad at all, I went for the Big Willy that comes with a candied bacon. The bacon was so good that I had to order a second caesar. The food menu has some good things to offer. Poutine is just OK, although one of my friends was really happy with the french fries and the gravy was nice, the cheese curds really melted and I strongly believe they should be crunchy. My seasonal salad was beatiful, made with red, yellow and brown tomatoes, which were so tasty as they have been just picked from the garden. You gotta try the home made chips, the perfect snack for your bloody caesar!The pub inside is spacious, kind of industrial set up, but it feels comfy. We had a blast in the bathrooms, they all have black board walls and little bucket full of chalk pieces. The walls invite you to write something and we, the well grown kids, wrote for the first time in our life on the walls of a bathroom. Now I have to come back to take a picture of the bloody caesar, as I forgot to do it yesterday and may be make another statement on the walls.......

Restaurant name  Pizza Forte
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
Pizza Forte opened just over a week ago in a small spot in the Hard Rock Hotel.  Owned by Mimmo Ferraro, It's obvious that their forte is pizza--New York Style sold by the slice or one can order a custom 14" or 18" pizza.  They also sell hot dogs, meatballs, and cannoli, filled when ordered and not pre-filled like most places.Four of us had dinner at Ferraro's Italian across Paradise from the Hard Rock and after stuffing ourselves silly there, we decided to walk over to the HRH and try the new pizza place.Not being a large consumer of pizza, I do know good pizza when I have it.  I've had enough life experience in New York and Las Vegas to have tried a lot of different pizzas.I had a slice with sausage and pepperoni.  The toppings were just the right amount, the cheese was quite good, and the crust was browned just right.  I somewhat folded the large slice and scarfed it down in a short time.   Excellent!  While I usually don't get NY style pizza often, I know that they're doing a great product.The dining room is shaped like a small L.  Entering from the casino, you walk past some tables here and there and reach the counter with a large Order Here sign and you can see the pre-made pies under heat lamps.  Then pay at the cashier and you're all set to try some of  the best pizza in Las Vegas.If Pizza Forte was closer to where I lived, I'd be there more often.  At it is, the few times I'm at the Hard Rock, this is a very enticing option for quick, solid food.

We ordered the cheese curds, crispy shrimp, steak tacos, and the venison meatballs.All were great but the cheese curds and venison meatballs were my favorite.We also had the Mendota martini and the Pancho villa- both also very very good. If I had to pick a fave, it'd be the Pancho villa- very flavorful.Madison had a huge need for another rooftop bar/restaurant. Thankfully, the Graduate Hotel delivered.The Madison Blind is 5/5 for ambiance, food and service.From the roof you can see state street, the Capitol building and Lake Mendota. It's beautiful. But when winter inevitably comes, you'll be just as happy sitting inside with the modern decor and large windows.The menu is diverse and affordable. We really liked the cheese curds, profiterole ice cream sandwich, cheese plate and steak tacos. Very shareable. The cocktails also rock, I highly recommend the martini with gin and cucumber!Service was friendly and accommodating. The cherry on top of a great experience.We will be back for appetizers and drinks, dinner or maybe even a night out! I really hope this becomes a bar to throw into the rotation.

My husband is obsessed with Naf Naf, as he frequently works in Chicago. He was thrilled when one opened in Madison and we were excited to try it the first week they were open.  I have eaten Naf Naf a few other times, and the quality of the food at the new Madison location was the same tasty food I have grown to enjoy in Chicago. I always get the falafel pita with cucumber salad, onions, and garlic sauce. I was surprised to see another review complaining about the pita, because honestly, the pita is probably my favorite part of the meal. It is so soft and warm and tasty and...I kind of want one right now!! My husband's standard order is the chicken shawarma pita and an order of his beloved fries. The guys working behind the counter when I was there were super informative and friendly. I asked a few questions and they answered everything with smiles on their faces!I have two complaints about the Naf Naf on State Street. The first is trivial, but annoying enough I feel I need to mention it - the decor is seriously lacking. I totally get that Naf Naf is a chain and they all look the same, but they look boring.  State Street is a fun place with a fun vibe, and I kind of just felt like I was eating in a cafeteria. It was just so sterile and boring. I highly doubt there is anything that can be done about the decor, but man, if I were in charge, I would sure try.  The more significant complaint I have is one that has been mentioned in other reviews - the overall amount of food that you get for your money is a little disappointing.  Again, my husband has eaten at every Naf Naf in the Chicagoland area, (and I have eaten at their downtown location) and  every time the pitas come overflowing with so much goodness that they are almost difficult to eat. The Madison location gave me a pita that was only about 2/3 full with a ton of extra pita at the top. I love the pita, so I didn't mind eating it plain, however, it really felt like they were skimping out. I know we will be back to Naf Naf many times to appease my husband's cravings, and I hope that they increase their portions so that patrons feel like they are getting their money's worth!

"I'm so hungry!"So moaned Kip as we made our way home, him from a busy Saturday shift at the pub where he works, and me from meeting my mum in town. Aha, I remembered, we'd be passing that new street food police box that Blythe reviewed earlier today, let's stop by and try it.Cue, the best decision I made all weekend.Having had a busy day, what with the Tram Stop Market, the lovely chap who runs B&B had run out of slaw, so gave us a discount on our meals. Totally unnecessary, but very welcome nonetheless. As we were going to be walking and eating (no mean feat) we both opted for rolls - mine with beef, Kip's with crab.  The beef was slow-cooked short rib in a sherry gravy, umm, amazing! Tender and delicious, the roll (from Manna House) soaked up the juices wonderfully providing an entirely enjoyable experience with every bite. The crab comes in a home-made lemon mayonnaise, and Kip declared it better than the beef (I wouldn't agree, they were both excellent and I preferred the warm temperature of the beef to the cold crab).B&B had proved to be so good we stopped by again on Sunday - this time I had crab on 'tarragon salted chips' and Kip had crab with quinoa salad.  Again, he was certain his meal was better (it was very nice) but I'm a sucker for chips and these were perfect, yellow, crispy chips made in their little deep-fat fryer to order.Mr B&B told us he's got the lease for 12 months, so please do pop by and try! There's a couple of great sounding brunch options which I'm keen to try.  In fact I want to go back again today, but I suspect 3 days in a row might be a bit excessive. Oh, and of course now I've made myself really hungry. Mmmm crab and chips...

You can do a lot worse on your half-day off than checking out this place.I ended my day early today due to some sort of "Nevada Day" nonsense, so I decided to try the latest hot spot down the street because they close at 3pm daily (and open at 7am, but I'm no morning person). This place is CRAFTkitchen, a brand-new cafe and bakery in Henderson that has taken over the space vacated by Bread and Butter. Judging from the pre-review Yelper buzz, I thought that there might be something to it.Seating is available outside in a dedicated space that's walled off by pallets-turned-flower-pots, although the window of opportunity to enjoy it is already closing. I sat inside instead, enjoying the semi-industrial yet warm and welcoming decor, not to mention the awesome pillow for my back.Noting that more popular pastries such as chocolate eclairs and almond croissants had already vanished, I decided to start with the kouign amann fruit ($3.25), one of the pastries still available at the counter. I hadn't enjoyed a kouign amann since 346 Patisserie closed, so the opportunity was too tempting to pass up. Although I accepted the server to get the pastry heated up, it was only warm on the outside. The fruit filling was cool to the touch, which I had no issue with, and it was a fresh, welcome addition. The interior of the kouign amann was delicious and flaky as expected, but the outside wasn't as crispy as I would've liked, and it also suffered from having these hard chewy bits, likely from hardened syrup. I'd still order it again as-is, but it could use some tweaks.Several minutes after I'd finished the pastry, my server asked me to repeat my entree order, which I did. I asked whether it had been started yet, to which he apologetically replied no. Whether he's living up to his given name of "Rusty" or he's still getting up to speed, I would have been upset if I'd been in a hurry. As it was, I just settled on waiting for what I hoped would be some great food.Finally, the "Chicken & What?" ($11.75) arrived. Excuse the cliche, but it was well worth the wait. Perfect pillowy buttermilk waffles and almost-impossibly tender chicken were adorned with julienne pickled jalapeño and a pickled jalapeño maple syrup that brought just enough heat to the party. It's one of the few occasions where I've been thankful for my specific sensitivity to spicy food. Everything in the dish worked aside from the small portion (bordering on "shareable") and the imperfect exterior. There were some bits that had the right golden brown crunch, but a lot of the breading was moist and light, which is not a positive in this context.Although I am not head over heels just yet, I'm already looking forward to the next opportunity to try more of CRAFTkitchen's breakfast/lunch menus and pastries. They have a lot of potential and although they're pretty much on the opposite side of Henderson from my home, I can't help but agree that they're already living up to their motto of "local. inspired. eats."(UPDATE 12/10/15: Smashed avocado toast ($11.50) was true food porn with the runny yolk on the poached egg. With the sunflower seed pesto, extra seeds, and micro greens, great flavors overall. Short rib hash ($15.95) was also very enjoyable, with surprisingly sufficient salt levels and really strong potato work. Pecan sticky bun ($3.25), comped by owner due to long wait times, was thoroughly delightful. Kouign amann w/o fruit ($3) seemed a little more crispy than last time, with otherwise similar flavors and textures.But I still noticed the inconsistent breading on my friend's "Chicken & What?" in addition to some unexpected darker-than-golden-brown color on the waffles. Please execute this one better.)Open a week and already inundated with Yelp check-ins and photos! Dragged myself across town to check it out and was pleasantly surprised: the patio and pallet-planters full of fresh greenery and herbs are bright and inviting. The menu has a focus on freshness, with some healthy-sounding dishes and a lot of indulgent options, and also some pastries and sweets on display. The food-related quotes stenciled on the wall are a fun bit of whimsy, too.Opted for the avocado toast ($12), described as sliced ciabatta topped with a generous amount of mashed avocado (easily more than one whole avocado), topped with microgreens, sunflower seed pesto (nice texture!), and flaked sea salt- along with "poached eggs". I received a single egg, and it was overcooked. Like I said though, they just opened so I'll give them time to perfect that. But when I come back it better be perfect, because as-is I thought it was already pretty great.Service was interesting. There's a pastry case and a large posted menu, but if you're dining in  you receive a dedicated server for table service. Seems more like a "walk up and order, then seat yourself" kind of place. I would have brought the overdone-egg issue to my server's attention, but I was starving and even though I left it til last on my plate, I was not checked on until I was ready for my check. I'm rarely on this side of town, but the menu is fresh, fun, and fairly creative- there are kinks to work out in both product and service, but I look forward to visiting again and seeing improvements in a couple of months. Perhaps next time I"ll try a kouign amann, though I prefer mine sans the fruit it is currently displayed with here.Items Selected:Brewed to Order Coffee from Colorado River Coffee RoastersKouign Amann with Housemade Mixed Berry JamAlmond CroissantGluten Free Pumpkin MuffinPecan Sticky BunOatmeal BruleePear & Pomegranate & BurrataRed Velvet CakesChicken and What?Chorizo Shepherd's PiePulled Turkey BennyShort Rib HashCroque Monsieur PaniniOatmeal CookieChocolate Chip CookieGluten Free Chocolate BrownieApple TartRed Velvet CupcakeCarrot BarGreen Apple, Chocolate, Pumpkin MacaronOwned and operated by Jaret Blinn, a California native whose long history in Las Vegas has gone overlooked by many due to his time in corporate kitchens including work with Bradley Manchester at Red Rock, Henderson's new craftKITCHEN stands to raise the curtain on the skills of another Chef who gave up a steady paycheck in favor of something more personal, a breakfast and lunch space offering "Local. Inspired. Eats."Part passion project, but also a choice made to assure more flexibility for a man with a wife and kids, craftKITCHEN fills a strip mall spot reimagined from a previous restaurant and with clean lines plus a subtle natural vibe imparted by cooking quotes and plantlife the experience starts with warm welcomes at the door, a 7 o'clock arrival finding the youthful team still stocking shelves as light tunes from local radio chimed overhead.Immediately attuned to no less than two-dozen pastries, each crafted by Jaret starting at 2am with baking extending late into the day, it was admittedly having e-mailed to discuss the concept as well as the possibility of a 'small plates' sort of tasting that my arrival was expected, and although the Chef admitted some fatigue following a late night Grand Opening with friends and family neither he nor his staff could have been more accommodating, a total of eight demi-portions sampled with rarely a miss in quality or execution.Taking time to do things right, everything from produce to coffee sourced as locally as one can, those who love the later will be happy to know beans are sourced from Colorado River Roasters and with each cup brewed to order the fruit flavors are robust with a smooth finish, each sip good on its own though all thebetter when paired to breakfast pastries offered warmed-to-order, each of four sampled far less sweet than others in the area with the moist pumpkin muffin particularly impressive while the kouign amann was slightly softened as a result of housemade mixed berry filling.Allowed to select the menu, but taking input from the team as to which items were best, plates were rolled out mostly in pairs from the kitchen and starting light with well-timed progression round one consisted of a well-composed salad featuring creamy burrata set against pomegranate with an alternative plate as delicious as it was different, the toothsome oats perfectly cooked beneath a crackling caramelized top with an optional mix-in of dried fruit and nuts.Again showing the palate of a chef willing to present his sweeter side with nuance as opposed to a sledgehammer of sugar, it was in silver-dollar flapjacks tinged in cocoa that tastebuds were next entrusted and, although better than the majority, the omnipresent plate seemed a bit too 'safe' to be worth too much stomach space, particularly when compared to juicy fried chicken atop crisp waffles kicked up by pickled peppers, let alone a Shepherd's Pie replacing lamb with spicy chorizo that you won't find anywhere else in town.Not entirely sold on avocado toast, but willing to trust the chef that the ingredient was put to equally good use on the pulled turkey benedict, those looking for something 'different' would be well served to check out the brined breast atop an English muffin with a sidecar of lemony hollandaise while a taste even more savory can be sought in the short rib hash with pan seared spuds, peppers, and onions.Overestimating my hunger when presenting the meal's final savory, a whole ham and cheese sandwich with creamy Bechamel pressed between slices of housemade panini bread, the somewhat atypical croque was nonetheless every bit as good as the sum of its ingredients and taking half home along with a box of baked goods it was approximately six hours later when the tasting continued, the oatmeal cookie with fruits similar to that of the bruleed version a particular standout as was the fluffy gluten-free brownie, apple tart, and carrot bar that ratcheted up the experience with tangy cream cheese frosting anchoring candy 'leaves' and buttery toffee shards.*****One-upping eat. in ingredient quality and out-thinking MTO Cafe in terms of creativity and menu design it would be difficult to name anyone outside of publicUS offering such a bounty of great products seven days a week throughout breakfast and lunch, the 25-minute drive from Summerlin notwithstanding there is no doubt craftKITCHEN is well worth a look for locals and tourists with a car alike.The second time is even better. While living in Southern California I took for granted all the great things that were within walking distance; grocery stores, parks, watering holes, and amazing brunch spots. Craft Kitchen looks and feels like it was plucked right out a San Diego or Santa Monica Beach community; very clean, modern look, and I can walk there!I've come here twice now (brunch & lunch) and both meals were amazingly tasty and the service was on point. The first time here I ordered the Smashed Avocado Toast and enjoyed it on the "craftily made" outdoor patio. This light and filling lunch is comprised of Ciabatta, sunflower seed pesto, micro greens, and a poached egg. The perfect option for the eater looking to watch calories and is an avid avocado fan. Eggs, avocados, and crispy bread, what's not to love?  Visit number two: Short Rib Hash. My first thought is, this place is basically a coffee shop with a slightly refined menu, do they really have the balls to put out a Short Rib option? Yes, and they can back it up. The Short Rib melted in my mouth, it was tender, flavorful with just the right amount of salt, I was very impressed that Craft Kitchen could pull this dish off. The poached egg broke perfectly when cut into and the smashed finger length potatoes had a perfectly crispy skin with a soft buttery inside.I know Henderson is far from the walking communities of SoCal, but Craft Kitchen is a start to something worth traveling for.P.S. - Get the Pecan topped sticky bun. Trust me.Well, that is how breakfast is done. There isn't much that will get me to drive across town but after hearing all the rave reviews of CRAFTKitchen and seeing all the pictures of gorgeous food I had to give them a try for myself.They were packed on the Saturday morning after Thanksgiving and my mom and I patiently waited for a seat while ogling the delicious looking pastries in the display case.Finally seated it took me a minute to decide what I wanted to order. Everything sounded amazing and as I unabashedly stared at the food from neighboring tables the decision process became that much harder. I finally settled on the short rib hash, while my mom ordered the smoked salmon on a pretzel roll. I also ordered a pecan roll to share. The pastry came out first and it was perfection. I recommend having it heated to maximize the ooey gooey factor. We devoured this in about eight seconds flat. Next, our entrees arrived and they we're everything my heart was hoping for and more. The short rib hash was evenly flavored and the crispiness of the potatoes complemented the subtly sweet flavors of the meat. I loved every bite of this dish. The smoked salmon was excellent as well. The pretzel bread was soft and pillowy and enhanced the flavors of the salmon and cream cheese well. I can't rave about this place enough and I look forward to returning soon and often.

This place is legitimate for back East neighborhood dinning.  Maybe the help is a little too nice to call it authentic (eg they are very friendly).  I ordered at the counter and they recommend the onion rings.  Wow, the rings were great.  Obviously made fresh on site.The wings were high quality with the standard sauce choices, if you like wings you will be happy.  I also did a half Phily cheesesteak.  It was a big portion and tasted great.  The bread was fresh, soft in the middle and crunchy outside, the meat had enough juice to soak into the bread and the whole thing was buried in melted cheese.  Perfect casual dining for the Everyman.

Restaurant name  Artisanal Foods Cafe

Review Text :
My love affair with Artisanal Foods just got deeper - because now there is a cafe. Like the grocery store portion, the cafe offers a heavily curated food menu, focusing on foods they carry in the store. For example, one of the things we tried today was an elegant grilled-cheese on brioche, which was accented with one of the honeys they carry. (Honey and grilled cheese are delicious, I learned.) The pots de creme for dessert featured the Askinosie Chocolate they sell. The lionfish was the most-stunning dish we tried, although a little unfair to compare to delicious Mary's pasture-raised organic chicken. Apparently they sell fresh lionfish, or will soon. It was so hard to choose from menu we had six different dishes plus dessert - for lunch for two. (Portions are small, however.)The cafe is helmed by Brett Ottolenghi, along with chef Johnny Church, both of whom stopped by our table to greet us and ask what we thought. I like that. They also are running a catering business - the cafe is the "downtime" from catering. This is not the place to bring your aunt who thinks dinner at Chili's is a real treat. This is the place to bring your friend who imports her own caviar.Incredible. Artisan Foods has outdone themselves! I dig the concept: selling specialty ingredients for home cooking, and showcasing store products at an on-site café! Menu is limited, but everything we tried was great. This is definitely a spot to make reservations, as seats are limited. Come hungry and bring a couple of friends- I wish I'd had an extra person or two with me to order the entire menu to share!JELLYFISH "CALAMARI" FRIES WITH SQUID INK AIOLI: The best calamari ever! Breading was light, seemed to be cornmeal based, and did not adhere so well, but this was the best-tasting calamari or jellyfish dish I've had. Bright, acidic, fresh, with that great squid ink aioli. Wanted to lick the plate. A must-order, great start to our meal.LIONFISH CEVICHE: It was a bit sad to order and consume this dish while staring directly at a lionfish in the tank beside us. But lionfish are the cockroaches of the ocean and they need to be eaten! (True story, Google it.) The ceviche itself was very citrusy and the flavor of the lionfish was not the star of the dish, it seemed to be overpowered by the other ingredients. But the tempura shiso leaves were the best vessel for eating this! BF said he wouldn't get this again, but I am open to other versions of lionfish.MADE TO ORDER CAESAR: The Worcestershire flavor is more pronounced in this version than in others I've tried. Portion is easily shareable, the egg was perfectly poached.MONTEAMORE GRILLED CHEESE ON BAGUETTE WITH LOCAL HONEY: This dish is where my BF finally "got it" about why I was so anxious to come here ASAP. This is the best grilled cheese. It's not a traditional version, but it's crisp and buttery, with a bright, salty cheese balanced well by the use of local honey and plated with house-made pickles. Portion is small like the price tag ($6), great for sharing as a starter.CRISPY BRICK CHICKEN THIGH: WOW. The chicken thigh itself is so tender, and served atop a wonderful savory mushroom bread pudding. I cook with chicken thigh a lot, and don't particularly care for the texture of bread pudding, so I almost didn't order this but it really was amazing. The chopped chives on top added just the right amount of verdant freshness.HANDCUT PAPPARDELLE PASTA: BF's entrée choice at our server's recommendation, reminiscent of a beef stroganoff, sans beef. The pasta was thin, delicate ribbons, married with a heap of roasted mushrooms and artichokes. Great dish.CROISSANT FRENCH TOAST: BF's dessert pick, lots of flavors and textures going on here. Bread wasn't too thick, caramel apple cider sauce wasn't too sweet, and the fresh julienned green apples on top were a great accent. HEXX CHOCOLATE POT DE CREME: Simple but very good. Three slices of orange over a pot of rich chocolate mousse, with fennel pollen. I can't honestly tell you what the pollen tastes like but everything came together well- and this coming from someone who usually shies away from dishes that combine chocolate and citrus. The new industrial location is near their former dwelling, but with increased floor space and a kitchen. Adding the café concept is wonderful, and Vegas needs more spots like this that highlight local talent (both cooking and sourcing!) in a way that locals can appreciate. This is making the shortlist of places we will be bringing visiting friends and relatives. Hopefully they will expand hours at some point as they settle in.It took me awhile but I finally got around to having lunch at the Café at Artisanal Foods.  All the recommendations I had gotten were spot on.  This place is good!  I was fortunate to be able to order a prix fixe lunch with Chef Johnny Church deciding on the items I'd get.  They were:Ibérico ham amuse-bouche with caviarCurry Kabocha squash soupPiedmontese beef and octopus carpaccioLion fish cevichePancakes with seared Sonoma foie grasHand cut pappardelle with BologneseCrispy brick chicken thighHexx chocolate pot de crèmeThis lunch was dinner also because there was a lot of food and I didn't let anything go unfinished.  I was impressed with ingredients and preparations I don't normally see.  Tremendous creativity.  One of the last things I would have ordered would be the pancakes.  Yet, it was an excellent dish with a mix of three kinds of grape made into a gastrique and served with foie gras topping the small stack of mini pancakes.  Fantastic flavors and since I don't use maple syrup, a delight having a sweet that was so different with pancakes.Chef Church asked me which pasta of two on the menu I wanted.  I looked at both and went with the Bolognese.  What he did was serve me the Bolognese with the hand cut pappardelle which was the other pasta.  The pork sausage, ground lamb, and chicken liver confit along with the tomato and mirepoix provided a great pasta.  The Bolognese was very rich.I need mention the soup.  The curry squash soup had a very good flavor of curry and was a delightful soup on this cold day.Finally, the crispy chicken thighs on mushroom bread pudding was outstanding.  Chicken thighs cooked and removed from the bone, then put back together with a layer of truffle and quickly fried crispy and served on the bead of mushroom bread pudding.  Outstanding!Finishing off with a light dessert of Hexx chocolate pot de crème topped with orange slices and topped with fennel pollen.  Chocolate and orange is always a great combination and this was a winner, too!I'll be returning and enjoying some of the other items on the menu.  This café, although small and seating maybe twenty people at one time, is one of those places that will draw me back.  A most memorable lunch!

Restaurant name  The Fire Side Public House
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
Great addition to East Liberty!I had never been to Station Street Hot Dogs so I was excited to check out its replacement. After a Saturday at the mall of shopping with my daughter we were famished. My fellow Yelp buddy Rochelle H. told me about The Fire Side Public House just opening the day before and that they were doing a "soft opening" and that all of the food was comped as long as you bought a drink (pop, beer etc.) so my daughter and I high tailed it over there to meet up with Rochelle and her daughter and check the place out! Upon entering we were greeted and asked to be seated right next to Rochelle and her daughter. Surprisingly the place wasn't packed at all. A few seconds later Dane C. our waiter came over and took our drink orders. The concept of the restaurant is all about the wood fire grill that sits in the middle of the restaurant that everything is cooked on. They also specialize in craft beer. The menu consists of Small Bits, Wings, Wood Grill Items, Salads and Skillet served items for now will more items to be added once the restaurant is running at full capacity. My daughter started off with the Beer Cheese & Bacon Fires (Fresh cut fries, Apple Wood Bacon and Smoked Cheddar Beer Cheese) off the Small plates menu and I went with the Smoked Chicken Nachos. (Apple Wood Smoked Chicken, tortilla chips, grilled corn, black beans, sour cream, salsa verde and avocado.) I also added a order of grilled Garlic Parmesan wings. A few minutes later our small plates came. Let me tell you that there is nothing small about the Smoked Chicken Nachos portions! It could easily feed two to three people! I only ate about half. My daughter loved her Beer Cheese Fries as well.For our main dishes my daughter choose the Fire Side Burger (Grass Fed Beef, Apple Wood Bacon, pickles, White Cheddar, lettuce, tomato and onions on a Brioche Bun). I choose the Chicken Skillet Pasta (Chicken Sausage, fire roasted tomatoes, Basil infused cream, Pappardelle and Fontina Cheese). It was absolutely delicious! I took a bite of my daughters burger and let me just say that I was one of the best burgers I have ever tasted! I finally got my wings after my main food already came. It was the place's second night being open so I will cut them some slack. After we were done with our meals we had to try the desserts. My daughter ordered the Campfire S 'Mores (Fire Roasted Marshmallows, milk chocolate, and Honey Grahams cereal). I picked the Blueberry Cobbler. The blueberry cobbler was simply spectacular! My daughter must of loved her S 'Mores as she finished it before I could even taste it! Dane C. took excellent care of was the entire evening and never let our glasses get more than a quarter empty before he brought us another Pepsi. My only complaint it that the wings need to come out a lot faster then there are now. I'm sure once the kinks get worked out that this will be rectified.I also had the pleasure of meeting the owner Robert Miller who also owns Sidelines Bar & Grille. He was very appreciative for my critiques,  ideas and feedback.I think the restaurants concept will be welcomed with open arms by the East Liberty community.

Review Text :
New ramen restaurant in Phoenix! I saw one of yelper's checkin a few days ago and couldn't wait to try here for myself.Grand opening was Monday 11/2, so still new here. Looking at menu, I thought they really researched Phoenix market by adding several spicy optionsI was in search of authentic Hakata ramen, so I stayed with basic Hakata ramen with my noodle al-dente, just like true Hakata style.Ramen came with kikurage (can't remember English name) but dark seaweed looking one on the picture I posted. Very authentic. Soft boiled egg was warm and flavorful. Unfortunately they put too much black paper on my soup and couldn't really enjoy the broth. I add black pepper only to Sapparo ramen. Hakata ramen goes well with sesame. I also ordered side of gyoza. Gyoza tasted very authentic, and I enjoyed them well.Service was not there yet. Considering they just opened, I thought it wasn't fair to say anything yet.Next time when I come back, I will ask them not to add any black pepper in my soup, and pay small extra to add more flavor to my soup. Let's see how that gets close to what I am used to eat every time I visit Fukuoka.Fact:  Justin Timberlake's hair in the 1990's was an unintentional advertisement for instant ramen.More like subliminal messages.  Amirite?Anyways, three of us came here for dinner on a lovely chilly Thursday night.  We were seated at the bar, front row seats to the magic noodle show [get your mind outta the gutter!] by an informative and cheerful waiter.  The three of us got a variety of items to share with each other.  We had ordered two Tako Wasabis, two Hirata Buns, an Agedashi Tofu, Tonkatsu Ramen with the rich soup upgrade, a Miso Ramen, and an Ultra Spicy Ramen.  Boy am I bloated.Let's talk appetizers:  I originally wanted to get my beloved Takoyaki but the Takowasabi caught my eye.  I never had it before so I was mildly surprised when we received two martini glasses full of raw octopus with fresh wasabi and pickled ginger.  Any time a place has fresh wasabi, I'm all for it but man was it pungent!  That first bite packed a punch.  Like the Takowasabi was Holly Holm and I was Ronda Rousey.  I loved the raw octopus but that sour pucker from the ginger and the burning sensation from the fresh wasabi was pretty intense.  I wish the server told us that one ordered would have been enough for the three of us because we didn't even finish the second glass.  Next we had the Hirata Buns [steamed pork belly buns].  I assumed they would serve it like this place we went to in Las Vegas this past Saturday which is $3 for one bun.  Since only two of us wanted it, had I known they were served in pairs, we would have gotten just one order.  Granted, they give you two buns for $3 but they're relatively small.  I could have done without this because it didn't seem like they steamed the buns at all.  They were cold and cracking and not warm and squishy.  It made the first bite unpleasant.  I also wish there was an option to get regular Kewpie mayo instead of the spicy mayo.  The spicy mayo was delicious for sure but there was too much going on.  Kewpie mayo is more delicate and I think it's perfect for pork belly.  As for the Agedashi Tofu, these were good but not as crispy as I would have liked it.Now I'm not going to get into all the different kinds of ramen we had in great detail but I will say that they were all pretty darn good.  We were informed that Tampopo has one of ten ramen pulling machines in the U.S.  They are the ONLY ones in Arizona with this contraption.  The noodles were cooked al-dente.  They held the delicious soup well and had great texture.  Any time a noodle can hold up the broth and flavor is a win in my book.  I also love how you can not only see the collagen floating in the broth but feel it sticking to your lips which is no easy feat as I had lipstick on.  The Rich Soup Upgrade (+$1) had a great amount of pepper I wasn't anticipating despite reading Yuko H.'s review but I didn't mind it that much.  I will admit that I wish the eggs were more runny.  I want to crack my egg in half and have the yolk turn my broth into more richness.  The cha shu was a bit on the tougher side as well.  I like my cha shu a little more fatty for the melt-in-your-mouth feel.All in all, I had a pretty great meal.  I would love to try their Takoyaki and Curry Ramen next time.  Hands down a great ramen experience in Arizona.  I wish you great success, Tampopo!When Yuko wants to try out a new ramen place, you go with her, because she knows.  Our first time here was fabulous.  I ordered everything she did (Tonkotsu ramen and gyoza), because I was in ramen training.In an unexpected turn of events, the ramen arrived before the appetizer, but that didnt stop me from wolfing down all 6 yaki gyoja once they hit the tabletop.  The ramen was a delight, with a delicious pork belly surrounded by things, a floaty egg and my first love: noodles.  The egg was cooked perfect, with a runny yolk.This day was extra special, because that's when I found out about kae dama... which is Korean for "Bring me extra noodles, please".  I dont know, maybe its Japanese.  Anyway, an extra order of noodles is only $1.50, but it takes a frickin long time, so if you think you want some, order some once they set the ramen on your table.During my return visit, the yolk was cooked too long, but the service was UNPARALLELED!!!  George, my waiter, was outstanding.  He essentially fawned over me, explaining the process, and showing me the fancy high tech noodle making machine from Korea.  This kid has a bright future in whatever he sets his mind to, because he has a winner's attitude!

Yummy yummy yummy I got GREAT sushi in my tummy!!! This place is fantastic!! I mean worth more than a 5 star!!! The staff is very friendly, the place itself is small but put together very well, very clean and has a relaxed atmosphere. Their menu is pretty large, all kinds of different rolls to chose from, sashimi, salads,  soups, kids platters..... something for everyone. They have a really good happy hour, different hot and cold saki, saki bombs, beer and wine. I was really glad I found this place on Yelp and decided to give it a shot! The sushi was so fresh and tasty, no problems at all, like heaven in my mouth! It was really nice to go to a place that has 5 star food and 5 star service! Now I know why almost every review is 5 stars, they are truly a 5 star place! Cant wait to go back when I get another sushi craving, think this is going to be my new sushi spot!!

After going to the movies my husband and I noticed on the marque a notice for 'the chocolate moose' we saw some very nice looking treats but could not figure out the location. A week later we are again walking out of the theater and saw the same marque, so this time we drove around the shopping center until we found it. It's tucked between the casino and the theater.Once inside I notice the 'menu' wall and a listing for sandwiches and salads. The cupcake listing the favorites and prices for large orders, what I didn't see is the food. I mean they were out of almost all cupcakes and their glass bakery case was nearly empty!For 1130am on Sunday, I thought I'd see lots of things, but was surprised to see it bare. They had a handful of strawberry cupcakes and a few lemon blueberry. But the other cases were empty. The big dessert case at the end had maybe five items but no items were labeled on display, I asked about one, I thnk he called it a greek yogurt cheesecake? I picked one of those and a lemon blueberry cupcake, both very good, flavors strong, cake moist and the chhesecake very dense. There were others in eating lunch, they had ordered salad and a sandwich, I notice they had a list of breads for the sandwich and they made each order fresh. I was disappointed in the lack of choices for cupcakes and such but impressed with my order, will definately be back to try again, hopeful it's just new business jitters!

Horrible. Serving shumai does not make a restaurant a dim sum place.  This is a terrible copy of Panda Express.  Tried the teriyaki chicken and walnut shrimp.  3 pieces of shrimp and 4 pieces of chicken and rice for 12 bucks.  If it was good then maybe. YuckWell I waited a month for this place to open.  Some how 4 wings and 2 pieces of dimsum with some noddles cost me 20$.  I explained to them I had ordered the side of noddles 3.99 the appetizer 298 pick two (chicken wing and spring roll)  and two peiece of dim sum 188 each.  10 bucks is what I come up to 12 with my drink.  but it was 18.99.It was bad.  It really isn't a dimsum place.  I had to throw away my meal after a couple of bites.  The staff was very nice and pleasant.I went to jack in the box and got two tacos and a plain hamburger because I was starving.  cost 2.14.  really bummed wanted it to be good so bad.I am not sure what to make of ChiAm.  They seem to have an identity crisis with the dim sum as part of it's brand name.   I was hoping for a good quality dim sum place opening up in North Las Vegas, but I was highly disappointed with the selections of dim sum.  The few varieties of shumai, which were okay and nothing to rave about.  The other dishes were really salty and blend. The food was also really expensive for what they offered compare to Panda Express and other Chinese restaurants.TL;DR: Sui mai does not a dim sum restaurant make.Lured in my the words "dim sum" on the exterior building, I knew I was in trouble when I walked in to the cafeteria-style setup. I looked at the menu, and the only thing in the dim sum category is sui mai (four types). The sides/apps section included a Pacific Shrimp Ball. Majority of offerings are premade, sitting-under-a-heat-lamp, exposed-to-the-air offerings you can find at any Chinese fast-food joint. They claim to use higher-quality, organic ingredients but if you're going to serve it this way, it doesn't matter. At 7PM there were no customers, so the freshness of the food was questionable. The items I sampled were average if not slightly below. Sui mai were huge, golf-ball-sized items, which helped to justify the ~$1.30 charge per piece. Shrimp items were fresh, juicy, and nicely shrimpy. Pork and chicken(?) sui mai did not stand out. I'm not fully convinced these aren't out of a freezer and just freshly prepared.

Finally I had the chance to check this place out. What a treasure in the heart of Chinatown. You would never spot this place from driving around. It really is from word of mouth, quite exclusive from the public eye. Once you find this place, it looks closed.. again, think exclusive. Don't be intimidated to open the door, you'll feel like you're at a house party without the stress of finding a spot to throw it at. I've been putting off of coming here for some time due to work and life events, but once I did stop by I've been coming back every week since! The owners are welcoming, kind, and extremely accommodating. THANK YOU for Everything. Hospitality at its best! One of the reasons why I love coming here. Great vibe, spacious venue, music... the music is heartfelt. Soul driven.. nobody needs to tell you to "get up and dance" you just pop up and do it. This place makes you feel at home. An undeniable comfort for music lovers. There are not many places where you can truly appreciate the culture that the owners of this Ultra Lounge brings.This Ultra Lounge emphasizes more strongly on the different Hip Hop genres versus the infamous club music of trance and house music, which all of Vegas nightclubs are all about. I'm more about the Hip Hop Hooray than the acid beats of what in the heck is this?! If you like some general knowledge of what Hip Hop is... this is from the Global Awareness through Hip Hop Culture Program: "Hip Hop is the constantly evolving spirit and consciousness of urban youth that keeps recreating itself in a never-ending cycle. It is joy, sorrow, pleasure, pain, victory, defeat, anger, happiness, confusion, clarity, humor, intensity, dream, nightmare, life, death, and everything else in between. It is the spirit that connects the past to the present and lays a path towards the future."There are live performances from some amazing, talented artists on particular nights. Sometimes on Wednesday or Thursday nights, they even have special limited food menu from creative chefs from the Food Network shows. My favorite is Friday nights, which is Riddim in the Red. A mixture of Reggae, Dancehall, and Jawaiian. The energy here is intoxicating. The drink specials is a wonderful reason to replenish frequently ;) If you're hungry, they do provide a delicious food menu to go with your quench of thirst. The staff, itself is a dedicated team. All smiles and ready for the night. Any spills, empty beer bottles, finished dishes, you name it.. they are on it like flies on.. on.. well you know!? Quite attentive to guests needs and they know how to keep this place lookin' fresh and so clean. Love our server Nick though. His enthusiasm and fun-loving attitude makes you just beam with good spirits :D He brought over some Tequila shots and I told my friend as soon as Nick turned around.. drink it for me hurry!!! Then Nick turned out and said... I saw that! O.o My stunned face was priceless.. I told my friend.. omg he has eyes on his butt or what?! How did he know?!! :P Love you, Nick.Ideal place for Birthday Celebrations and Holiday Get Togethers! Or just to unwind after a long week or night at work.Love the fact that you can't smoke inside. Deal breaker :P DJs always spinning the greatest hits. I once danced for three hours straight here. The music was too good to sit down. My thighs and ribs paid a hefty price for it and took a week to recover. Reggae can have that effect on you. The dance floor can be wherever you are standing. Although, there is an open space near the dj booth, if you like to dance with the crowd. Seating wise, there are 6.. 3 individual sized tables with 2 leather booths side by side for large parties, 2 long tables with bench seating on each side in the middle, and 2 small tables in the middle with a big enough leather seat that can fit around 4 people. You can also have a seat at the bar, which has 4 stools. The volume of the music is loud enough to enjoy listening to, but also you can have a decent conversation without having to yell in each other's ear! I thought that was brilliant in their way in making it a place to drink, dine, talk, and dance. A marvelous combination that speaks for itself. And for me, that speaks volumes in the value and admiration of what they offer here. I have a tremendous amount of love and respect for this place. It takes so much out of me to get out of the house, because my home is my serenity. BUT this Ultra Lounge is an exception. This feel good music venue is something you can't get enough of and is a one of a kind addition to our community. I love supporting local businesses and this one is definitely on the top of my favorite list!

Restaurant name  Chada Street
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
Located in the ridiculously busy Chinatown shopping center off Spring Mountain & Valley View, Chada Street is the second restaurant from the minds of Chada Thai & Wine. While I've never been to the original, I've heard great things, and definitely wasn't going to turn down an invite to check out this new spot for opening day. The space itself is pretty big. There's plenty of seating if you plan to dine-in only, but with the menu style and how they set the place up, it looks like they might be catering more to the hang out crowd. They not only have a pretty good size bar, but also a lounge type area with big couches and tables. It's just a really nice space with a neat setup, and I can see them being crazy busy when things start rolling.With only one page, it might look there isn't much to the menu...but looks can be deceiving. There's actually a decent amount of things to choose from, and a lot of variety as well. Soups, salads, meats, seafoods, desserts. It's all there. Everything is said to be inspired by Thai style street food and served small plate/tapas style, so it's perfect for sharing too. Pricing isn't bad either. Our table of 5 ordered a pretty good amount of food, and only spend about $80. Drinks not included of course. Out of everything we ordered, there really wasn't anything I didn't enjoy...but quite a few things stood out too. One of my favorite items was the Moo Tod Nam Pla (fried pork belly). It was the perfect combination of tender and crispy at the same time, but had great flavor and is served with an excellent Thai chile dip. I was also a huge fan of their two styles of Pad Thai. One is more traditional, while the other is made with stuffed crispy wontons. Both are big on flavor, with the wonton version bringing in an interesting concept with textures that I've never had in Pad Thai anywhere else. Other standouts were the Larb Moo Tod (larb meatballs), Sai Oua (house made spicy sausage) and Sa Tay (chicken skewer). Another dish I have to mention is the Tod Mun Pla (spicy fish cake), which was served with crispy basil leaves that were crazy addicting. I liked that everything had bold flavors, and nothing was overly spicy, at least for my tastebuds. The portions were quite a bit bigger than I expected too.The service was alright, considering it was their first day, but we did have to ask for some things more than once. And for whatever reason, we had to ask for an order of the Grilled Corn Butter a good 3 or 4 times, but it still came out very last and wasn't worth any sort of wait anyhow. Oddly, they were also out of a few items. We really wanted to try the chicken wings, but they had none. Then when we went to order 1 of their only 2 available desserts, they were out of mango. Considering they were only officially open for about 2 hours when we came, that was really surprising.At the end of our meal, the chef came out to introduce herself and ask us about our meal. It was a nice touch and overall, I really enjoyed Chada Street. I can definitely see myself coming back.I expected something very different being named Chada STREET. The ambience was on the fancy side and even had couches in the front for the drinkers. The lights are dimmed to set that romantic atmosphere like Chada Thai.When you put street food in my head.... I tend to think of street food prices. Here they don't offer that. I ordered: Pad Thai: I wish you could of seen my eyes when they gave it to me! It was so small. It was literally 1/3 of the portion from chada Thai. Tom yum $10: I had to ask for no coconut milk for this since they only had tom yum kai. It's the same as Chada Thai and I think their tom yum is always great. Perfectly sour and spicy(ask for hot if you like spicy) Spicy chicken wings$7: it comes with only 5 but they were surprisingly good! It's a dry rub and has a little sour kick to them. Crispy pork belly $6: wish it was a little more crispy! I also had to sprinkle some salt to give it some flavor. Crab fat fried rice $12: very good! It had a great seafood crab taste. It could of used a little bit more crab meat. The service was very attentive. Our waters were constantly refilled and we were always checked up on.I'll only come back for certain dishes that's worth the price.Seven of us gathered here to share several dishes.  We ordered:Crab fried riceCrab curry with vermicelli noodlesGrilled pork skewersNorthern Thai spicy pork sausageDuck curryPork and pineapple curryCrispy pork hockFried pork bellyChicken wingsCatfish curryLarb moo- ground porkTwo honey toast - one which vanilla and one with chocolate ice creamShaved iceBread with pandan custardChada Street's emphasis is on Thai street food served in a small plates manner.  My favorites of the dishes we tried were the pork sausage, crab fried rice, duck curry, catfish curry, and larb.  All were flavorful and I would order any of them again.  The crab curry was very good but would have been better served with rice than vermicelli noodles.  They varied a little in spice level but I'd say medium spiciness for most people.  The honey toast was OK with my favorite topping being the vanilla ice cream.The dishes I was not as impressed with were the pork belly--it needs to be crispier, the pork skewers were OK but nothing special, and I thought the pork hock was the biggest let down of the meal.  Except for the fatty outside section in one area, it just didn't do anything for me.Service was a mixed bag.  On ordering the many dishes, it was asked that the dishes be coursed out and not brought all at once.  We were finishing the first dishes when some more were brought and almost immediately three more were brought out.  We reused them and they were taken back to the kitchen.  At first we had to ask for clean share plates.  Later in the meal, they changed them without asking and they provided some clean silverware.Make sure you get the limenade.  It's a very tasty, refreshing citrus drink.  Too bad they ran out just before I ordered a second glass so I made do with water.Items Selected:Blue Pea LimenadeSai Oua - Northern Style Spicy Herb SausageMoo Ping - Garlic Pork SkewersKao Pad Mun Pu - Crab Fried RiceSen Mee Kang Pou - Crab Curry with Rice NoodlesKang Kua Supparos - Pork and Pineapple CurryDuck Panang - Crispy Roasted Duck with Panang CurryKa Moo Tod - Crispy Pork HockPeak Kai Saap - Spicy Tangy Chicken WingsPad Ped Pla Duk - Crispy Catfish with Chili Paste and Green BeanLarb Moo - Ground Pork, Chili, Onion, Lime Juice, Fish SauceMoo Tod Nam Pla - Fried Pork Belly with Nam Prik NoomO-Aew - Shaved Ice, Coconut Jelly, Palm Seed, Red Bean, Black JellyKanom-Pung Sung Kaya - Warm Bread with Pandan CustardHoney Toast - ChocolateHoney Toast - VanillaIn some ways taking a "casual" detour from the more traditional cuisine of Chada Thai and Wine on Jones, Bank Atcharawan's recently launched Chada Street sees the acclaimed chef take on an aggressive menu of items commonly consumed from the vendors of Thailand's street markets, the results oftentimes resoundingly successful though service still has a long way to go.Elegantly decorated in a stripmall on Spring Mountain, the bustling plaza unfortunately falling short of parking on Saturday at 7:30pm, Chada Street occupies a footprint nearly threefold the size of Bank's original restaurant and with a well-appointed bar beneath a photographic mural stretching the length of the dining room the seating options offered are multiple, the leather-clad lounge up front perfect for relaxation while a more proper meal is offered amongst low-lit tables or a private room extending back behind all-glass wine storage.Prominently featuring Rieslings, though certainly not lacking for well-priced spirits sourced from around the globe, it was with menus presented beneath lightly playing tunes from Chvrches that our party of seven made selections, a total of twelve plates complimented by three more at the chef's discretion proving an adequate amount of food for all persons present with some actually leaving quite stuffed. Noting up front that waitresses undoubtedly speak better English than I do Thai, suffice it to say that language barriers played a big part in service issues almost from the moment seats were taken and despite repeated requests to have items paced out it was not once but twice that items were returned to the kitchen, drink refills clearly not on the list of priorities despite the menu's bold spice profile while other oysters and pandan custard were forgotten until staff was reminded.Speaking next to the quality of the kitchen it should seem obvious that such a broad menu is bound to occasionally miss the mark, but setting aside pork belly that was surprisingly devoid of flavor and O-Aew that was more snow-cone than shaved ice the rest of the cuisine was well crafted and occasionally quite stunning without once drifting too spicy to be appealing.Doing our best to experience a wide swath of Chada Street's cuisine it was perhaps with good fortune that opening plates showed most strongly, and with blue tea that turned purple with the addition of citrus adequately refreshing palates between bites both the housemade  pork sausage and duo of crabs were each boldly flavored and nicely presented, a requested side of rice helping sop up the Sen Mee Kang Pou's sauce while skewers of grilled pork would have better ordered in double to allow for more sharing.Already seeing the 8-top's capacity likely to be challenged by sizable service plates and portions defying the low costs it was mere moments after round one that two more curries presented, the slightly overcooked pork shank also allowed to be delivered while four more plates were refused, then sent back once more to be reprepared just ten minutes later so that the crispy skinned fowl and pork in a pool of spicy pineapple broth could properly be savored.No doubt attuned to his recipes, Atcharawan's spicier plates saved until later in the meal, it was with a light tingle from the crab and duck sill lingering on the lips that the oft-raved larb was presented, and 'hot' to some even though requested medium both the flavor and texture were indeed excellent, the catfish in chili paste equally praiseworthy while the crisp chicken wings got a little lost in a flavor I presume was a numbing spice mixed with tamarind. Passing on durian based desserts and modestly amused by the mix-ins beneath the aforementioned 'shaved ice,' it was perhaps 'lucky' that a double order of warm bread beneath sweet custard reminiscing of Ghostbusters was brought forth singular since several in the group were already topped off, the duo of honey toasts forgivingly smaller than those at Hachi or Izakaya and undoubtedly benefited by more honey and creamier ice cream.****Still finding its footing, the front of house lagging behind the skills of those at the stoves, Chada Street is a welcome addition to a genre that has seen great growth since Lotus of Siam became a destination.A week after my visit to Chada Street, I'm still wavering between three and four stars. Looking back at all the food our group of seven was able to try, there were a couple of standouts but for the most part most of the dishes were just incredibly solid. We started our meal with the blue pea limenade which was refreshing and a fun novelty with the color-changing aspect of the drink. I highly recommend starting with this if you visit. My favorite dishes from the meal were the crab fried rice, northern style sausage, crab curry and the larb. The sausage was exceptional as it was incredibly spicy and flavorful. The crab curry had excellent flavor although it didn't come with many noodles to absorb all the sauce, so I'd recommend ordering extra or a side of rice to assist. I don't typically enjoy ground meat, but since we had all heard great things about Chada's larb, I admit I did really enjoy the flavors. We ordered a number of desserts as well and although they serve two different versions of one of my favorite desserts, my favorite was the warm bread cubes with pandan custard. We all noted it's resemblance to ectolasm, but it was tasty and unique. The rest of the dishes were all good, but didn't leave as memorable an impression on me. Service was friendly albeit a little forgetful. The pacing of the dishes was a little quicker than we would have preferred and actually had to ask the server to slow down the dishes to allow us time to eat the first rounds before the next arrived. The restaurant is very nice and I'm interested in trying more dishes on a future visit.Came in after a long work day for tapas-sized Thai dishes solo at the bar. The selection is good, and the quartet of dishes I ordered were all fairly solid, but I guess I expected better. Service was friendly and attentive, wide assortment of wine and beer available, classy and romantic atmosphere with low lighting.SAI OUA: House-made Northern Thai sausage. This is one of the more unique dishes on the menu, served with a variety of garnishes (lettuce, onion, peanut, ginger) that bring out the various herbal flavors within the sausage itself. Lots of heat in this, watch out.MOO PING: Garlic pork skewers, simple but well executed. Five skewers for $6, tender meat and fragrant with garlic. Enjoyable if safe dish.POR PIA YUAN: Fresh spring roll with vegetables and pork meat loaf? This seemed like another simple, straightforward dish, but the punch of herbal flavor beats any other version in town. This was paired with an odd dipping sauce similar to a hot-and-sour? The combination didn't really work for me, but I enjoyed the rolls themselves.HOR MOK PHUKET: Curry fish cake wrapped in banana leaf. Probably my favorite dish that I ordered, with just the right amount of heat and a comforting combination of curry and fish, formed into a patty and wrapped like a gift. I especially liked how fresh thai basil leaves were also included in the packet. I know the menu is intended to be skewed more toward the "street foods" of Thailand, but it seemed like there were far too many safe, predictable dishes on the menu. Perhaps a separate "street" menu would be more helpful? I find myself more likely to return to their sister restaurant, Chada Thai, than come back- but I do want to try the crab fried rice and crab larb dishes with a wine or two. I am heartbroken that they don't have khao soi though, that's the ultimate disappointment here.Overall, the dishes are great. Delicious; great flavors. I love the style of small plates because I really hate having to choose between a few favorites. It's a wonderful place to hang out with two or more friends (an optimal group is 3-4 to try several dishes at once with the right amount of food). There are a few dishes that are simply okay, but nothing to ruin the dining experience. Explore while you're here and don't just order Pad Thai.Kao Pad Mun Pu ($12): Crab fat fried rice. A simple fried rice with crab meat and eggs placed atop. The first time I had this dish, it had quite a bit of crab and although a usually subtle flavor, came through nicely. That was not my experience the second time and made it less enjoyable. It's a tasty dish, but I probably wouldn't order it again.Sai Oua ($8): Northern Thai spicy herb sausage. Delicious. It's just like the ones I had in Thailand. The flavors, especially the lemongrass, makes this one of my absolute favorite sausages. Keep in mind, it is quite spicy. I love the accompaniments of cabbage, red onion, ginger, and peanuts; everything is wonderful together.Duck Panang ($18): Crispy roasted duck with panang curry. The duck is juicy and the skin is unbelievably crispy. Wowzers. The panang is tasty, although a little sweet for my preference.Som Thum Thai ($7): Green papaya salad with dehydrated shrimp, peanuts, tomato, and green bean. Standard papaya salad; nothing special.Moo Tod Nam Pla ($6): Fried pork belly with Nam Prik Noom (Northern Thai style green chili dip). Phenomenal. The pork belly was delicious (as pork belly usually is) and the skin was crispy. The green chili dip was flavorful without being spicy and it was great with the pork. This is definitely one of my favorites.Tod Mun Pla ($7): Spicy fish cake with crispy Kaffir lime leaves. These cakes were oval rather than flat, so there was more texture to them rather than just being crispy and I liked that a lot. These are the best Thai-style fish cake I've had. Delicious!Larb Pla Dook ($8): Catfish, rice powder, chili, lime juice, fish sauce, mint, onion, and cilantro. I love larb. We got catfish to do something different and it's great, but I think I prefer pork.Pla Muk Yang ($15): Grilled jumbo squid with seafood sauce. Yum! The squid was so good and that seafood sauce is amazing. It's a green chili sauce with phenomenal flavor. I'm sure it works with a lot of other food.Pad Kee Mao w/ Shrimp ($10): Flat noodles, chili, garlic, and Thai basil. Also known as Drunken Noodles. Pad Kee Mao is one of my all-time favorite Thai dishes and this one was rather disappointing. It was decent, but no where near impressive. This is another dish I wouldn't order again.Kanom Pung Sung Kaya ($6): Warm bread with pandan custard. I really enjoyed this dessert. The bread is chewy and fluffy, so that was already lovely and the pandan custard is so darn tasty! I may need a whole plate to myself next time.Chada Street gets a solid 4/5!Love the ambiance. Very sophisticated and modern. Large mural like artwork behind the main bar and a visible wine cellar near the back of the restaurant. Dimly lit to set a warm and pleasant dining experience.The dishes are tasty and portions are decent. I went with 2 others and we ordered a variety to share:- Por Apia Yuan (Veggie Spring Rolls w/ Pork)Delightful and came with a serving of 6 small pieces. Also had mint and basil to give it a refreshing taste and was paired with a yummy peanut dipping sauce - Hor Mok Phucket (Steamed Fish Curry in Banana Leaf)Came out piping hot and a little fishy. For those who enjoy seafood but are not a fan of food that tastes "too fishy" this is not a dish for you. Very flavorful with the slightest spicy kick to it - Street Chicken Pad ThaiPretty average and a little dry. Definitely had better Pad Thai before. One of my least favorite dishes I tried - Kang Kai Nor Mai (Chicken Curry w/ Bamboo Shoot) Tasted like a Thai Red Curry... It was delicious! Does not come with white rice so if you want rice, make sure to order separate- Chicken Pad Kee MowDoused in whatever sauce Pad Kee Mow is stir fried in. Very flavorful though and had a lot of veggies in it- Moo Tod Nom Pla (Fried Pork Belly)The fried pork belly was to die for. We ordered another serving because we inhaled our first order. It came with a dip that reminded me of pico de gallo (a Thai infused pico?) but the batter on the pork belly was salted perfectly and the pork belly was SO juicy that I didn't even use any of the dip after my first initial try. Definitely a must try- Peak Kai Krob (Spicy Chicken Wings) Ginormous sized fried chicken wings. Came with 5 wings. Deliciously seasoned with a strong taste of lime and spice but the 2 flavors worked!- Honey ToastDelicious per usual. Topped with Vanilla and Chocolate ice cream, diced fruit, chocolate syrup and chopped nutsI started off with a beer but we ended up sharing a bottle of Riesling to enjoy with the majority of our dinner. It paired fabulously with the Asian flavors!Service was on the slower side (we went on a Tuesday night, I spotted 3 servers and the place was decently busy) but the servers were all nice. The food overall was pretty good! The portions are not as small as tapas are typically served but they're also not the largest portion if you wanted to order just one dish. The size is smaller than typical Thai restaurants if you order a noodle dish like Pad Thai or go for a curry... I want to say 2/3 the normal size.I enjoyed sharing plates here and will definitely be back. Especially for that fried pork belly!

Review Text :
This new kid in town is definitely a welcome addition to the southwest valley.  For only $7.99, you can custom build your own pizza.  There are three different crusts to choose from - traditional, wheat and gluten free. Quite a few sauces and cheeses to pick from including their house blend cheese and a kale pesto sauce that I would have to try next time.  They have all the traditional types of meats such as meatball, italian sausage, bacon crumble and some not so traditional meats such as sweet sriracha chicken and some vegan meats too.  What I really love in their veggie section is the grilled zucchini.  Once your custom pizza is made, it is flashed cooked in under 5 minutes thru a conveyor belt.  It doesn't have the crispiness of a wood fired pizza, but I like it a lot because the crust is chewy and not too crispy. Their toppings are fresh and quite tasty.  I ordered their traditional crust pizza with pesto sauce.  Then I loaded it with house blend cheese, Italian sausage, meatball, chicken breast, ham, black olives, artichokes, grilled zucchini, mushroom, roasted garlic and spinach.  They actually put the spinach on top after cooking so the spinach doesn't get all crispy and all dried up. It was very appealing to look at and quite delicious.  The crust wasn't all dried up.  But when I got the pizza home it wasn't very hot at all.  It was actually only lukewarm.  I don't know if that was because there were too much toppings and it should have been cooked a little longer or because of the thin crust it cooled off real fast.  Maybe next time I would have to eat it there instead of asking for take out.I would definitely go back and try some other combinations.  I was a little surprised that they were not busy around supper time.  But bonus for me, because I did not have to wait in any line.TPK is the new pizza place to be at. Despite the lack of originality and potential confusion with the name (California Pizza Kitchen, anyone?), this place is my favorite custom built pizza place in Vegas so far... RIP Custom Built Pizza :( Cons: I'm so short, sometimes its hard for the workers to hear me over the glass. If the worker is also short, we have a hard time hearing each other lolAside from that, it's all pros for me. Their workers always have upbeat or very eager to help attitudes, which goes a long way in my book. The quality of their toppings is much more consistent and flavorful than Pieology. I never have to ask "can you please put some more of (topping)?" because they give a generous amount of everything you ask for. I love ordering the traditional crust with both house blend cheese and ricotta, then I'll add pepperoni, regular sausage, spicy sriracha sausage, bacon, mushrooms, roasted garlic and capers. They really won me over with the capers. I'm sure most people get the capers for their make-your-own salads, but I love capers as an anchovies or olives salty-substitute. Seating is plentiful inside, so it would be a great place to take kids post-sports practices or games. I usually come here when I don't know what I want to eat for lunch, too lazy to make dinner or just need some comfort food.

Restaurant name  Bruno's Pizza

Review Text :
I hadn't heard of Bruno's Pizza until just a few weeks ago.  One of the folks at our martial arts school is from the same place Bruno's comes from and she thankfully made us aware.  Prior to Bruno's opening she brought some pizza in that they made while working out the finer points of the dough recipe for the climate here in Vegas.  It smelled great, they offered a couple of slices, and I found a new favorite.  It was just cheese pizza, and it was probably the best cheese pizza I can remember eating.  Ever.Excited that they finally had their soft opening on October 1st, we went in to try more of what they do, and we weren't disappointed.  We ordered the cheese pizza for my son and the meat lover's pizza for the two of us.  A side of garlic breadsticks and soft drinks complemented the pies and in no time we had our happy pizza faces on.The toppings were delicious and the crust was amazing even thought they'll tell you they're not quite content with it just yet.  Even more amazing:  no grease sitting on the pie or under the crust.  The meat pizza was delicious, the toppings were tender, and somehow they've found a way to get rid of all the grease and oil that seems to settle on pizzas like this.They're still getting their rhythm down, but Bruno's is a must visit place if you're on the southwest side of the valley.  Go enjoy a pizza, and help them hit their stride as they approach their grand opening and a full menu.Note: there used to be another pizza joint in the same location, so don't miss that it's a new place now.

My husband and I are huge fans of the food truck, Chrome Toaster. Thus, after finding out that Chef Aaron opened up a restuarant in Fort Mill (where the old Passion 8 used to be), we had to go check it out!!We came here this past Friday evening around 8:30pm or so. The place was busy but we were seated immediately. Inside there are a good amount of tables, a large bar with numerous bar stools, and a side room with a large table that can be rented out for family events or to just casually sit at (I have a large Italian family that HAVE to sit at the same table, so I can totally appreciate this room with a huge table in it!!!). There is also an outside patio with numerous tables and lighting. The place is decorated, for lack of a better word, very cute!My husband ordered the Duck Rabbit Stout (the local beer selection was excellent!!!) and I got the Habanero Strawberry Marg. The margarita was absolutely delish and a perfect mix of spicy and sweet!We ordered four different things on the menu to share....since it is a tapas style restuarant. They came out at different times but there was never a long wait in between, which was perfect!! We got the shrimp pupusa (anyone that knows me knows I LOVE pupusas!!), brussel sprouts, tamale special of the day, and the duck confit tacos special of the day. The shrimp pupusa was definitely the highlight....so many awesome flavors and the shrimp were nice sized! The sprouts were perfectly cooked and the chorizo was a great flavor touch! The tamales were nice and light (came with two). Lastly, the duck tacos (came with 3). Man, such a great end to the meal!!! Chef Aaron stopped at all the tables throughout the night just to check on everyone and make sure they enjoyed their food, which I thought was a nice touch! This is such a great local place that truly makes an emphasis to serve delicious food with quality ingredients. I am so excited that Tapas 51 will be added to list of incredible, locally owned restaurants with the Charlotte area!

Review Text :
Restaurants have come and go in this particular location in Townsquare way too many times. I really hope Killer Shrimp is here to stay!  Items tried:- Killer shrimp- Clam chowder- CalamariOur server was super nice and helpful. She recommended the killer shrimp, their signature dish, since it was our first time there. When the dish came out, it wasn't much to gawk over, but my tastebuds thought otherwise. The broth was so good! Loved the spice and the herbs. Dipping the bread in the broth was the best part. So addicting! Save time and avoid smelly fingers. Order your Killer Shrimp "shelled" for a peeled version. During happy hour the clam chowder is $5.  I can be a clam chowder snob, since I grew up in the bay area. There's nothing better than clam chowder in SF or Monterey at the pier. Not really comparable, but Killer Shrimp makes a really good version! I love the chunkiness of the chowder with all the clams, potatoes, and veggies. Save some bread to dip in your chowder too! The calamari ($6 HH) was easily forgettable. If in Townsquare, I prefer Brio or Fleming's calamari.It's literally been decades since I've been at the Killer Shrimp in Marina del Rey California. Located south of the Yard House and East of the Panda in restaurant is where you'll find this is establishment.They have a huge outdoor patio that wraps around the business since it's a corner unit. Inside you'll find a bar and dining room which is quite spacious. I started off with the spinach salad which contain the hard boiled eggs bacon and yummy. I followed with the fisherman's seafood entree which is a seafood stew that contained an assortment of seafood and was garnish with two pieces of toasted bread which was perfect for dipping into the sauce along with all the seafood. The portions are decent here and the prices are fair - everything was tasty and flavorful.If you like spicier flare go for the original killer shrimp wh i has a Cajun kick and  yummy too!

Yumm alert!You like all you can eat sushi? Can you stuff it in your pie hole (sushi hole) in an hour? You betcha!For about $26 bucks for dinner, one person, no sharing, finish in an hour ANYTHING on the menu'. Challenge accepted!My dining guest does not eat sushi.... sadly... however, he did have some amazing pot stickers as well as some tasty katsu chicken; so there is something on the menu for our non sushi eating friends.Here is a tip as well....... you can order half sizes of the rolls! If you are anything like me you want to try as much as your sushi tummy can handle! Also, beer drinking is fun, but it does have a tendency to make that rice expand in your belly, so stick to water or their amazing tea... Lunch is around $21 smackers, all you can eat, no sharing... you get the idea...Oh yes I will be back!This experience went 100-0 real quick.When we got there the place wasn't crazy busy. We got seated right away and the servers were genuinely super nice and on top of things!The rolls were decent, we tried the following:Rolls-TigerShrimp LoverFreaky FridayBaked SalmonSpiderHot and JuicyLisa Hand RollAppetizers-Cucumber Crab SaladSeaweed SaladScreaming OrgasmSweet and Spicy PotstickersTempura CalamariDessert-Strawberry Mochi duhLike I said the rolls were decent but I'm sad to say we will not be returning due to the horrendous wait time to receive rolls.There was a time we waited 28 minutes for a roll. I get they only had two sushi chefs but there were times when we saw rolls waiting for ten plus minutes to be picked up and taken to tables. It's unfair to blame the chefs when they're doing their job.YELP 300 CHALLENGE 2015: #300 GOAL ACHIEVED!Saturday Solo Sushi-Round #3This past Saturday 12/12th, I arrived here after 2 unsuccessful attempts to eat at other AYCE sushi restaurants, that I walked out of due to a combination of bad service, questionable sanitary practices and no fresh oysters and AYCE limits on salmon roe. So here I am @ Sushi Way on Paradise Rd., 2 blocks N. of Flamingo, for my 3rd attempt of the evening to feast on AYCE sushi. I'm pleased to write the quote "Three Times A Charm" as Sushi Way is a fantastic AYCE sushi restaurant.Modern interior w/ plenty of pretty Christmas decor, House Music & Top Hits playing as background music from Pandora, friendly service from start to finish by the host and all employees. This enjoyable 90 minute AYCE delicious sushi dinner was competitively priced @ $26.95. TIP FOR THE LADIES: They offer 1/2 rolls so you can try a variety and not fill up so quickly.I sat in a comfortable chair at the L shaped granite counter sushi bar and began w/ a cold raspberry iced tea, fresh oysters and at least a half a dozen salmon roe with a stuffed Santa Claus as my dining partner.The sushi chef was welcoming, filled w/ smiles and had plenty of enthusiasm. His talents offered several hand crafted culinary works of art in a timely manner. He clearly loves his job here at Sushi Way! He prepared several delicious rolls i've never tried and some of my favorites that also tasted excellent. The Halibut was cut thick w/ excellent rice consistency. Jalapeno slices adorned the Yellowtail belly sashimi. The Spider Roll was very good w/ warm shrimp tempura. The Alaskan and Hawaiian rolls were flavorful favorites. Baked green mussels topped w/ a hot cheese sauce. Poke tuna salad was excellent! Garlic yellowtail was spicy good. The Sexy Lazy Special was a delight consisting of coconut shrimp tempura & cream cheese, topped w/ salmon, avocado & coconut flakes, w/ a spicy mayo sauce. Yum!The Rock & Roll Special was also a delight consisting of tuna, salmon, yellowtail, white fish and crab wrapped in cucumber, topped w/ "orgasm sauce." LOLFor dessert, I turned down the several offerings for 2 sea creatures. The Octopus had a perfect crunch and seawater taste. Eel had a smooth texture w/ warm sweet sauce that ended my Saturday Solo Sushi.Yay! I'm a fan.See 14 photos below...YELP 300 CHALLENGE 2015: #300 GOAL ACHIEVED!With multiple sushi joints popping up in Vegas, how does one stay ahead of the pack? Well, there's a no brainer here! Quality and Service are on top of my list of what I look for.I didn't stumble onto Sushi Way. It was under "hot and new" so I gave it a shot! I always prefer to be seated at the bar, so I can interact with the chef. It's also very entertaining to watch them prepare my meal.And wow! I was very impressed by the temperature of the sushi and the fish to rice ratio was excellent.I was even more impressed that the chef kept making items that were off menu! I was game for anything! I love that this place doesn't use a lot of cream cheese in their sushi as fillers! If I want to eat cream cheese, I have lots in my fridge! LOLHaving an option for sushi half rolls is another reason I consider when dining in and I'm glad this place offers that! Some places only do half rolls on your last order. Then there's the awesome staff at Sushi Way. Where they treat you in an AWESOME way!

Review Text :
So finally 50 N Central Avenue has a new tenant, The Counter. Open daily.The Counter offers sandwiches, salads, shake shake shakes, booze, and build-your-own-grilled cheese for $8, but the champions are the burgers.  Offering an incentive to have your burger and eat it too, they sell on average for $12-13, but if you build-your-own and indulge in extra fixin's, you'll be lighter $12-13 MINIMUM.All the favorites from fast food/sandwich shoppes are combined onto one menu. From regular ingredients to premium choices, from natural to organic. Currently the offerings are 3 patty sizes; beef patties, tuna, turkey, or chicken; 20 flavors of cheese slices or spreads; over 25 types of relish, mustard, salsa, aioli, vinaigrette, or other dressings (option to purchase a flight of 3); 40 different toppings of veggies, pickled stuffs, chili, meats; 8 types of buns; and $3 sides consisting of various fries, salads, veggies, and chili. Word to the wise, if you're an office folk who's only allotted a set number of minutes to eat at midday, download the 15 page menu from the website and give it a look-see in advance because after you've made your choices and go through the required 6-Step BYOB process you'll already need to head back to the office.1. Choose Your Burger2. Choose Your Cheese3. Choose Your Sauce4. Choose Your Toppings5. Choose Your Bun6. Choose Your SideStill want to eat here?I do! Their sign clearly reads "The Counter Custom Built Burgers" and one day I want to be the idiot who goes ALL veggie on 'em. Veg Up, b!tches. Unfortunately, it hasn't happen yet because on the afternoon that I went there was no take-out. Huhhh? I was told they were only fulfilling eat-in orders because things got too confusing and they couldn't handle both.Okay, now I'm confused. They've opened a restaurant downtown, directly adjacent to the Jefferson / 1st Ave metro stop, it was lunch time, and they were not fulfilling take-out orders.Wow. Wow.Uh, wow.Okay, I'll try back later.Hope y'all are still in business...I can't believe all of the negative reviews on this place. THEY'VE BEEN OPEN A WEEK, PEOPLE! CHILL!  Yes, there is a bit of a wait. Give these guys some time and I'm sure they'll run a tighter ship before long. I have been here twice and have been happy both times. The people that work here are all very friend and nice. I take onboard that it's pricey, but for $16 I got a 1/3 patty cooked medium rare, the way I like it, with cheddar, bleu cheese, bacon, spinach, grilled onions and sautéed mushrooms with a side of onion strings. The patty was SOLID: fresh and cooked to perfection; all of the extras were of high quality and the onion strings were DELICIOUS. I thought that they give you plenty of food. Yes, you pay more, but we're talking high quality ingredients, not pre-cooked McDonald's. I can't afford to do this every day but I deserve something like this once or twice a month. I'm really eager to try their milkshakes....and then there's the bar. Again, don't let the negative reviews deter you, this is right up my alley. If you're short on time, give them a few weeks to settle in or go later in the day, not during the lunch rush.The Counter is so conveniently located, it's hard not to pass by without thinking of stopping in for a bite to eat. That's why I've been back twice since my first visit (when I couldn't get take out - but we won't speak of that again).For my second visit, I dined-in and sat at the bar. Thought I chose a good spot, but folks still bumped me as they passed behind. Next time - table only. The couple next to me was sharing a burger and side. Not sure if it filled their bellies, but they seemed to enjoy every bite. On my other side someone ordered a grilled cheese without side. Looked a bit skimpy, so I can't imagine how filling that could have been.Every dish coming out of the kitchen looked yummy. The burgers were stacked and even though I'm not much of a flesh eater, I was thinking "dayum, me want burger."Anyway, reality. Like I said in my first review: I would be the idiot who went all veggie on 'em. So my build-your-own-burger sans burger turned out to be a bowl of salad. With a side order of yam fries without question.I was impressed with the salad - very fresh, very crisp, very green, very good. And the yam fries were tasty. Salted, not sweeted like other restaurants are serving them. The contrast of sweet to salty flavor was excellent and the fries accompanied my salad con mucho harmony. Tongue was happy, tummy be happy, me happy.For my third visit I had a jones for yam fries! or sweet pos as some folk calls 'em. I ordered take out. Decided on the build-your-own-grilled cheese. Requested all kinds of fixin's. In my head, i pictured the guys in the kitchen stuffing topping after topping between slices of bread and wrapping up a fat sammich for me - just like the fat burgers they serve. Nope, wrong answer. My grilled cheese was still on the skimpy side, though not as skimped as the grilled cheese the woman had during my second visit. When I got to my destination, I added two more toppings of my own. Don't get me wrong, it was a good sandwich, but nothing ticks me off more than having to re-dress something that was build-your-own in the first place. Tsk, tsk. Sweet pos were a total failure. I ate them straight from the box, but they tasted like the kitchen had either re-warmed them or twice fried (overcooked) them.Smh. What does disappointment mean?noun- the feeling of sadness or displeasure caused by the non-fulfillment of one's hopes or expectations.My jones was gone's.

New Asian fusion spot now open on the East side, complete with a pun-ny name! They have Thai and Chinese staple dishes for the traditionalists, and some fun specials, too. You can get any number of Thai/Chinese dishes here, and they're fairly solid- the pan fried potstickers (great dipping sauce!) and crab Rangoon (really light on the cream cheese) are made fresh daily, but my usual picks are the egg foo yung or the crispy pork with Chinese broccoli. My guy often opts for the orange chicken, chow mein, or the wor won ton soup (giant portion).  If you're feeling more adventurous, they offer some fusion specials. I've enjoyed the Thai-rrito, the Thai deviled eggs, and the Mongolian beef hash and eggs. Snag the garlic cheese fries during HH. BEVERAGES: Thai tea, thai coffee, Torani fruit smoothies, blended frappes, milk tea, flavored teas, and great honey boba. Try the Turbo Frappe for an unbeatable caffeine rush.Family owned and operated with attentive and friendly service. Everything is made to order, so call ahead or using Eat24.  Small stage area in the back for performances and special events. HH specials available 11AM-3PM, and they give teachers, EMT, police, firefighters, etc 10% off with ID, all day, every day.December 2015 Edit: they've pared down the menu and are trying out a Sushi Tuesdays special.

Review Text :
Don't get the "Pasta BRAVO!" entree.Now that we've gotten that out of the way, I think I can say that I've had enough good dishes to recommend this place. Located next to Dillard's and Larsen's Grill and facing Sunset Road, BRAVO! Cucina Italiana provides a sit-down option that's more upscale than other Galleria mall dining options such as Chevy's and Red Robin.I had the complimentary rosemary focaccia on both occasions. It's soft and herbaceous, and it soaks up all the liquid you might want. Their house olive oil and vinegar is quite tasty, but I wasn't as impressed with the herbed red dipping sauce that they provided on my second visit.I had Mama's Lasagna Bolognese ($17.99) during that first visit. It isn't exactly a traditional Italian lasagna. It's presented in an oval ceramic bowl, and it has an alfredo sauce and a Bolognese sauce, but it does have that gooey mozzarella on top, ricotta inside, and tasty ground beef spiced in an "Italian" way. There was a bit of a vegetable inside that give a crunch, and I enjoyed this as well. Oh, and the server hand-grates Parmesan cheese to top your lasagna to your liking. I had it 50% off on National Lasagna Day, and while I'm not sure how I feel about the full price value, I was quite happy with the deal.The second time around, I focused on their happy hour menu. They call it "Bar Bites" and provide it in the bar / high top seating section 3:30-6:30pm on weekdays, and all day on weekends. I shared some appetizers with my friend because they're such a good deal.The first app was Arancini ($3.95 Bar Bites price), which they describe as fried cheesy risotto. Maybe risotto is a bit off, and although they do invite comparisons to tater tots, they're very crunchy outside and creamy inside. They went well with either of the two dipping sauces, one a mildly spicy cream ("diavolo"), and the other a simple tomato sauce ("pomodoro").The Crispy Mozzarella Ravioli ($4.95 BB) was perhaps more delicious. It has a similar blend of textures as the first app, but richer flavor from the mozzarella. It comes with a horseradish aioli and a marinara sauce. Again, everything was good.The Spicy Bacon & Boursin Flatbread ($4.95 BB) sounded a lot better than it tasted. It should have been a home run with candied bacon, chared tomato sauce, caramelized onions, mozzarella, parmesan spicy aioli, and green onions. It wasn't bad, but none of the components stood out.Finally, we split that underwhelming Pasta BRAVO! ($15.99). Underseasoned if al dente rigatoni, underseasoned dry chicken, uninspiring mushrooms, and a decent roasted red pepper sauce needed all the help it could get flavor-wise, and I did have it in the form of leftover sauces from the apps. I just didn't think to use it until the last few bites, and it shouldn't be necessary. I'm disappointed that a dish that bears the restaurant name and is described as their "signature dish" was so underwhelming, but at least a $10-off-an-entree birthday credit via their myBRAVO rewards program took the sting out of the wallet.I didn't have any service issues, especially not on today's visit. They took orders and delivered food promptly (all apps simultaneously, entree son enough afterward). Also, they processed discounts just fine. I was glad to see that the BOGO Bar Bites appetizer w/ Yelp check-in worked in addition to the $10 credit.I avoided downgrading my rating to three stars because I would definitely come back to BRAVO! for cheap happy hour appetizers and the lasagna. Legit sit-down restaurants are few and far between in this area of Henderson near Sunset Station, but it looks like this sister restaurant of Brio Tuscan Grille has managed to fill a neighborhood niche, give or take one particular pasta dish.(UPDATE 12/23/15: Visit #3. Had $10 credit again for some reason, so I went back to Bar Bites. My favorite tonight was the Bravo! Fries at $3.95, with well-seasoned fries, delicious crumbled bacon, gorgonzola, creamy horseradish aioli, and green onions cut on the bias. The Bravo! Burger at $5.95 is quite serviceable overall with American cheese, the same aioli as the above fries, and unadorned fries w/ a side of ketchup. I thought the bun was rather bready though, and the patty wasn't perfectly medium-rare throughout. The Crispy Shrimp Napoli, $5.95, was the most disappointing due to too-soft shrimp and a relatively tame/bland sauce.)

Review Text :
This place just opened yesterday (8/6/15).   I had my expectations very low it was a real Philly Steak they served because it's impossible to find here. Those of you that are expecting seasoned beef steak with coarse sat, paprika, ground pepper, Garlic powder, onion powder, and dried thyme.  That's not how the beef is seasoned here.  The owner didn't mind that I asked for a #3 Philly Steak salad without onion.  It had chick peas, diced tomato, and salad dressing was really good!  They're ranch dressing on the side was also very good.  They have White & Orange American cheese. No provolone or mozzarella.After I was done eating my salad I was reaching for an ice cold water from the frig.  Our food was take out and we live 2 miles up the road it wasn't long drive from the backside of Rhodes Ranch Golf Community.  I would go back again and try their chicken kabobs with a side of rice for $6.99. We came in around 7:15 pm on a Friday night (8/7/15).  We even ordered one of the specials for $2.99 on the back of the flyer to try. They have flyers at the register too. Great Customer service, food was hot and made to order. Very squeaky clean.  Love their open patio, it's very nice place and reasonably priced. Cheap eats.The menu is chaotic: gyros and burritos and salads and kabobs, not to mention the namesake philly steaks. But the kabobs aren't available in steak and the gyros aren't available in lamb. But they do currently have a well-priced salmon kabob special ($11).Considering the very mixed reviews for the phillys, I opted for salads here. The gyro salad was a handful of lettuce, three strips of meat, and three or four cucumber and tomato pieces. The takeout box was half empty. The additional Greek salad my friend ordered had no feta. Seriously? Restaurant is a walkup counter. Large patio for outdoor seating. Prices are low. A guy dining in exclaimed that he was from Philadelphia and the food was rockin'. I'm underwhelmed enough with the salads to be disinterested in trying more options. YMMV.

Review Text :
Sigh. Last night could've been great. Though the company was wonderful, our collective experience at Pan was not. Our party of six arrived early last night, but were taken before our reservation without any trouble. As it turned out, the dining room was empty, save for the tables outside, so a reservation likely wasn't necessary to begin with (just a tip in case you plan on going). Our server was hyper-friendly and took our drink and food orders quickly. All but one of us took advantage of Pan's awesome Restaurant Week special - a Bowl and a Roll for $20.15.  It seemed too good to be true. We started with the Rolls, each chosen from their delectable menu of maki.  I chose the Key Lime roll complete with scallops and spicy tuna.  Among our party there was a Dragon roll (eel, tempura something, etc.), a Green roll (vegetarian), and one roll that just couldn't make it to the table for some reason. We waited. And waited some more. Finally, I dug into my roll, all the while giving my friend the "I'm sorry" side-eye. My roll was absolutely delicious.  His arrived well after we all finished, with little explanation.  The server did mention there was a delay shortly after we received our orders, but after that, he didn't say much else.  Finally, the roll arrived and we chalked it up to newbie Restaurant Week jitters. Next up were our order of Bowls. I opted for the Drunken Noodle bowl (more scallops and wide noodles), while the others chose a variety from Pan's good-lookin' bowl menu. Five bowls arrived, but not the sixth. Are you kidding? Though the guest in question kept his cool I was close to busting my chopsticks over my knee and storming out. I didn't, and ate my bowl in quiet frustration instead. It was okay. The bowl reports across the board were that they were bland, so "roll" all the way if you decide to visit Pan.  After at least 15 minutes, the final bowl arrived and the server admitted it was his fault. Thanks, but too little too late. His meal was comped, his drinks weren't and we all left with very little chance of ever returning.  Hopefully, these issues are just a flash in the "Pan," for all you Yelpers out there, but I won't be among you. There are too many other great options in this amazing city.P.S. The new layout in the dining room leaves a lot to be desired. I wasn't obsessed with Tamari, but at least they had a nice collection of booths and tables. If I want one long picnic table I'll go to the park.I miss Tamari a lot, so I had to check out what PAN was all about. Two friends and I had dinner here at 9pm on a Saturday night. Wasn't crowded at all. We shared the Angry Snapper sushi roll and all liked it a lot. It's perfect for those who can handle just a little bit of spicy, but might be slightly disappointing for those who are expecting a lot of spicy. We were almost going to order seconds, but decided to save room for our entrees. I got the braised pork belly, which my friends thought was really good. I thought it was alright; couldn't eat too much of it for some reason, probably because I wasn't a fan of the butternut squash it was served over. If it had ginger in it, the taste was too strong. If there was no ginger in it, then I have no idea what it was. (I know there was cinnamon and nutmeg in it though because that's what the chef said.) One of my friends got the pan pho and said the broth and meat were bad but noodles were good. The other had the drunken noodles and said they were good but too salty. When we were ready for dessert and inquired about the menu, we were disappointed to hear from our server that she didn't have anything for us. Well...okay. Not even an explanation of why no dessert was available? Awkward end to our meal. Awkward end to this review. (I'd much prefer Tamari.)Taste | 3Atmosphere | 3Presentation | 4Service | 3.5OVERALL | 3

I'm so excited Zoës is closer to me now. Today is the grand opening and it was a little busy around noon, but it was flowing nicely. They are giving away cups for your drink and you can get free refills for the month. I ordered the chicken kabob with the Greek salad and a side of quinoa (new item) it was good!  I also had a side of the hummus. Can't wait to come back.

Review Text :
Officially open September 1st, Chickpeas is the newest Mediterranean spot in Vegas. Food is fresh and flavorful, and there's covered patio seating.  Menu has all the usual favorites: shwarma, tabouli, hummus, pita. Meats are available as plates, sandwiches, or (allegedly) on salads. They also offer breakfast.I was thrilled to see Oliviet (Russian potato salad) on the menu! Unfortunately they were out of it on my most recent visit. Menu has no clear appetizers section- cashier had some difficulty adding a small order of falafel, as the menu only offers it as a plate or sandwich. Ordering "Greek salad with chicken shwarma" got me a side salad and a shwarma wrap, which isn't what I had in mind (salad topped with meat).Ordering issues and new-opening kinks aside, the space is clean and organized. The falafel is soft and flavorful inside, but could be a bit crisper on the outside. It came with an ample portion of tahini sauce. The greek salad was tasty (heads up that it's pre-dressed) and the veggies were fresh. The shwarma wrap was nicely seasoned, and had a good amount of tomatoes and red onion, and a generous portion of meat. Unfortunately, the pita itself was falling apart before we were halfway though, which got messy.

Someone once said "No one chooses to go to Denny's, they just end up there."  I somehow ended up at a restaurant serving raw vegan.  Hey!  They don't have to cook any of it!  This should come out quick! haaaaaWhen I used to live in NYC, there was a semi well known "Juice Bar" on St Mark's for a while that was a front for selling illegal things.  Walking into this pretty empty space totally reminded me of that.  Aside from the salad bar in the center of the relatively big room, one would be hard pressed to tell if the restaurant was coming or going.  There was a sushi display case at the rear counter from probably like 4 businesses ago and a bar on the right that looked like it hadn't seen a patron in years.  With its basement type ambiance, Go Vegan Café is clearly a takeout type eatery.  I doubt a person that lives this type of lifestyle cares about any of that since a lack of vegan options in the neighborhood would totally supersede atmosphere.The "Raw Portobello Burger" with its nut patty (made with almonds, sunflower seeds, sun-dried tomatoes, ginger, & carrots) was better than expected.  The creaminess of the almond "cheese" and avocado made for a more than passable garden sandwich.  The onion rawtilla bun wasn't flimsy at all and held everything together nicely.  The "fries" were simply 3 slices of breaded avocado hmmmm. My wife liked her "Veggie Wrap" which was basically a reshaped salad as collard greens were used as the tortilla.  The house slaw that came with her dish with its unique dressing was the tastiest thing we had.  Two dishes and veggie juice came out to $37, yet both of us were still hungry later.  Wanting to stay consistent with the whole raw evening, I ate a couple of bananas later on.  There's really no rush for me to return, but if I find myself on one of those beefx5 kind of weeks, this would be a good way to change up the eating cycle.Even if the raw vegan lifestyle isn't for you, the food here is fresh, fun, great tasting, and good for you! Plus it's the best kind of takeout ever, since you don't have to worry about it getting cold. ;)There are "raw" and just vegan items available- the raw burgers (portabello on nut patty!) and collard wraps (mexican and italian-style!) are my favorites though, both served with avocado "fries". If you want a liquid lunch, they have a massive selection of smoothies and shakes, as well as fresh young coconuts.Location is a bit odd: you cash out at the hostess stand rather than the back bakery counter or the large ground counter where the staff sit. There's a huge salad bar ($9/lb) in the middle of the dining room with a small supplement shop area to the right, and the "small talk garden" area to the back. There's just a lot going on and not much in the way of decor. I guess all their focus and energy are busy in the kitchen!I am not a Vegan by any stretch of the imagination, so my knowledge of this foodie world is lacking, with that being said, I found the food here to be very flavorful and filling. Walking-in it's very plain on the inside, looking like a half finished school cafeteria with a small grocery section selling vegan or vegetarian products. I sat down and realized I was the only person in here, which can be creepy. The menu is overwhelming, as there's a lot to choose from, to make matters worse, I wasn't really given any guidance on how to tackle it, so I went with the Lentil Loaf sandwich and the Roasted Veggie quesadilla. The Lentil Loaf was good, but a little on the dry side. It needed some type of sauce to moisten it up. The menu said it comes with BBQ sauce, but there was little to no sauce on this sammie. This was very filling and if you're looking for heavy meal, this is a good option. The Roasted Veggie Quesadilla had a lot more flavor, but it was greasy! Like needing to wash my hands after every bite, greasy. There was cheese on this, dairy free cheese, and to be honest, the difference wasn't ultra noticeable and I actually liked it. The roasted veggies still had a snap to them and a little heat that slowly escalated with every bite. Good stuff!The design and the service here needs a huge upgrade, I only received one glass of water, which I had to ask for and was checked on only twice during the entire meal. Go Vegan needs to work on these things if they want to prosper in their not so great location.

Review Text :
I'm excited about this new place! So far based on the two drinks I had, the service, and the environment, this place is getting 5 stars! Grabbed drinks here while waiting for a table at Le Thai, and our experience was delightful. We sat at the bar and perused the cocktail menu. There were so many interesting, scrumptious sounding drinks to try, but I went with the Piña Colada, my favorite. This one had a particular appeal because it included banana liquor, which I thought would be a nice touch. My husband ordered the Smash. Both of the drinks were so unique and refreshing. Not super sweet and not super heavy. Very light, delicate flavors and very beautifully presented (see photos for presentation obviously). The service was great. Our bartender was very friendly and willing to answer all questions about the menu and was just an all around cool person. He had a lot to share with us about the chef, the inspired food and drinks and just regular human conversations. As we were walking by the window of the restaurant a few hours later, he waved at us. The fact that he remembered us is huge for me. When I worked in the restaurant business it was rare that I could remember a person. But he did. It means a lot to be treated like new friends than just customers. Piña Colada: I love this drink. I am always ordering Piñas and this one was very different from the Las Vegas poolside original. It was not super sweet and didn't feel like I was drinking a milkshake (which is a good thing in this case). The banana liquor added a different dimension to the drink and gave it an added tropical feeling. They finished it off with some shredded coconut on top, and i think there was some in the bottom of my drink as well, which was a nice surprise at the end. All in all, I really loved it. The Smash: This one has all the things my husband loves "smashed" into one glass. The fresh blackberries muddled in the bottom of the glass with fresh mint leaves creates a refreshing, light, sweet combo. Its almost like an adult blackberry lemonade. It is one of the fan favorites so far. My husband loved it as well. We didn't have a chance to try the food yet, but I took a glance at the menu and there are about a million things on there that I would LOVE to order. So I will be back and add to this review, for sure!Joining a growing list of DTLV eateries, Therapy. has some inventive dishes and new takes on others.  Items served:Oxtail empanadas with lime crème fraîcheSoft pretzel bread with spicy beer mustardIn the "gnudi"Roasted Mexican street cornAssorted mushroom flatbread with smoked bacon, caramelized onion and soft cooked eggRed velvet waffle slidersHangar steak tartarCrispy fried pig ears with truffle honey mustard sauceRoasted cauliflower with dates and yellow curryCast iron s'mores with semi-sweet chocolate and bacon marshmallowsCrumbled carrot cakeGreeted by the general manager, Chuck Scimeca, we were quickly seated and brought water and I ordered an iced tea.  We were asked if we wanted to order items from the menu or have the chef send out items he chose.  After looking at the menu, we opted for them to make the choices for us but we had a few requests--items they had already planned for us to have.  During our dinner, Chef Daniel Ontiveros, formerly at Comme Ça, came to the table to talk about some of the dishes and his plans for the menu in the future.  I saw him several times stopping at tables to chat with customers.Outstanding dishes were the gnudi--baked ricotta, truffle honey, fig jam, roasted almonds & cranberry and walnut crostini.  The jam and almonds with the baked cheese on the crostini was excellent!  The Mexican street corn was very good.  I'll go for this anytime.  The assorted mushroom flatbread was very different.  Instead of being a standard flatbread crust, it was instead a puff pastry crust.  The char on the pastry was perfect without being burnt.  The soft cooked egg mixed onto the flatbread added to the flavor of the mushrooms and bacon.  The last two items were ones we asked for and were good choices.  The baked cauliflower with China Ranch dates and yellow curry was excellent!  The light curry flavor was very good.  Finally, the pig ears were so much different than others I've had.  These were meatier instead of being a thin slice of pig ear.  The honey mustard dipping sauce with them was very tasty.The two desserts were quite good.  The s'mores with bacon marshmallows on top of a graham cracker crust in the cast iron container was a fun dish--a perfect example of Chef Ontiveros's slant on a dish that's available in area restaurants--this with a very different twist.  The favorite, however, was the crumbled carrot cake served with cream cheese frosting and a spoon of vanilla ice cream.Service during the evening was excellent.  My iced tea was replaced with a fresh glass before I  was done with the previous and the servers were all pleasant and efficient.  One negative for me--the music was loud at times and it almost overwhelmed our conversation.  Therapy. is very close to being a five star review. We were not presented a check.  The servers were taken care of instead.Therapy. has been open for just over a month and things are running very smoothly.  It was with a very full stomach that we walked back to the garage where we'd parked.  I'll be back to Therapy. soon!Recently opened in the white-hot Fremont East district, an interesting decision given the established gastro-pub offerings of Park, Glutton, Carson Kitchen and more, it was at the suggestion of two trusted palates that dinner at "Therapy." was booked, the menu seemingly featuring all the right words with execution left to Chef Daniel Ontiveros in his debut role as head toque in a restaurant off The Strip.Long in layout and two-stories tall, the space formerly inhabited by a Dollar Store completely renovated with a sexy bar and exposed ceilings as an open kitchen operates towards the back, it was at the hostess stand that we met the GM and swiftly led to a tidy four-top at the center of the restaurant the option of dining a la carte or letting the Chef cook for the table was offered, the later obviously accepted with a few special requests.Admittedly allowing a friend of the house to arrange the reservation, and unexpectedly presented with no check at night's end, it was with service proving not only friendly but exceedingly well-informed and efficient that the meal began; a plate of soft pretzels set beside a quartet of oxtail empanadas, the former unequivocally buttery and luscious while the latter found surprising levity when dipped in peppery crème fraîche.Sipping a stiff yet fruity frozen drink, and later treated to a tasting of signature sangrias from which the Elder-Melon iteration proved an on-point summer refresher, it was with good pacing that round two arrived a few minutes after opening plates were finished and although the citrus kissed street corn was certainly no slouch there is little sense arguing that the star of the show was in fact the absolutely irresistible ricotta dumplings entitled "in the gnudi," a gooey bite both sweet and savory that wows equally when eaten like gnocchi or spread on crostini, an item already rivaling the best appetizers in the city and a midpoint contender for the year's ten best bites.At this point seeing lights lowered as a pop-heavy soundtrack switched to Taylor Swift at a volume that seemed a bit unnecessary given the growing din of the crowd, it was onward to a flaky puff-pastry 'flatbread' topped with mushrooms and a soft-poached egg that the savories marched on, and with a shocking degree of smoke imbued in the crust given the use of an electric oven each slice was slowly savored, a follow-up jar of silky steak tartar on par with what should be expected while the whimsical red-velvet sliders were unfortunately a bit muddled by all the accoutrements, a bit less slaw or more brine to the bird needed to add balance while the 'bun' would have been better off crisp.At this point a bit full, but unable to resist tasting a few more savories before moving onto dessert, it was with good fortune that a request was made to sample the meatiest pig's ears tasted to date, and yet as delicious as the indulgent strips were it was perhaps a bit of a surprise that the charred yellow cauliflower presented even bolder, the use of curry, dates, as well as nuts offering a great degree of balance and giving one hope of great things to come when Ontiveros launches a market-driven blackboard in the months to come.Told that sweets at Therapy. are something not to be missed it was after a short visit from the Chef that the meal would reach its end, and again treated to a duo one would be hard pressed to decide whether the cast iron s'mores or deconstructed carrot cake was better, each creamy spoonful of the first exceptionally decadent despite being nicely anchored by a graham cracker base while the crumbled semicircle of spice cake was unquestionably more elegant, each bite offering something slightly different when paired to ice cream and airy cream cheese.Still new, but already executing at a high level from the kitchen to the front of house staff, Therapy. marks yet another success for East Fremont, an area where things may indeed seem 'same-same' on the surface, while a deeper shows Chefs like Ontiveros instead pushing new concepts in an attempt to evolve the scene, and perhaps even swing the pendulum away from the strip and thereby change the game.Cool lounge with some quality food, nice spot for something new on Fremont. It was too early in the day to drink, so I popped in for some apps: the Social Club portion of the menu is tapas-style but the portion sizes don't really lend themselves to much in the way of sharing.OXTAIL EMPANADAS: Delightful outer shell, great flavor on the actual oxtail, but it was a bit on the dry side. Those corner bites where the grease and juices collected were pretty great, though. This was served with a harissa-lime crème fraiche dipping sauce that had more color than flavor and did not add anything to the flavors of the dish itself. HANGAR STEAK TARTARE: A passable classic version, but not one of the better ones in town. Good selection of pickled veggies, four crisp slices of grilled bread, and a reasonable portion, but not something I'd necessarily get again.Even with just the two dishes I tried, the menu shows some promise. I'll have to come back with a few friends to try more, particularly the In the Gnudi, as my dining partner this visit is unable to eat ricotta. Service was friendly and attentive without being pushy, bartender was happy to suggest a few of her favorite dishes.It's just bar food, but good bar food. There are many options in Vegas for an "upscale" bar food experience, but sadly most of these spots fall pretty short when it comes to delivery. Therapy isn't reinventing the wheel here, but they are making a better, tastier, and more attractive place to hang with friends. The location is great, smack dab in the middle of a bustling Downtown Las Vegas great for both tourist and locals alike. I came here after attending the Las Vegas Film Festival and instantly loved the decor and flow of this place. There are no walls in the place, you can literally see into the bar, kitchen, and upstairs dining area from anywhere on the lower level. My guest and I weren't super hungry so we went with a smattering shareable food items found on the, "Social Club" menu section. The Oxtail Empanadas, The Chicken Meatballs, Roasted Curry Cauliflower and Mixed mushroom Flatbread. From the best to the not so best... The Oxtail Empanadas, our server Georgie suggested these amazing little pockets of tender meat. Lite crispy pouches filled to the brim with slowed cooked shredded meat, a must order! Thanks Georgie! The Mixed Mushroom Flatbread. Mushrooms, truffle oil, cheese, all on flattened puff pastry. This was a little heavy on the truffle oil, but was still very tasty. I really enjoyed the bacon cut into cubes rather than diced strips. Comes with a soft boiled egg for all that runny goodness! Roasted Cauliflower. Solid curry flavor especially when paired with dates. Cooked perfect with a light snap as you bit into them. The Chicken meatballs were just ok. They were a tad bland and dry, so thank goodness it came with a cilantro pesto. I pretty much had to drown the meatball in this tasty sauce. This might be a one-time thing so maybe I'll try this on my next visit. This place is definitely worth a try even if you just pop in for a quick cocktail and snack.My anxiety can only be cured by food. What better place to get that taken care of that than Therapy. The diners are your typical local downtown hipsters. The service was good.The decription of menu items seemed all so delicious. We gave a few items a try...In the "Gnudi":Fig jam, baked ricotta, truffle honey, roasted almonds, arugula on cranberry walnut crostini. They look like takoyaki with grilled bread on the side. Different textures and flavors in a simple dish. Sweetness from the fig jam and honey, the peppery taste from the arugula, the smokey flavor from the grilled crostini, the mild taste and creaminess from the ricotta, and the crunch from the almonds. 4/5Oxtail Empanadas:Empanadas filled with oxtail with lime creme fraiche. Split the empanada in half to release the steam from the hot and juicy oxtail pieces then dip in creme fraiche. I just wish there was more of the tasty filling. 3.5/5Chicken and Red Velvet Waffle Slider:Crispy chicken breast with a red pepper remoulade in between red velvet Belgian waffles, with syrup on the side. The chicken itself was nice and crunchy without being heavy on the batter. The remoulade adds heat and tang but the sweet syrup with a hint of alcohol balances it out. I tried to eat this with my hands but the waffles weren't stable enough to hold the heavy chicken and the wet remoulade. Definitely eat with a fork and knife. 4/5The French Dip:Roasted prime beef, horseradish cream on a grilled hoagie with truffle chips on the side. I haven't had a good beef sandwich in this country since I moved out of the MidWest. The jus is more like a gravy as it's thicker than your average jus but honestly, you won't even need it. The truffle chips were amazing. They weren't oily and they were freshly-made. They definitely taste like truffles. 5/5I wanted to give the Roasted Jidori Chicken, Shrimp Scampi, and Filet Frites a try but I guess I would have to come back for more Therapy.When comparing the hot triple threat of New American eats in DTLV, Therapy reluctantly gets the bronze medal by a few tenths of a point.  It's still worthy, offering things the others don't, like cozier seating, a nice sized bar, and the only place on the block with big TV's for sports.  But despite a few interesting menu twists, their dishes either match similarly in quality to their competitors or fall a bit short, but never really surpass.         The "Crispy Fried Pig Ears" are presented like a bride's bouquet at a high end redneck wedding.  This group friendly dish came a lot crispier with less breading on my most recent visit, which I felt to be not as good as my initial time; it still magically disappeared though.  The truffle honey mustard dipping sauce is kind of gross, so I just eat them straight, preferably with a large glass of Hamm's.  Another great partner with beer is "Popcorn".  The fried peanuts and maple candied bacon make for wonderful companions, but sharing this with actual companions is slightly awkward since you'll basically be eating bits that were touched, but unsuccessfully attempted to be picked up, by others when diving in for their handful.  I wanted chopsticks!  A bigger bowl with a mini shovel would work better.  I'd like a couple of hits of whatever the chef was smoking when he thought of this one.   The "Chicken and Red Velvet Waffle Slider" is an eye catcher with all its color, but a crispier waffle would have made for a functional sandwich instead of sloppiness on a plate.  The fried chicken itself was crispy and very juicy.  I would have been down with just a bucket of that.  Definitely worth returning for, but I'll be eating this all deconstructed with a fork and knife next time.One dish to be avoided is the "Roasted Cauliflower".  The extreme char masked any signs of seasoning.  That place on Carson that starts with a "G" does an incredible version of this.  Get the excellent "Street Corn" instead or save the extra bucks (and room) for one of Therapy's great desserts like carrot cake or smores.  3.7623235799213 stars.It's neat to see what Therapy has become, especially considering where it started. What used to be a complete dump of a horrible tourist gift shop is now one of the nicer lounge type restaurants in the area. Not only does Therapy have a full bar if you're looking to just stop in for a drink, but there are dining areas both downstairs and upstairs. It's another great example of the revitalization of downtown.Our first visit here was a somewhat short one. We had just finished dinner around the corner, and decided to stop in for a drink. Alongside a handful of beers on tap, they have a few signature cocktails and house-made sangrias. For the ridiculously hot days in Vegas, they even offer some frozen drinks. I decided to give The Smash! a shot after hearing good things about it, but unfortunately wasn't a huge fan. The bourbon was there, but not much of it and completely masked by the blackberry and sweetened lime. On our next visit, we sat down with a party of about 10 and ordered up about as much as we could on the menu. Much like the direction many new restaurants are taking, Therapy has two sections of the menu called "The Social Club" and "Bites" which focus on shareable plates. Of the 15 items between the two sections, we ended up ordering 10 of them.A few things that stood out for me were the Chicken & Red Velvet Waffle Sliders, Shrimp Ceviche and the Hangar Steak Tartar. The chicken and waffle sliders are actually pretty big and if ordered alone could probably be a dinner for some. I liked the large, juicy piece of chicken and the mild sweetness from the waffle. It also has a spicy remoulade that adds a nice little kick. And while the ceviche was real heavy on the tomato flavor, but mild on the citrus, I still enjoyed it. It was fresh, bright and flavorful. As far as the tartar goes, I think i was one of the few at our table who enjoyed it. I haven't had tartar at many restaurants, but I liked the seasoning in addition to the egg and crispy grilled bread. We didn't order a whole lot from the larger plates, but we did have a couple items that are worth mentioning. The Charred Kale is an excellent salad that was really one of the top items of the night. It had amazing flavor and I loved both the fresh egg and bacon smoked bacon vinaigrette topping it. Another surprising favorite was The French Dip. This sandwich is not the typical dry bread, low quality meat and oily ju that you find almost everywhere else. The flavors were spot on, the meat was tender and juicy, and the sandwich as a whole just had the right amount of heat from the horseradish. It's also served with crispy chips that have a present, but deliciously addicting truffle flavor. To finish out the night, we ordered 3 out of their 4 desserts. The Cast Iron Smores was crazy sweet, and could definitely benefit from a little more bacon to offset that. Both the Crumbled Carrot Cake and Pure Decadence chocolate cake were much better, but still probably not something I'd order again. I did really enjoy the brown butter ice cream though that was on the carrot cake, and would probably order that alone if it was offered.Because we ordered nearly 20 items from the menu and only a few were things I'd come back for, I don't think I'd rush back. We also had less than stellar service. For whatever reason, our waiter forgot to put in an order of the Cheddar Mac & Cheese, which was something quite a few of our party was anticipating. She admitted to forgetting it, but after asking her to still put the order in, she either forgot again, or blew it off. This was basically towards the end of our meal too, and we had already asked for it twice before that. Shortly after, we watched another table next to us get an order of it, then our table was cleaned off and she started asking about dessert. Luckily she remembered to take it off the bill, but it was still frustrating to miss a dish that was asked for multiple times.After 2 visits, I'm still a bit torn on Therapy. They've definitely got a lot to offer, and it's another great addition to the "New Downtown", but some things just fall a little short to bump this up to 4 stars.Went here for a lunch outing with a company I worked for during the summer. It was a few days after Therapy opened in July. I drove by Therapy this morning and was reminded of my awful experience and felt compelled to share. I walked by Therapy a few weeks before the lunch outing and heard Dead Kennedys' "California Uber Alles" blaring from their doorstep at 11 a.m., so I had a positive initial impression. Our party of close to two dozen was seated at a long table in the back. The decor was wood and metal and the kitchen was open which added to the homey, comfortable vibe. Two waitresses were taking care of us. I looked through the menu with my vegan lenses and narrowed it down to three items; a salad, a flatbread or a side. I wanted something filling with a variety of flavors so I decided on the summer squash flatbread and ordered it without cheese. I informed the waitress upon ordering that I cannot have meat or dairy and she said she was nearly certain my order would suit my needs, but if there was an issue she would let me know.The entrees came out and the waitress informed me the dough for the flatbread contained dairy. Since the entrees had already arrived, I asked her what other menu items I could have. She frantically looked at the menu for a few minutes and suggested the mixed greens salad without Parmesan. I didn't want to waste any more time so I agreed. I was pretty disappointed since I was looking forward to something filling and toothsome. I remembered I had stashed a trusty and incredibly tasty Trader Joe's $3.99 vegan BBQ chicken wrap in the fridge at work the day before so I was less annoyed since I wouldn't have to be hungry for the rest of the work day. The salad was the most pathetic plate I've seen in a while. Half the plate was empty and the salad was dressed spring mix and a few radish slices. The owner came by after I had a few bites and asked the group which dishes everyone enjoyed. People replied with this and that and he asked one of my coworkers what he thought of the mac and cheese. "I'm lactose intolerant so I couldn't try it," he replied. The owner said with a chuckle, "Well you don't matter." I saw a few people look my way and the owner quickly walked away from the awkward silence after his comment. I was taken aback and frankly insulted that a restaurant owner in downtown Las Vegas would say that customers who can't eat dairy don't matter. Even as a joke. The absence of vegan items, besides some overpriced spring mix, made a lot more sense after his comment. By no means do I think they need to do a menu overhaul. The dishes that came out looked very creative and fun (like the red velvet waffles and chicken), but in a neighborhood where you can get various dairy-free lattes, vegan nachos, vegan pizza and vegan donuts asserting people who can't have dairy don't matter is asinine.It's unfortunate that Daniel Ontiveros left, but if the new executive chef can lead the kitchen as well as his predecessor, Therapy will continue to be a quality spot Downtown and is already one of the most beautiful spaces in the area. They spent a pretty penny on this build out and the quality shows. More upscale than surrounding restaurants but still a casual environment perfect for hanging out with friends or for a date night. I stopped by a couple times earlier in the summer and both visits showcased well crafted dishes where the smaller, shareable plates shined. They have some classic dishes like steak tartare made with hangar steak and chicken and waffles using crisp and airy red velvet waffles. Latin inspired dishes can be found on the menu. Street corn charred and smothered with cheese, a lime aioli and a subtle kick from chili peppers makes for some good bites. As do savory, rich, and slightly oily oxtail empanadas or an order of shrimp ceviche and chips.The most successful items were also the most unique. Fried pig ears were a first for me, but I walked away a fan of its crispy exterior and chewy (almost like biting into a fig) texture. Their "In the gnudi" dish was also a hit. Although slightly sweet with a fig jam and cranberries, spreading the baked ricotta and topping on top of the accompanying walnut crostini created an enticing array of tastes and textures.Both flatbreads I tried -- the summer squash and mixed mushroom flatbreads -- were equally outstanding where the buttery, flakey pastry-like crust stood out as the star of both dishes.The biggest letdowns were the limp popcorn and salty and dry chicken meatballs. Aside from those missteps I'd have to say that Therapy has lots of promise, provided that the changes in the kitchen don't hold them back.

Review Text :
I am so glad that Rotana is open! I love their selection of food. Not many places to get Lebanese or Armenian dishes. The hummus with chicken shawarma is fantastic. I love the mixed grill with lamb, chicken kabob, and kafta.The Labna dip has a hint of spice, it pairs well with any meat. The rice is good. Comparable to most other places. It was fresh. I ordered takeout 3 nights in a row. No complaints, my order was correct, it was a normal wait time, and each item was a good sized portion to generous.It has been remodeled inside. Only one large booth, the rest are tables. 2 patios to enjoy this gorgeous autumn weather. They have many flavors of shisha for hookah enthusiasts. There is an area for live music inside as well, ask for details. Looks like a full bar too. Currently offering a yelp deal. Healthy choices for kids meals also. I'll be back many times.Happy hour- appetizers 3pm-6 or 7pm, I only glanced at the sign. To be updated.How do I write this review without sounding so cliche?How do I avoid using those annoying phrases like "to die for" and "the best ever"?How can I say my words without an over use of exclamation points? (My grammar teacher will snap the ruler against my knuckles!)Well if I can't say it, give me a canvas so I can paint a picture.You know that feeling when you have a good thing going? You want to capture THAT exactly as it is and not have one iota change. Well...I want this restaurant to stay open always. I want that chef to be there forever.I don't want the menu to change ever.Folks at the table were humming with joy and shimmying to the middle eastern music coming from the wide screens. I, myself, wanted to crawl into the basket of warm pita bread and hibernate there for the winter. And let me tell you neither a beggar nor borrower I be, but for this review I'm begging you to borrow some cash and support this wonderful restaurant, Rotana. It's Located on Greenway Parkway just past 7th Street and across the drive thru of Wells Fargo. In all honesty, this is the best Mediterranean food I've eaten. It's to die for!Whew.There are multiple veggie options on the menu (full color and pictorial) and although most of them are listed as appetizers, you can easily make a meal out of two items and leave satiated. The dishes we ordered were simple but deliciously filled with an abundance of incredible flavor. Everything tasted as if it had been made-to-order. I think there was a solo operation going on in the kitchen because our plates came out one at a time. But it's all for one and one for all at our table so even though sharing the first dish was obligatory, as other plates arrived and covered the table in goodness we were all happily chomping on our own dishes and finished eating around the same time. Here's what the vegetarians ordered:Hummus - $5.50Yummy, creamy. Just fancied up with a topping of whole chickpeas, olive oil, and flavor. Baba Ghanouj - $6.50The menu says "smoked to perfection" and I wholeheartedly agree. The eggplant was perfectly smooth, tasty, topped with tomato garnish, olive oil, and flavor.M'jadara - $5.00Lentils with rice, topped with crispy onions and flavor.Normally I would not have liked this dish because the rice was mushy combined with the texture of the lentils, but it was delicious. I actually dug in and ate a few spoonfuls. If you like beans and rice, order it.Roasted brussels sprouts - $5.00Tossed with cranberries. Not crunchy, yet firm. Yeh to firm green veggies. I was impressed with the melange. Muhammara - $5.50My first time hearing of this dish. It's a red pepper paste mixed with walnuts. The menu claimed "spicy red pepper" and although one person at the table tasted some heat, all I got was a mouthful of saltiness. Too salty for my taste, but I liked it paired with the m'jadara and brussels sprouts. Fattoush rotana salad - $7.00Wow. This salad was the most complicated looking dish on the table. Like a kaleidoscope - purple, orange, red, all shades of greens, there may have been yellow too. Piled with several ingredients and topped with fried pita, flavorful dressing, and some delicious seasoning that I've never tasted before. I. Wanted. To. Lick. The. Salad. Are you hearing me?Lick. It.Falafel - $6.00Thankfully the fritters were not oily, but unfortunately their texture was dry and uneventful. If there exists a falafel spectrum in the universe, it must only read "dry" on one end and "oily" on the opposite end with nothing in-between because I've only had falafel either dry or oily. Haven't found a restaurant yet that has found a balance. Skip it.Vegetarian burger - $6.00An overgrown falafel in burger clothes. Normally that would be okay, but this falafel was dry, so unless you like it like that, skip it.

It's quick.  It's cheap.  And let's be honest.  They finally did something with a long standing vacant building.When you walk in, you order at the counter where they make your food assembly style to order.  I stopped in last Friday and walked away with a carnitas torta.  The carnitas were full of pork goodness and tender to the bite.  Topped with your choice of toppings and under $8, it was a solid lunch.It was a hard sell for me since my favorite Mexican spot is right down the street, but Both of my stops here have been great and I will definitely be coming back for more. The staff is extremely friendly, the food has tons of flavor, great portions, and the cheese sauce and spicy onions are ridiculous.

Fresh, fast Mediterranean style food. I can't say I'd choose this spot over table service, but it seems good enough for a quick stop or a lunch. You tell them what you want, double meat? There's an option for that, top it with hummus, tatziki, jalapeños, peprocini, cucumber and more. They cater too. I'd stop in again if I lived or worked in the area :-)Happy yelping! ... Gilbert, Mesa, or wherever I am. ;-)

I'm not from the Great White North and I've only had a few Americanized versions of poutine- I wouldn't know if the version served here is legit or not. But I can tell you that it is good.The snack-size traditional poutine is amply sized and priced ($6) for the name, and comes with fresh, skin-on fries topped with layers of fresh cheese curds and a splash of gravy. I do like that they layered the toppings so the bottom half of the order was not dry and boring. The fries were sauced just right so they were nicely soft but not soggy. Flavor in the gravy itself was lighter than expected but still savory and enjoyable.Props for having vegetarian options available! I'd opt to stick to the namesake traditional poutine dish here over others, because the rest of the menu contains cheese-fry, chili-fry, and taco-themed concoctions that seem more on par with a bar or fast food restaurant.

There are so many restaurants in Montreal that I wish to check out but sadly I don't have enough time (or frankly money if we are being truthful). For the part 3 years, the October-November event of MTL à Table has allowed me to get to certain restaurants at a reduced price which I am very thankfully for. When I first looked at the restaurants participating this year, the one that leaped off the page for me was Lili Co. Originally a small Plateau restaurant, partners Catherine Draws and David Pellizzari moved into a bigger space on Saint-Laurent earlier this year. Reading the big reviews they have gotten over the past few years - including a most recent one in the Gazette in July - Lili Co.'s use of offal and off-cuts really intrigued me and had me pinning for a visit. Sadly, the MTL à Table menu didn't have any of that - unless you paid a little extra - but I still wanted to go and give them a try.Visually, Lili Co. is a nice clean space. The main focus is on the two wrap-around bars which circle both the bar area and the open kitchen where you can watch Chef David and his crew do their work. In fact, outside of a few spots - including where we were sadly! - the entire room is set up to face the kitchen. Service was quick and efficient. Noise level was pretty loud given the room was full. As such, there was background music throughout the night but I honestly couldn't tell you what it was. It is not the most fancy room around but sharp nevertheless.I felt like a cocktail this evening so I tried one of their seasonal specialities - The "Sans nom d'automne" - zubrowska, cachaca, natural apple juice, teapot bitters and star anise. I like this one in theory but the flavour left me indifferent. The sweetness of the cachaca and the apple juice were not noticeable. I was left primarily with the bitterness and the zubrowska - not really I had hoped for.With the cocktail consumed, we moved on the food. First up was the pork belly served with cashew butter and creamy coleslaw. A generous peace of fatty pork with a nice crispiness to the skin. The creamy coleslaw paired well with the meat. The cashew butter was nice as well.Our other starter was wild mushrooms poached in butter served with caramelized cauliflower purée and black bread crumbs. A simple dish but so well executed and delicious. The mushrooms were soften slightly with their wonderful earthiness intact. The real star though was the cauliflower puree - so rich and smooth. Very enjoyable.Our second course started with Gnocchi à la fajiole served with romano beans, smoked tomatoes and parmigiana. A nice creamy sauce paired well with the pillowy gnocchi and the beans. Only complaint would be the portion size - definitely would have been nice to have a few extra gnocchi!The second main was grilled octopus with a hibiscus glaze, chorizo, soy beans, black olive powder and lemon. The hit of the evening for us. The mixture of the glaze and the chorizo gave the tender octopus a hint of both sweetness and spiciness. The soy beans added a little extra sustenance to the plate. Definitely a dish I would order again.For dessert, we were treated to house doughnuts with lemon mousse and huckleberry jam. The doughnuts were light and fluffy in the inside with a nice crunch on the outside. Add the sugar coating to the jam and the mousse and you have a nice dessert right there. The final dessert was a brioche with a nut beurre monté, sumac and a wild flower glace au miel. Just like the doughnuts, the brioche was nice and fluffy. The special touches of the beurre monté and the glace au miel provided some nice sweetness and richness.I'll admit I was disappointed that no offal or off-cut dishes were present in the menu option - since that is what attracted me to Lili Co in the first place - but in the end, that is on me for having waiting until MTL à Table to finally visit Lili Co. The food was excellent and the atmosphere enjoyable - you can see why they needed to move into bigger digs this year. This meal simply reinforced that I will need to come back again. Looking forward to visiting chef David and Catherine on a more regular occasion.Cheers!

When you walk in to Freiburg, it feels like you are walking into a set for a german themed movie.  The interior feels gimmicky and tries way too hard on being "German".  And quite honestly, the same can be said about the food.  Yes, they use German words for their entrees.  Yes, they feature German beers.  But the execution of the dishes falls flat, real flat.  Let's start with the beer.  I am impressed with the variety and options featured but not impressed with the glassware used.  Yes, it's branded to the beer you are drinking but their sizes are laughable.  If you have "pub" in your name, bust out the steins or Maß glasses.For food, we ordered the kasesspatzle and the rinderbraten.  The former is basically Freiburg's play on mac and cheese.  The spaetzle was gummy and came off oily.  The rinderbraten (roast beef and gravy) was ho hum.  The roast beef was not tough but not exactly fall apart tender.  Gravy was fine.  But for $17.95, it didn't bring enough flavor or appeal to ever order again.I doubt I would venture back and I wonder how the Monroe St. crowd will receive them in the long haul.  The area restaurants that have been successful have been ones that serve real and honest food and are authentic about who they are.  This can't be said about Freiburg.

Let's be real. I'm only writing this to get the First to Review because if you've been to one Chipotle, you've been to them all.  ;PAlthough this chain is known for their giant burritos, I like to pretend I'm eating healthy when I get their burrito bowls. Get the sofritas and tell your wee-tots it's ground pork because it's so flavorful, they wouldn't know they're eating tofu. Brown or white rice, black or pinto beans, with or without fajita veggies, sour cream, choice of salsa, and guacamole for an additional fee offered. Choose your poison.This location just opened so it's still super clean. On this Thursday afternoon, 10-12 of the friendliest people were working. I normally go to the location by Chandler Fashion Center but the people here are so much more friendly and down-to-earth. This will be my new fave Chipotle.Yup, it's Chipotle. The interior is nice and the staff are very friendly (Even for a cold dreary Monday haha). Despite getting a burrito with a variety of salsas and cheese, aside from the meat the burrito itself tasted a little bland. The pinto beans were especially lacking in seasoning. I had to pile on the hot sauce to actually get any flavor! The barbacoa was decent, and tasted strongly of cumin. On a good note the burritos themselves are a hefty size and they will gladly pile on various toppings if you ask (I was a pig and asked for pico, corn, and green tomatillo salsa).

The new kid on the block resides in Davis Lake and if you remember the restaurant Bite Your Tongue, the menu will look very familiar to you as those owners are now affiliated with this restaurant.  I decided to avoid the crowd and stopped by for lunch with my son and was very impressed with the quick service and reasonably priced options.  I ordered a kid's meal of fried shrimp, fries and a drink for $6.99 and an order of red beans and rice at $5.99.  Their signature drink is called 'Strango' a blend of strawberry lemonade and mango tea and it is very tasty!  The shrimp were huge for a kids meal and seasoned to perfection and the red beans and rice were excellent as well.  I must admit I was pleasantly surprised that we were in and out in about 45 minutes so lunch it is for me.  We decided to return for brunch after church to try the chicken and sweet potato waffles but we were told they didn't have them today so we left and hopefully they will have them next Sunday.  Also, they have live music almost daily including brunch so check them out if you're in the area.I visited here during my recent trip to Charlotte for Thanksgiving week. I was super hype to hear that it was a Louisiana style restaurant with live music, but after hearing it had recently opened I lowered my expectations somewhat and mentally prepared for some kinks.Well, glad I did that because the kinks were plentiful - but the party at my table was incredible so it took my mind off of it. The gumbo came out quickly, but it wasn't hot. I was too hungry to complain and overall, it was tasty. The rest of the food took over an hour to arrive, but when it did, it did not disappoint. I suppose items are made to order. Not really realistic, in my opinion - but I believe these are things that can be worked out as time goes on....but the owners need to make some immediate adjustments.

Restaurant name  Flippin' Good Burgers & Shakes
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
Perhaps this is colored by my expectations but all the hype about fresh ingredients and flavor had me expecting something on par with a shake shack or smashburger style.   Instead I received a bland tasting burger overwhelmed by lettuce too big for the bun, tasteless bacon and a greasy bun.  The meat was overcooked.  The lettuce and toppings were otherwise fresh.  Also I would avoid the flipping good fries.  They are just drowned in thousand island and topped with "grilled" onions. I don't know what grill they used but mine tasted raw.  I couldn't even eat more than a few bites.  Price and fresh veggie ingredients save this place from a single star.Flippin' good? More like Flippin' mediocre. I love Fremont East. I've been kickin' it there before it was even dubbed Fremont East. I have excitedly walked by, watch the place evolve, and smelled glorious smells coming from within... A recent trip downtown lead me to Flippin' Good Burgers when I was starving.FGB is a cross between McDonald's and Smashburger, but waaaay closer to the McD's side. It's fast food. It's no IN-N-Out, it's not even Carl's Jr worthy. Yes, it's cleaner than a McD's and the staff is definitely friendlier, but it's just not special.I ordered a classic cheeseburger and a side of fries. The burger was bland, overcooked, served in a big ass bun (really, it's mostly buns, hun) and came with the lettuce, onion, and tomato (which were all fresh and still crisp). The fries were fries. Again, nothing to write home about.The food is really two star worthy, but the clean, freshness, newness, reasonable prices, and friendliness of the staff allow me to tip the stars in the favor of FGB.What could be considered my LIB HQ, I had quite a few meals at Flippin' Good last weekend. My order was always a double turkey burger (extra pickles, mustard), a side of fries and a water. Total: $7.xx. I know you can find some cheap eats on Freemont, but anytime you can REALLY stuff yourself for under $8, I'm a fan. As for the food itself, it wasn't half bad. Like others have mentioned, it's a step above a McD's, but probably a step down from a BurgerFi or Smashburger. Much respect for having a potato bun, 'merican cheese, fresh veggies (which you can ask them to pile on) and a legit sized patty. The Flippin Sauce on the burg' is no Animal Style from I&O or Mac Sauce, but it's not the worst. Bottom line, when intoxicated or in need of a relatively quick and inexpensive meal, this place isn't a bad place to be. Coat that stomach and rage on! Note: it takes 7-10 minutes to get your order. Prepare for that.I would call Flippin Good Burgers Flippin Humdrum.  I found it to be little more than a middle of the road fast food joint with a nice dining room and trendy location.  The fare definitely did not wow.  In my opinion, In n Out's flavors are superior.  We got the Bacon Cheeseburger, Grilled Chicken Sandwich, Onion Rings, & Flippin Fries, with Huckleberry and Pumpkin Pie milkshakes.  The Cheeseburger and Chicken were bland & overly greasy on stale buns, and the onion rings were overcooked.  The shakes were cloyingly sweet and artificial tasting.Overall, we just did not enjoy the items we purchased at Flippin Good, but the space itself is very nice and clean for a fast food restaurant.We're touring around here in Vegas and we just got back from walking around at Hoover Dam and need us some food for lunch. Got the car parked at one of the casinos nearby so we wanted something walking distance. Getting out the yelp, I see this place Flippin' Good Burgers opened recently and is right down here in the middle of the Fremont Street Experience area. OK, good choice!This is a casual burger place, maybe a bit above full on fast food as the quality seems higher. The prices are not bad, but you have to consider the beef patties used are not the biggest either. Probably like a 1/4 lb I think. You put your order in and the food comes out on one of those red trays. You get to build your burger just the way you want. After pondering all the options, I went with the Farm Burger 2X on the patty please. ($6.70) It comes with a fried egg, smoked bacon, Ketchup and cheese. I had them add free grilled onions to mine. My BF got the Bacon Cheeseburger 2X patties. ($6.60) That one came with lettuce, tomato, cheese and bacon. He added the grilled onions as well. Then we ordered an order of the fries to share ($2.05) as well as a 16oz Strawberry shake ($4.25) to share. That's a pretty cheap lunch considering you are in the middle of tourist central Vegas!The food come out in a timely manner. We were luck to get a place to sit. I beat him to the first taste of the fries ....yes, fresh cooked and not frozen, like those crinkle cut things. Nice fries, yum lets add salt and dip in mayo and Ketchup mix! OK, my first bite into my egg burger (farm burger), Yes, good flavor, getting the cheese mix with the bacon and the egg is good, cooked yolk still all little runny .....hard cooked doesn't cut it on a burger. It's not dinky around like an In N Out either ...bigger. More like a Habit Burger ....Vegas has one now! My BF enjoys his burger and we share the shake. The shake is thick and seem more "real" than one of those fake shakes at Mc D's. I'd say all and all a good stop for food if you don't feel like doing the whole sit down and be served thing. No, these burgers won't rival a premium burger at a brew pub, but for fast casual, it hits the mark.Flippin' Good is a flippin' cheap option for Fremont Street eats- two can easily dine under $20, and that's with a side and dessert to share! I was excited about this spot opening but hesitant to visit given the generally-underwhelmed reviews, but their claims of freshness eventually tempted me through the door. BURGERS: The menu lists single- and double-burgers for each style, I opted for the classic and realized why. The patty thickness is somewhere between White Castle and Dollar Menu Double. Props for offering a lettuce-wrapped version. Beef version, like all the other reviews, lends itself to a less-favorable comparison to that West coast chain. The turkey burger retained a surprising juiciness and the toppings were fresh.FRIES: The regular variety are lightly salted, but if your a fan of spice, opt for the Flippin' Spicy style. I openly admit that these were WAY too spicy for me, with tons of chopped grilled jalapenos in every nook and cranny. These were perfectly topped too: so much cheese and pepper that it was difficult to find bare fries, even at the bottom. A win for most people, a lose for me, because it rendered the dish inedible, but this is entirely my fault.CONCRETE:  A few specialty versions for a sweet dessert treat, BF opted for the Brownie Delight, whose chocolaty tones were reminiscent of a Frosty, in a good way. The 10oz small is just the right size and the bits of brownie blended in added a nice texture that didn't take away from the overall creaminess.Service was quick and cheery, space is clean and welcoming with framed, mirrored windows on the walls lending a farm-house feeling. This is a nice addition to the area given their relatively low price point and the fact that they deliver on their promised freshness. But it's not the kind of meal I'll cross town for, nor one I can justify paying a parking fee to access due to the location. Outside of the downtown area, I'd probably be more inclined to give them another try.

Review Text :
I'm digging SoHo. As a resident of the Fitch, I am always excited to see a new restaurant open. Located in the former Cousins Subs, the food cart opened this fast casual restaurant. The menu is limited and is what I would consider Asian fusion. I opted for the chicken curry. Flavor wise, it was delicious. Not as sweet as a Thai curry. I would consider it a hybrid between Thai and Indian with a decent amount of spice. The only thing holding this back is the lack of protein. Ordered with chicken, it was big on flavor but light on yardbird. While the price point is relatively low ($8.50), I sill expected more. I will definitely return as it a perfect place for when you don't want to cook but you also don't want to waste an hour plus at a sit down restaurant.  Welcome to the neighborhood, SoHo!Working on the south side of Madison, I have access to a wealth of Asian food options, so I was curious to find out how SoHo Gourmet Cuisine was going to carve out a niche for itself in this crowded market. While the dumplings I sampled from the SoHo food cart this past summer failed to impress, my experience at their bricks and mortar facility was far more impressive.  When combined with passionate service and an inviting interior, the well prepared food at SoHo has my taste buds clamoring for a return visit.When I stepped into the restaurant, I barely recognized it from its previous incarnation as a Cousin's Sub Shop.  The open kitchen, with its gleaming stainless steel fixtures immediately caught my eye.  Two large flat screens located above the counter project the menu options to prospective patrons.  The matching black chairs and tables, together with the grey and cream floor tiles provided additional flair to the space.  A boom box on a table in the center of the restaurant provided some soothing background music during my meal.  While the dining area has a flat screen TV was mounted on the wall, it was not turned on during my visit.The focused lunch menu has three main categories: 1) Dumplings (chicken, beef and pork) 2) Rice plates (BBQ Pork, Curry and Charbroil Chicken) and 3) Salads (Lemon Balsamic, Sassy Peanut and Soy Citrus).  I elected to go with the daily special, the ginger - garlic fried rice with the $2 fried chicken skewer.  After about five minutes, I received a massive bowl of fried rice topped with a perfectly fried runny egg.  I savored the combination of the runny yolk with the fried rice - my only regret was that I wish there was more yolk.  The fried rice was well prepared - not only did the kitchen do a terrific job of balancing the ginger and garlic components, they served the homemade soy sauce on the side, so I could control the seasoning of my dish.The fried chicken stick was simply spectacular.  The crunchy, lightly battered exterior gave way to the succulent, well-seasoned interior.  It easily was the best $2 I spent that week.  Rocky, the passionate owner of SoHo, personally checked in with all the patrons during the busy lunch service.  He quickly established a rapport with all the customers, whether they were newbies like myself, or repeat customers to the restaurant.Based on this sensational experience, I can't wait to return.  The combination of speedy, enthusiastic service with flavor-packed Asian-influenced fare makes SoHo Gourmet Food a welcome addition to my South Madison lunch circuit.

Dear Lord this place is good. Like really good. Like I want this in my life every day good. It's a simple menu of only a handful of choices, but I have no doubt every single item is delicious.This is because my pork sandwich, with apple jam and a perfectly crisped kale chip on top was pure heaven. The side dish of green beans, ricotta, apple jam and egg was the perfect pairing. To top this off, I had the most delicious vanilla lemonade. One thing I will note is that this does not come cheap. The total was $22. Honestly, it was totally worth it. But if you're looking for a cheap lunch, this is not your place.The decor is GORGEOUS too. It looks like that home decor magazine you subscribe to and want for your own. Exposed brick, herringbone hardwood floors, marble tables and exposed beams. That's it. I gotta go once a week to feed my craving!There's "toast," and then there's TOAST.  Vandal's "Toasts" fall into the latter category. I arrived at The Vandal one sunny Sunday Lville morning with a crew of 6. We were seated right away and ordered from the counter after perusing the [small] menu. I chose the Huckleberry Toast while Aimee D. chose the Squash Toast so we could share.  Among the groups' other choices were the Morning Burger, a Bacon Plate and Celery Soup.  We all left pleased, but maybe just a tad bit hungry. The Toasts are INCREDIBLE, but at the end of the day, it's one [big] piece of toast. So, if you're looking for more, I'd recommend adding the yogurt/granola for some delicious protein. We were each given a sample of this concoction and DAMN, was it good.  But back to the toasts - the ingredients on top were clearly top notch. At $6, each Toast isn't going to break the bank, but $12 for two, which I definitely could've housed, is a bit too much for me for...toast. Something to think about. I recommend going with a bunch of friends and completely "vandalizing" the menu - meaning, order one of everything and have at it. Welcome to Lawrenceville, Vandal!Parking in Lawrenceville is nearly impossible except on Sundays when it is free! I  pulled in to a small lot near this place and when I went to register the car I noted the free parking.So I walked in, the place is small but packed with people but I managed to find a table. The menu is on a chalkboard above the counter, you place your order and  they bring it out to you. Since today was Sunday brunch I saw that the special was a plate of bacon or ham with fried eggs, kale salad, and toast for $11.00. I saw one of them and thought too much fat on the bacon or it was burnt on another order so I decided to opt for something else.I asked the counter manager his recommendation since this was my first time here. He said that I would enjoy the "squash toast". It is toast topped with caramelized onions and kale. I also ordered the yogurt and granola parfait to go with it. For a drink he recommended the lavender lemonade. So I went with that. Most everything else here is ala carte but I got away with $16.00 for my selections.I paid for my breakfast and sat down. At each table they have tap water in a closed bottle. I received my meal fairly quick and the same man who took my order helped me out. I noticed that although I loved the toast it was a bit hard to cut with a knife. He took it back and had it cut for me. I asked him what type of bread they use for their toast. I was told they use sourdough bread from 5 points  which is some bakery over on Wilkins Ave in Squirrel Hill.The food was very good and I got to chat with a couple at the next table. He was having a fried doughnut with a creme filling before the main course. He said that he often comes here for lunch and recommends I try the fried chicken sandwich. Sounds like a plan to me!I noticed that they have take out and by the time I was finished this place was packed with people waiting for tables. My advice would be to get here early since this must be a popular place. When I left I took note of other businesses I thought interesting so it will definitely mean a return trip.Eat like a vandal! The food is ravenously good!As other have written, this is a nice space.  The staff stopped by a couple of times to see how we were doing and if everything was good.  It was!My burger with tomato mayo and pickles was tasty.  Loved the pickles and burger.  Some of the tomato mayo dripped on my fries, Oh so good.  Just like in Europe with some mayo on you fries!  Should have asked for a little to dip my fries into.  The mayo probably could have a tad more tomato for flavor. The lavender tea was tasty.Surprised they did not have WiFi.

Well most of these reviews are about the staff, my review is about the food. This is a new restaurant in Queen Creek people, you are going to wait AT LEAST an hour for a table and staff is going to be on the fritz for a little until they get their groove down. This happens every time a new place opens up out here, so we decided to get it to go, smarter choice so we thought. I ordered lunch about 12:15 figuring it would be a while for them to make it, so our pick up time was 1:15 (an hour for a to go order, ouch). When we picked up our food at 1:10, nothing was hot, you could tell it was made a while ago and was just sitting out waiting for us to pick up, if you are going to tell us a prompt pick up time, don't let the food sit out forever. We already waited in line to get our to go order, I wasn't going to send the food back. Got it home, yep, ice cold!I got the pesto pasta, my boyfriend got the regular spaghetti with sausage, my sister got a pizza and my son got a slice of pizza. After we all re-heated our food, we finally got to eat. Unfortunately I only took about 3 bites of my food and I threw it away. The cheese was hard (even after I warmed it up) because it had been sitting out at the restaurant too long so it made the pasta really dry, there was hardly any sauce which made it taste really bland and I couldn't eat any of the bread bowl it came in because it was rock hard and stale. My boyfriends spaghetti was ok, nothing special about it, the sausage was nice and spicy so that was good. My sisters pizza was also tasteless (you're a pizza place, how does a pepperoni pizza not taste good!?) Then last my sons cheeses pizza, cold and hard as a rock. Luckily he's 5 so pizza is pizza, he was the only one who ate all their food. Oregano's I know you just opened and things are rough at the beginning, having poor staff is one thing, but serving awful food....... come on!? A waste of $50 on family dinner, ended up having to cook something because everyone was still hungry.

We fell in love with this place. It's located inside Venetian hotel canal shoppes. You really feel like you are in Europe. The restaurants have that exact lighting that they use in Europe.The pastries look shiny, colorful & glazed & most importantly they are DELICIOUS. We ordered the berry tart, berry waffle, almond pastry. Also the latte & cappuccino were perfect.  The berry waffle was swirled with chocolate & had a very yummy homemade wipe cream on it. It tasted really perfect.Then we ordered the mozzarella sandwich, it was Devine!!! I think I died went to heaven & came back with every bite. I highly recommend this Restuarant. I wish they would open one near us in Palis Verdes. We don't have a great French bakery/Restuarant near us.

Review Text :
We heard this is a new hot pot restaurant and we decided to try it out today. We arrived there 5:30pm and it was a little busy. The food is fresh, and there are lots of selections of vegetables and seafood. However, they have a HORRIBLE service. After a while, my water glass was empty, and I asked for refills. The server refilled my drink, but after that, he just disappeared! After an hour and half, my water is empty again. I desperately needed my water to be refilled. The soup base was empty too. Nobody showed up for the whole hour!!!We didn't even have a chance to ask for water and soup!!!! After eating, we waited another half an hour to see if the server would show up and give us the bill. Well, nobody showed up. We went to the cashier, and the cashier wanted us to go back so that he know which table we were at. I complained to the manager. Guess what the manager said? "I'm sorry. We just opened the business, and our employees have no ideas about their serving sections." Seriously? Are you being sincere at all? This is how you deal with a customer who complains to you? Well, if you are in restaurant business, you should have known how to provide quality service to your customers and train your servers properly so that they know which sections they are responsible for! Guess what? When we were paying the bill, the sever who served us was standing next to us and getting bills for other tables. He saw us and he totally ignored us!!! One ironic thing is the restaurant is located by UNLV and they surely hire Hotel College students. So the manager just hire those kids who learned nothing about service and hospitality? Well, I have given the opportunity to manager, but he refused to make more money from me and my friends. I'm going to let my friends know how bad the service is here. We're NEVER gonna come back.Summary:The reason for the one star rating is because of the great service (sarcasm to a certain extent). The place was empty on a Wednesday night so all the servers were very attentive to our table of 4. Now the following reasons are why it is missing the other 4 stars. The following sections well depicts my horrid experience and spoiler alert, food poisoning.Price:35 per person equates to roughly about 45 per person after tax and tips. I have been in town for long enough to know that the usual price for a similar all you can eat dinner is 25-30 at most unless the store is established in a hotel on the strip. But the Caesars Palace Bacchanal Buffet is only 50-60 before tax per person depending on the day of the weak. They are established in a school area which also equates to students that will not be able to shell out 35 for a dinner. Yes, their target demographic might be rich second generation kids (guessing from the decor, which in detail is also shit) but then why is the place so big? ADDITIONALLY, they charge for soda, 3 dollars a cup but with unlimited refills. Therefore, I believe the solution to the problem is to eliminate soda charges and not offer the crab since it was not fresh anyways and lower the RIDICULOUS price. The total for our party of 4 people total was 195 after tax and tip, ridiculous. Taste:4/4 in our party had diarrhea following the dinner. We ordered a half and half pot. Both broth were refilled with non spicy broth which made the spicy side un-spicy. Meat were average, great selection of vegetable, seafood was not fresh and bad. Pot Tea, Yojie, and many other places are much more delicious taste wise. Atmosphere:Walking in was very awkward since no one greets you and you face the bar area. Right side is the restroom which when I was there, it had a broken handicap stall door. Lighting is good, music fits in pretty well. Then walking forward, you can see the wall of meat and seafood to one side and vegetable on the other. The worst part about the whole buffet area is the sauce area, way too crowded and the spoon are way to small to fill the sauce bowls. So a lot of people are there trying to decide on sauce then uses additional time for using the small spoons. The soda machine is next to the seafood area, again 3 dollars after the ridiculous 35 dollars. Great. (sarcasm)Service:We heard about this store over WeChat advertisement and word of mouth before it even opened, it was greatly hyped and they had full seating and that made service horrible since the place is so big (oversized in my opinion). Then when people tried once and hated it, business died down to now or when we went there (close to now). Therefore there is a lack of business for the size of the place (as I stated before). This also equates to overstaff which is good and bad, it is awkward at times (people watching you eat) but then the good is that there is instant service. The 35 just makes me not want to tip, seriously.Final Words:I do not want to seem cheap to anyone, I drive a Porsche Cayenne Turbo. But seriously, the pricing is very unjust. The food does not justify the price. The atmosphere nor the service either. Our party of four all left with food poisoning. What motivated me to write this is, we paid a premium for food poisoning and a so-so experience? Right. Decor: 3/5Service: 3.5/5Price: 1/5Taste: 2/5Quality of Food: 1/5 (Food Poisoning)Portion: 5/5I came to visit from California and my friends suggested trying this place because it had just opened up next to their school. Went in on a rather slow night, and I figured it was because it was a week day since the place was almost completely empty. After we got seated, we saw that it was all you can eat, $35. We were a bit hesitant at first because ayce places usually ranges from around $20~25, but we didn't think it would be too bad because hey, usually quality makes paying a little extra worth it. Boy was I wrong! They have a large variety to choose from- seafood, meats, vegetables. Almost everything you could ask for for hot pot, so that was a huge plus. We grabbed everything we wanted, but getting sauces took a lot longer than necessary. They only have one bar, and the spoon you use to scoop the sauces are about the size of a teaspoon. So everyone is just lined up, one by one with your average rude purple who would come shoving in here and there to try to get at least 10 scoops of a sauce along with other scoops for added flavor. Once we got everything we wanted, we went to our table with our pot (flavors: regular mushroom broth/mild spicy broth). The broth was rather bland and almost tasteless. Even the spicy broth wasn't all that spicy and just got less spicy the more we ate and as the servers would gradually refill our pots. Which is a disappointment especially since the broth is what usually leaves an impression for hot pot. The seafood  wasn't really fresh, but the lamb and beef made up for it. We left the place feeling very disappointed and unsatisfied. Our bill came out to almost $200 (gratuity + tax included) for 4 people. The only good thing I could say about this place is that the decor was beautiful, and the service was very attentive, yet again- there were only like 3 tables to tend to. I don't think I'll be coming back at all. We always have an appetite for hot pot, but this place was ridiculously expensive and was definitely not worth the price at all. I go to regular hot pot places that are not ayce and the price doesn't even sum up to here. Even $10 ayce hot pot places are a lot better and more flavorful.**update: we all got food poisoning. Definitely never coming back.3 dollars for fountain soda? 35 dollars per person for frozen meat and average seafood?One of the waiters (Probably new) just kind of stood and watched us eat and had to be told when to refill our drinks and take our dirty plates.I'm torn about this place. On one hand the food was good, price was fair ($28 with 20% promotion), and service was super attentive. Pick a broth, take the food buffet style, and cook it in the pot at your table. This place doesn't have ponzu sauce but I made it myself using soy sauce, ice water, and lemons. There's seafood, meats, vegetables, and fresh fruits for desserts. On the other hand, I was rushed to the ER and hospitalized overnight for a severe reaction to their bad blue crab (photo attached). Upon telling them this they were indifferent.I wouldn't eat here again because I like breathing.

i was lucky enough to be invited to the soft opening at FOGO!throughout my whole experience, we received the greatest service from the FOGO staff. morgan recommended the best meats and knew her pairings with the sauces. my favorite was the chimichurri and the hot sauce. the meats were non stop and everything was delicious. i loved their PICANHA steak and couldn't stop eating it. it was seasoned so well and i love how it was thinly sliced with a bit of fat on the side. i couldn't stop asking for more. my card was always on the GREEN GO side. the market table provided a variety of veggies, cheeses, deli meats, salmon, rice, and many more! i like how you can keep going back for more. the server was saying that fogo is an all you can experience. my favorite was the fresh mozzarella cheese, quinoa kale salad, prosciutto, and baby corn. the brazilian cheese bread was the BEST part of them all. i couldn't stop eating them! very addicting. fogo also provides caramelized bananas to help cleanse your tasting palette. i thought it was very accommodating and a good idea. the service is top notch at fogo. my party and i felt so welcomed by the friendly staff. our drinks were constantly refilled and our plates were always changed. the staff also had this tool to clean the crumbs off the table and thought it was great! the restaurant is super clean and very modernized. i would definitely recommend this restaurant for a date night or a special occasion. i can't wait to come back for more!I feel like Jim Carrey's character from the movie "Yes Man" whenever I am at a churrascaria...totally incapable of saying no to anything!   Caipirinhas? Yes, and please keep them coming.  Bottom sirloin?  Heck yes!  I'll take 3 slices.  Lamb chops?  OH FUCK YES!!  Leave the whole freakin thing on the table!!!  No....control.....whatsoever.  If a shady looking dude wearing a hat and a musty  overcoat offered candy corn straight from the palm of his slightly dirty hand, I would say yes and assume it was a limited time promotion.  Fogo de Chao vs Texas de Brazil:  It's a high scoring draw. Sure, there a few items the other one doesn't have, and certain meats may be slightly better at one over the other, but everyone ends up a winner in this fight no matter which you choose.

I don't know that I've ever left a bad review. I think it's bad karma. That said, this experience warrants a warning to others. The food was terrible. Not just your run of the mill, not what I expected so I'm dissatisfied bad, but legit bad. On a Saturday afternoon, they were out of chicken wings. The garlic knots they provided as an apology were spackled with that crappy jarred minced garlic that stays in your throat for weeks and tasted like Pirates of the Caribbean smells. And the pizza. It was the same pizza they sell at the Mini Gran Prix because kids don't know the difference, but this pizza was 4x the price. The crust had that mildewy taste, the sauce was about on par with undoctored canned tomato sauce and it was DRIPPING with grease, which is usually a sign of good pizza. Not so here. Coming from an Italian family, I am programmed not to leave food uneaten, but I made an exception this time. The New York headquarters of this brand should shut this location down immediately or risk sullying the name on the West Coast.TLDR: Strip prices without a Strip location. Pizza itself has fairly good flavor, just don't order with mushrooms or take it to go. If you're paying for the view, you might as well enjoy it.Came in after a run around the lake, happy to see they have a two-slice lunch special- unfortunately, they want $6/slice, which is on par with Secret Pizza's pricing. Adding on a single topping will run you a buck a slice. $14 for two pepperoni slices and a drink?! For a couple bucks more, you can get an entire 12" specialty pie (tax + tip will make it ~$20). What Shark Tank reject did the valuation and menu pricing?!Opted for the featured Don Michele Meat Pizza (pepperoni, Italian sausage, smoked bacon, and onions), subbed mushrooms for the onions. Flavor was below average: they use canned mushrooms (which isn't in line with their premium prices), they forgot the bacon listed in the ingredients, and the pizza was under cooked in the middle. Crust itself was okay- chewy not crispy, decent sauce.

I started off a loyal customer, but I've had too many bad experiences here to continue supporting this location.They certainly started off strong and staff was very attentive when they first opened, but I've noticed a very steep decline in service, especially with the attitudes of the staff and quality of food. Half the pizzas I was ordering started to come out burnt and the overall flavor just wasn't as good. Last visit, when I went up to order a pizza with their traditional crust, I asked for alfredo sauce as the base sauce. The worker instead proceed to make me their Alfredo's Alfredo pizza. I stopped before she could put on more toppings and she gave me a ton of attitude and explained that this was all the things that came with my order. I let her know I only replied "alfredo please" when she asked me my sauce choice. She begrudgingly started a new pizza for me and gave me lackluster service the whole time. I constantly had to ask if she could include more of the toppings I asked for, when she couldn't even look me directly in the eye. I get people have bad days in the food service industry, I had plenty myself when I worked at Mrs. Fields, Panda Express and Hot Dog on a Stick. No matter how mad you are or how bad your day is, there is a minimum standard of service someone should bring to the table even during those times. My husband wanted to continue to patron this place, until he got screwed over on his order, so he then agreed, no more Pieology for us. Same worker above made his BBQ chicken pizza - we take it home, and no BBQ sauce put on after it was cooking. He was mad lol, but serves him right for making us go here one more time despite my protests. Side Note: there's a Bill Cosby quote on the wall, they should probably consider taking that down.Pro Tip: Go to The Pizza Kitchen on Fort Apache instead. Plentiful toppings and better quality ingredients.Ate salad for dinner!  Mostly croutons and tomatoes.  Really just one big round crouton covered with tomato sauce.  And cheese.  Fine, it was pizza.  I ate pizza.Since we made plans to hit the gym after dinner, I figured I'd help motivate myself and give myself a goal of burning off like 1,000 calories.  Genius, right [obviously joking but no seriously, I ate that pizza and then punished myself at the gym]?  I got myself half Alfredo's Alfredo and half Mad to Meat You.  I got artichoke hearts and black olives added for some more veggies.  I also got to pick at someone else's half Smokin' Buffalo Chicken and half Rustic Veggie pizza.  Both pizzas had a super generous amount of toppings.  Like I was seriously impressed.  One of the younger ladies tonight carefully placed all my toppings with care as well.  I was surprised since the other two make-your-own pizza places normally just toss everything on haphazardly so I appreciate the attention she gave it.  It ensured for a balanced bite every time.  After everything was topped onto my pie, they asked to make sure I was happy and it was great.  Wonderful service, seriously.  As for the crust, the crust is baked to be super crispy.  There was no way that crust was going to bend.  All in all, I was extremely pleased with Pieology!This Pieology Pizzeria location just recently opened so everything is nice and clean.  Throughout the whole time we sat there, we had multiple people check in on us to make sure everything was satisfying.  Seriously great service!Hey I really dig these make-it-to-order pizza joints.  I stopped in today and ordered the classic margherita plus artichokes.  The employees greet people right away, and I like the clean, sunny room.  Initially they seemed to be a little disorganized on keeping track of whose pizza was where in the oven, but that should work itself out in time.  They tried to give me Ed's pizza, and Ed's pizza looked pretty good, full of meat, mushrooms, and olives, but I'm not Ed.  I took my pie home to scarf in private and really enjoyed the flavors.  The garlicky olive oil is very nice and fresh tomatoes and basil make for a perfect mix of flavors.  I just think the grape tomatoes might not be the best idea.  They fall off easily.  Some sliced romas might work out better.The crust was crisp and buttery, just like I like it.  Overall this is a great addition to all the restaurants by the mall.  And the price...can't beat the price...$7.95 plus tax equals a pizza for $8.57, and I only ate half of it, I swear!

Restaurant name  Sushi Takashi

Review Text :
Sushi Takashi is located in the former short lived Hiromaru ramen joint. But, they have changed the interior completely, with dark sexy colors and wood, cool booths, and a wide sushi bar. After taking a seat at the bar, I met the man himself, Chef Takashi, who is a friendly and cool person. While they do have an a la carte menu, I was more interested in the shiny, laminated menu that had some more unique options. On one side contained a 10 course and 12 course menu. And on the other side, a combo menu with a whole lot of options including a bottomless one, a roll one, a never ending salmon bowl, and a quick to-go bento. They also have an $80 ayce option. I decided to go with the 12 course.This was interesting because it wasn't like a traditional kaiseki, where the portions are super small. The value at Takashi's is better than most of the izakayas in the valley. And what else is interesting is that you modify the options on the course menu as you see fit.Before the courses began, they brought out some mini Japanese crackers to snack on. They were good.The first course was the the garlic edamame. The spices were really good and bright. And the edamame had a vibrant color.The next course was the tuna carpaccio. The fish quality was excellent and it went well with soy dressing that had yuzu in it.Next came the salad. I think that I made a great combo with the soba noodle and salmon skin options. The noodles were perfectly cooked and the salmon skin had a great texture to them. I enjoyed the tanginess of the mayo dressing that they used to bring everything together.The meat dish came out next. I ordered the beef teriyaki. This was a simplified version of grilled beef that was seasoned lightly. The beef was of very good quality, and was cooked to a spot-on medium rare. The sauce was kept on the light side, and helped amplify the taste of the beef, rather than mask it as some other spots tend to do.The chef also gave me a taste of the king crab that was available. You don't normally see this item in most sushi restaurants, and I appreciated that fact.The next course was the roll course, in which you can choose from the menu any one of specialty rolls on the menu. I chose the King club roll, which is their king crab made into a roll with avocado. What I noticed immediately was that their rice is cooked perfectly, not too hard or soft, and I personally don't like a too strong of a vinegar taste, and I liked that Takashi's was more neutral-sweet, because that gives it more of a natural taste to the rice. Seriously, king crab and avocado? Now that's what i'm talking about!Next course was the chicken, and I chose the karage. I liked the fact that the chicken were PIPING HOT!! A lot of sushi restaurants in Vegas can learn a thing or two from Takashi about making their karage more hot.Next the seafood course came, and I picked the oysters. Six large oysters were brought out in this Asian mignonette style sauce. They were fresh and sweet. I literally could have eaten about 50 of these. They were amazing. Next, the sukiyaki came out. It came with a generous amount of beef, and it was fun eating it with the noodles, onions, and scallions. The baked dish was next so what looked like a dynamite baked roll came out and was very tasty as well.My nigiri dish came out afterwards and I can say that I am impressed with the high quality of the fish they are using here. It's higher than Goyemon's and more like Yummy Grill's on Lake Mead (Not Eastern ave!!). The rice was perfect and everything just went really well together.The soup course then came. I ordered the creamy white stew. Looking back, I would have probably chosen the miso. I liked the earthiness of the stew, but it wasn't really my cup of tea.Chef Takashi wanted me to try their tuna belly before my last course as a gesture of their grand opening. Once again, they are using high quality fish, and they are thick slices. Mikey likes it!My last course came out which was the dessert course. I ordered the tempura ice cream. The ice cream was exquisite, and the batter was very neutral tasting, which highlighted the ice cream.Throughout the evening, what I realized was that I never felt rushed throughout the evening. The service was awesome, even though it's a brand new restaurant. It has actually been a really long time since I've felt just really comfortable eating at a sushi restaurant. My impression was that I was eating at a Strip high-end sushi restaurant, without having to pay those overpriced, exorbitant prices that those restaurants on the Strip usually command. Even though they have just opened, if they are able to maintain the quality, this would be one of my favorite sushi restaurants in Las Vegas. Great value, great quality, great service, great ambiance, that's all you can really ask for. I'm kinda over the AYCE thing, so i'm looking for a bit more, and Sushi Takashi delivers!The truckload of food that Takashi pushes out for his $40 twelve course dinners make Restaurant Week look like Restaurant Weak.  Seriously... you would need to attach a garbage disposal to your stomach to make it through this bad boy.  Maybe if my car broke down up on Mount Charleston and I walked all the way here would it be possible?  So while value, ambition, friendly service, and remarkable design upgrades cannot be denied, my fault is with the execution and general flow of the menu.  Even for myself, I find it hard to believe I am complaining about too much food, but I am going there.   As an example, course plate #4-#8 could easily go chicken teriyaki, huge sushi roll, 6 oysters, karaage (fried chicken) and then beef sukiyaki.  That's like a mixtape going from Mozart to Slipknot to Whitney Houston to last year's Grammy winning polka artist.  Why are oysters right in the dead center of the 12?  Who goes from fried meat to sukiyaki in real life?  Something like this should be harmonious from beginning to end, but I just looked at it as battles within battles.  The menu vs my stomach capacity, the food vs the ever-growing takeout bag the servers kept loading up, my waistline vs my pants, my tastebuds' sanity vs "holy shit, we're only on #5??"  A server informed us that only one person had been able to plow through it all since they opened and that "He was a Yelper".  Nice job, Yelper.  Did you go to Home Depot or Lowe's for that attachment? ;)If you're still going to do this, these are the battles between course choices:#3: Soba Salad vs Tofu Salad vs Potato Salad: My wife's Soba Salad won.  The dressing mixed with the cold noodles and crisp greens were excellent.  You also get a choice of salad topping (grilled salmon, chicken or salmon skin).  We both went with grilled salmon although perhaps the salmon skin might have come off like a luxurious crouton and been the way to go.  Don't load up on potato!  Trust me.  #6: Oysters vs Snow Crab: It was a TKO by the oysters.   Even though the crab was nicely presented on a chilled plate, it could never be a match of 6 large raw oysters on a wooden boat.  This would retail for at least $18 elsewhere.  I will be back for this the next time dining a la carte.   #7: Tempura vs Karaage: We barely touched either of these due to fullness and what was still to come, but I'd go with the tempura which was a nice medley of veggies along with 2 pieces of shrimp.  Even though the karaage was dry and uninspiring, it lasted better in the fridge whereas tempura should be eaten immediately and was really bad a couple of days later.  Already stuffed to the gills, it was at this point that we considered asking to return tomorrow to finish the rest.  Would it be OK if I just left my credit card overnight?  I saw that there was a foot spa in the same plaza.  Maybe we could come back in an hour?  That moment sounded as good a time as any to take up cigarette smoking.  #8: Beef Sukiyaki vs Diced Steak:  Bitch, please.  Not only did the steak not put up a fight, they didn't even walk into the ring.  Flawless victory!  The sukiyaki was classic.  It was rich and filled with noodles, vegetables and semi-fatty beef which made the broth even better.  We asked for a side of raw egg to dip the beef into, and that made those 6 combined bites we took before they whisked it away in takeout boxes even better.  This could have been a standalone entrée.  #9: Mini Doria vs 4 pc Baked Fantasy:  They should get rid of this course altogether.  The doria is a bowl of rice topped with a mix of ground beef, tomato sauce and cream.  No one in their right mind would want this after everything else.  Ditto for a gross hot sushi roll filled with cream cheese.  Lose, lose.  Server: "Anything else?"Me: "Lap band surgery."#10: 4 piece nigiri vs Salmon Bowl (more rice!) vs Hamburger:  Nigiri won.  It was the smallest portion of food!  Tony T was at another table and got the hamburger which was a FULL HAMBURGER, BUN AND ALL WITH FRIES.  Am I going crazy?  Some may avoid this spot because their AYCE is $80 per person, but with the exorbitant amount of food we walked out with, it'll be more about all you can't eat.  There were 5 more individual meals with the leftovers we had!  Portions should be halved, if not quartered, and everything needs to be rearranged by someone with sane eyes.   No one would complain about paying $40 for that.I didn't partake of the 10- or 12-course meal of insanity, but there's really no way around it: no matter what you get here, you WILL eat a monstrous amount of food. I appreciate that they offer several specials as well as typical a la carte options, and the menu itself is extensive, with several apps, a giant page of rolls, and everything in between.CHICKEN KARAGE: So crispy, so juicy! I love Japanese fried chicken, and the version put out here is done just right.SALMON SKIN SALAD: Holy giant portions, Batman! This salad alone could easily be a lunch, packed with fish (not just skin), fruit, and an ample amount of fresh veggies in a light, flavorful dressing. Nice variety of textures, too.3 ROLL COMBO: This option allows you to pick three special rolls, and get bottomless miso soup, house salad, and dessert (various ice creams) for a crazy-low $26, which is easily enough food for two people but at a cost that rivals the AYCE pricing elsewhere. The miso was standard but the house salad was the first I've come across in an Asian restaurant that included avocado! Add some of the chicken from your karage app and this could easily be a "safe" meal for a kid or picky eater. Opted for the Nagasaki (great cilantro sauce!), the Orange Lemon (citrus + seafood = love), and the Sapporo (just enough spice) and found them all unique and tasty, with fresh fish, minimal rice, and tasty (but not overpowering) sauces. The food was so tasty that we kept ordering and my stomach staged a revolt after the onslaught of food. But in a good way. Pricing is very fair: even a sashimi appetizer plate for two (~10 pieces) is an extremely reasonable $15. I'll definitely be coming back- in addition to the amazing food, the service is on point (ask for Jeffrey!), and the interior is a fun mix of classy and rustic. NOTE: You can buy a $12 shirt and get 10% off on future visits when you wear it! I haven't done that yet, but if we come back often enough, I might just have to.Yummy in my tummy when in Vegaaaaa!Their seating booth area is shaped as half wine barrels - pretty neat!  Service was attentive and nice!Food for happy hours was happening!  I love their salmon sashimi carpaccio.  The vinegar sauce with the smooth textured salmon, was delicious.  Do order up.  Also, the sprinkled salt asparagus, was swell and crisp to my liking.  Eat it if you need some veggie in your dietary system. They have a lot of variety on their menu to choose from.  I like the raw oysters.  It was refreshing for the hot weather Vegas - if you go during the summer heat.Bathrooms were a change of theme.  Instead of a standard or Japanese styled themed restroom, it was French themed with classical music played in the background.  Interesting. I got my sashimi sushi game on here and enjoyed the restaurant entirely.With all the AYCE sushi places in town, how could Takashi compete? Well, for one, you get seated right away and they have great selections to choose from...for a price. I know people out there who love to give bad reviews because a place is "expensive" - stay away!Depending on what you're interested in (cooked entrees, sushi, everything), there's a set for you. For the average AYCE sushi goers, I'd recommend the Takashi's Bottomless Dinner for $23 which includes salad, carpaccio or sashimi, miso soup, cooked entree and a roll. They also have 10-course dinner set and a 12-course dinner set.But what I always come here for is the Salmon Overflow Bowl. For $30 you get salad, miso soup and lots of salmon sashimi (there's rice underneath all the salmon). If you're a big fan of salmon like I am, this is worth it. I normally get seconds because it is a lot of salmon. They have different rolls and nigiri and other items you can order ala carte. The fish is always fresh and the cuts are good.

Review Text :
For now this is a temporary review of a guest tasting:Slated to open on 9/16/15 under the same Clique banner that brought Hearthstone Kitchen and Cellar to the Red Rock Hotel and Casino, Salute Trattoria Italiana by Luciano Sautto promises to do the same for regional Italian cuisine as its sibling did for upscale Americana, an early al fresco preview showing the same passion for ingredient sourcing while creativity and craftsmanship far outstrip anything the Western Suburbs has yet to know.Occupying the space across from Mercadito, managing partner Brian Massie and Maitre D' Enrico Sautto plus Hearthstone GM Peter Varela present throughout our meal, the space harboring Salute is long and shotgun straight with a Television-clad bar juxtaposing the outdoor patio, a beautifully tiled kitchen to the right while Antipasti and desserts are featured prominently behind glass closer to the Casino's core.Smartly sourcing the skills of an accomplished Italian Chef, while additionally spending a significant amount of time researching authentic recipes throughout Rome and the Amalfi Coast on a trip earlier this calendar year, the menu at Salute features six sections spread across two pages, the extensive selection of antipasti alongside crudo and salads while sides join pastas and entrees in numbers trumping ten.Indulgent in bread service, the costini served with antipasti toasted golden crisp while warm rosemary Focaccia upped the ante with good olive oil and old balsamic, course two featured one of three crudo and taking the road less traveled in presenting chopped Yellowtail glistening in an "Italian-Style" ponzu each bite was every bit as balanced as those seen at Hearthstone, the essence of fennel riding high on the palate while pinenuts added both texture and a mellow finishing note.Offered as an appetizer as opposed to the traditional wedge of oily parm, Sautto's take on roasted eggplant beneath fresh fior di latte was another opening stunner, and although a touch less crispy that some might have liked the sauce of little more than pure San Marzanos straight from his family restaurant overseas was the very essence of freshness, certainly not the sugared up iteration so frequently offered in America and meant to pass as "Italian" fare.Enjoying the spirit of good food, good friends, and good wine as the kitchen switched gears to the menu's right half, it was here that Enrico presented a pizza perfected through years of practice and although not currently planned for the restaurant suffice it to say that the results were absolutely fantastic, the same to be said of a fanciful table-side presentation of Salute's signature Fettuccini alla Vodka just a few minutes later, the booze lit afire within a wheel of cheese with sauced al dente pasta soon added, the results setting a new standard for taste as well as showmanship, a dish bound to gather eyes from onlookers and then to sell itself.Rounding out the savories with a salt crusted fish whose bargain basement price seems almost impossible considering the quality of the moist and meaty flesh, it was alongside lightly roasted spaghetti squash simply dressed in crushed tomatoes and Pecorino that a sampling of the sides was offered, the quality of ingredients left to show for themselves.Always excited for desserts, particularly given Chef Sautto and Massie's obvious desire to introduce and expand on the flavors seen during their respective times in Rome, the Tiramisu at Salute presents light and cloud-like without all the cloying sweetness or booze that fall so many others while Coconut Cake and a Flourless Chocolate Torte each speak to the work of a skilled baker, the gelatos and sorbets both here and served on freshly made cones on par with any restaurant in the Valley - the Stracciatella and Coconut particularly quite refined.I have eaten at Salute twice--once before the restaurant was open in a private dinner for 6 people and on opening night when seven of us gathered to try a number of dishes.  Items ordered:Pizza acquaAranciniAumm Aumm pastaTruffle tagliatelleLinguini with zucchini flowersLinguini vongoleSpaghetti carbonaraGnocchiPappardelle BologneseBaked rigatoniCrespelli CannelloniLasagnaSciué SciuéSpaghetti and meatballsSignature pastaChicken parmesanLemon chickenSide of broccoliniZucchini flowersBomboloniToasted coconut cakeFlourless chocolate torteThere are some winners in the pasta heavy dishes we tried.  The Signature pasta, done table side with flaming vodka in a wheel of parmigiano reggiano to melt some of the cheese and then having the vodka sauced pasta finished in the melted cheese wheel with some fresh basil leaves pulled off a plant and mixed in the pasta.  The flavors are very good and it's one of those fun dishes to watch being created at your table.The lasagna is a must try dish.  It's layered spinach pasta filled with tomato béchamel sauce and bolognese gravy.  The béchamel-cheese in the layers is creamy goodness.The gnocchi, pappardelle Bolognese, and spaghetti carbonara are good choices.Dishes to avoid:  Zucchini flowers, baked rigatoni, spaghetti and meatballs, and the arancini.This was opening night but the room was a veritable zoo that night.  The service was all over the place.  Our server was very good but his bussers just weren't up to the job.  There were times that there were main dishes to serve and there were no share plates for the table.  Our server tried to rectify this only to have some of the workers ignore the problem at hand.  You can;'t chalk this up to opening night jitters.  There had been a couple of soft opening nights prior to this one when many of these issues should have been addressed and solved.I'll be back, but they need time to sort out what's right and wrong with the service and to make some corrections to the food, specifically the meatballs and some other items.  Salute has a lot of promise but they'll need to make some changes to deliver a good product with good service.Owned by the suddenly swelling "Clique" group, whose Hearthstone has become an across-the-street go-to for a great meal from a kitchen staff I trust, it was after several back-and-forths with PR that myself and a few friends sat down on the patio of Salute just prior to its opening - the service expectedly exemplary straight from the hands of Chefs Sautto and Massie while food proved both bold and well-crafted enough to book an opening-night visit with friends as well as family...or at least so it seemed.No doubt a beautiful space, the interior long and shotgun straight with the left wall running bar to tiled kitchen to antipasti station as art and tiles decorate the walls, it was after a warm welcome at the podium that our party of seven was led to a large central table, greetings offered by everyone from GM Peter to Maitre 'd Enrico and Chef Luciano, the service from a friend an additional treat though Chef Massie apparently could not leave the pass or even be bothered to turn around.Acknowledging opening night jitters, the majority a fault of completely lost back-servers and a bar that couldn't seem to keep up with a quarter-capacity crowd, it was after a short discussion with Chef Luciano that the kitchen was given carte blanche with a focus on pastas, 32 of the restaurants offerings sampled over the course of this meal plus a next-day "Invite Only" with results running the gamut from exquisite to decidedly mediocre with price-to-portion ratios a bit skewed to the left.Already altering both the offerings and the costs from what was featured during the pre-opening taste, suffice it to say that some interesting items such as Osso Bucco Ravioli were axed in favor of far too many dishes centered on simple tomato sauces, the tableside Fettuccini delicious with a bit less sauce than what was featured prior while the rich Spinach Lasagna was delightfully decadent beneath Bolognese and creamy Bechamel.  Less successful with undercooked Carbonara and Truffle Tagliatelle that really has no business being served during the earliest days of Fall, a better bite is found amidst the Eggplant speckled Aumm Aumm or tender Linguini beneath blossoms and lightly bitter pesto, the Rigatoni no better than that from Michelina's while the meatballs atop spaghetti were damn near dehydrated while the larger ones served as a side were far more tender and less overwhelmed by spices.Almost as overpriced on zucchini blossoms as Wolfgang Puck's CUT while the flatbreads at Hearthstone far outperform the pricey Pizza all' Acqua, a 'best-bet' appetizer is more appropriately found in tartare or crudo, though those not trending to tomatoes as primi will also be impressed by the lightness of fried eggplant, the secondi selections of Chicken Parm or Veal Saltimbocca obviously a bit more substantial with the latter wrapped around Fontina and smoked Prosciutto actually quite stunning.Fairing well with the Lemon Chicken and what may very well be the best Piccata in town suffice it to say that the dry bomboli are a dish best skipped while Coconut Cake and Caprese Pie, both brought in from Peridot Sweets, are well worth ordering - as were the two celebratory cakes delivered for our family and friends outing.***At first looking like a place that may be interested in shaking up a stagnant Italian scene in the Western Suburbs it seems as though early on Salute has opted to instead play it safe, a bit of a shame considering the 'lightgroup' thumping music and prices not far off from those found on the Strip.So hopeful, but so disappointed. The food WAS good, however, there was a large bone in the middle of my chicken Parmesan, which I've never seen before, and did not care for. The risotto had noodles throughout it, which I've never seen before, and did not care for either. You can search, but you may never find a single smile on any of the wait staff's faces. Good luck. It was so flippin' loud inside the restaurant that you really can't carry on a conversation with anyone at the table other than the person directly next to you or across from you. There was 6 of us, so it made it very annoying. The water boys, bus boys, even the male manager on duty, we're all extremely attentive to the two ladies sitting at the table next to us in tiny dresses, fake lashes, big lips, etc... While we waited and waited for more water, and our empty dirty plates sat ignored for 20 minutes. Thanks for making us feel invisible because we didn't dress like Julia Roberts from Pretty Woman. Fail!

I came here for lunch last week.  I saw the demo of the old Vocelli's that was here. The V3 sign went up not too long after.  This is a new 'line' of stores that Vocelli's is testing out, from what I hear on the local pizza blog.  V3 is essentially a pizza form of Chipotle, but better.    You start on one end of the counter and choose your crust.  Traditional, Multigrain, Gluten-Free ($1 more).  The fresh doughball is then put through a machine to be pressed out into a rectangle and pressed onto the pan.  Then you choose your sauce and all your toppings.  You can choose one that they have already put together as well. It goes into the conveyor oven.  While it cooks, you pay for it.  It comes out on the other side and goes to the finishing station where you can add some olive oils, fresh basil, more cheese, etc.  Box it up and take it to-go, or eat inside the 2 level spacious area.  For $8 per pizza, you can't beat it.  You can get several toppings too; I'm talking 5-6 toppings and its still $8.  You best be gettin' to this place before there is a line out the door!  New favorite lunch calorie splurge.  Because this is a "make your own" place, there is no website or ordering over the phone.

In the Gainey Ranch Shops at the previous Cuttlefish location. Good size restaurant and vertical modern building. The old oyster bar from Cuttlefish with the scooter seats are transformed into a Bloody Mary Bar.Had the Build Your Own Scramble with Chorizo, Italian Sausage and Mushrooms which was excellent. It came with a small container of hash browns and a home made biscuit.  Everything was excellent,  the chorizo was just right not to hot but with enough kick to give it flavor.  The mushrooms were plentiful and the Italian Sausage was very good. The Hash Browns were good and the home made biscuit was fresh and soft.The disk jockey playing the music was different in a breakfast / lunch place. Was good to liven up the place but at times was difficult to hear the other person talk.The service  was excellent as our waiter Ryan made sure everything was right and for having a party of 14 he handled every need without an issue. Was also a nice touch that the owner came by to talk with us.Will be back to try the lunch menu and especially the burgers that looked very good on the menu2.25 stars!Hash Kitchen, how could you do that to me?  I so enjoyed my Thanksgiving breakfast this morning- Coconut & Almond Encrusted French Toast (regular menu) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-hash-kitchen-scottsdale?select=-tDp5pqC4GK8Jcd2V23Thw AND Sweet Potato Pancakes (November specials menu), and a taste of a neighbor's Herb Fried Chicken & Waffle. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-hash-kitchen-scottsdale?select=WIpasuMFsjcohJts0NiP0g  My LavAzza cappuccino, topped with a bit of cinnamon, was nice, and service was friendly, helpful, and patient-- thank you, Jessie! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-hash-kitchen-scottsdale?select=nhAKp1QchJnn54LKpKFcKw  I placed an order of Chicken & Waffle to-go, which was placed in a styrofoam box and plastic-bagged, unseen by me (some places show me what the food looks like before putting it away), and put into a paper bag underneath my other two boxes of leftover entrees.  I left happy and thankful for finding a cool breakfast spot I could return to again and again, or so I thought.Coconut & almond encrusted French toast, minus the powdered sugar, $13.   http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-hash-kitchen-scottsdale?select=My9fTOguFl-GmBtYzzUTiA  Delicious!  Loved the texture of the French toast, but I'll be sure to ask for the maple syrup on the side next time, both to control the amount of syrup I'm using, as well as to keep the toast as crisped as possible for later consumption.  Would order this again!Sweet potato pancakes, with maple-cranberry reduction and minus the powdered sugar, $9.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-hash-kitchen-scottsdale?select=mP0A1XXVwiWGEua-h-ZDDQ  Pancake texture was fine, and color was pretty.  Not off-putting to me... Jessie warned me of the color, but I've had SW pancakes before, so I was ready.  Dish was disappointing, and the maple-cranberry reduction was its saving grace, and I almost was not able to try, because, as the photo shows, I was originally given a container of maple syrup reduction.  I pointed this out to Jessie, who quickly retrieved the right sauce.  She also apologized for the mix-up.  I would skip this one, unless next year's version includes actual cubed sweet potatoes in it-- the pancakes need more texture, either from sweet potato, or a fruit compote.Tasting of Herb Fried Chicken & Waffle... http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-hash-kitchen-scottsdale?select=WIpasuMFsjcohJts0NiP0g  Delicious!  I'd already had in mind to order one to-go, and I was happy to find it was tasty after having a sample.  (I'd offered the two women to my left a taste of the French toast, which one of them accepted.  It was her friend who gave me this sample to taste.)Front page of regular menu http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-hash-kitchen-scottsdale?select=QxRhMyJEAwpk28C-mlLRFwHours later, after returning from a long walk, I began to compose in my mind what I thought was going to be a 3.5- to 4-star review as I started to warm up some dinner- a little bit of Filipino food, nilaga, that Mom made and a little slice of the chicken and waffle, which I was looking forward to, since that tiny teaser my counter neighbor let me have this morning.  I placed the cut of waffle and chicken into the toaster oven for a few minutes, and then plated it.  When I sliced a bit of waffle off, along with what I thought was chicken, I was surprised to find mostly cooked batter and what looked like a pinky-sized portion of chicken- what the hey?!  So, I went into the fridge again to get more chicken and sliced another tiny portion, and then decided to take a picture of what was left... I was left deflated-- the high I had experienced this morning, now reduced to resemble the sad portion of breaded chicken sitting in front of me.  This morning, I left thinking I'd return, but now am not so sure...Atmosphere of THK is almost the same as its incarnation, Cuttlefish, and THK is under the same ownership.  The beautiful white marble counter and the wood paneling separating the bar/counter and the restroom area, are still there, and the DIY Bloody Mary bar was a nice touch!  (Jars of differing cornichons, pickled veggies, spices, hot sauces, and olives galore, and for those so inclined, there were even jars of wrapped long Slim Jims on each end.)  Jessie provided great service and impressed me with knowing the ingredients of the entrees I had questions about, and at the same time did not hesitate to get confirmation from the kitchen.  I felt respected as a customer- no condescension or other negative vibes from her to keep me from returning.  So why was I sent home with such a mediocre plating of chicken and waffle???  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-hash-kitchen-scottsdale?select=Q50wbVHZEOn2Hl6DOOp36AJust wanted to update my rating of Hash Kitchen.  I received a note from HK's owner, Joey M., who apologized for the mishap concerning my Chicken & Waffle to-go order and offered a complimentary C&W should I return.  My first visit was for Thanksgiving brunch, and I wanted to do an update, so I brought Mom with me for her first visit and my second on 12/10/15.  I wanted to dine at the wide white-marbled bar, but my Mom favors booths... Thank goodness we were lucky enough to get a great server named Candace, because her friendliness and service made up for the small table space we had after all of our entrees arrived!We ordered two cappuccinos, the Coconut-almond French toast (of course!), http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-hash-kitchen-scottsdale?select=aMB8TgvRGkpKakkjY9wfqg the complimentary C&W, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-hash-kitchen-scottsdale?select=WPwSYtAYVTfNB-QSv25aoA and an item on the December specials menu- Gingerbread Pancakes! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-hash-kitchen-scottsdale?select=qoqgj_MWZJgrGGWqNXaUAg  This came with a dollop of cream cheese frosting and topped with gingerbread cookie crumble.  Loved that the frosting didn't contain powdered sugar in it and wasn't too sweet.  I am all about textures, so I loved the cake-yness of the pancakes and the different-sized crumbles of the cookies, which had a wonderful gingerbread flavor and essence to them.  Slathering on the cream cheese frosting, which I'd say almost had a butter consistency, gave the pancakes a creamy component.  My mouth, nose, and brain were happy!  Mom really enjoyed the French toast, which surprised the both of us, because she doesn't care for coconut!  (Well, that can't be true, because she loves to make "ginataan," a dessert consisting of different tubers, plantains, and rice cake/patties stewed in sweetened coconut milk.  It's more accurate to say she doesn't like coconut aroma in health/beauty products, such as shampoos and lotions.)  Well, she had two French toast halves, as well as a quarter waffle and a third of the two large fried chicken breast patties in our entree.  Mom said there were three!  I might agree-- all I know is that I had at least three times the amount of fried chicken breast that I received on my first visit.  While I thoroughly enjoyed this visit's version of French toast, this was different from the first, which I felt was a little more tender, less caramelized.  I LOVED both versions!  If my future visits are as delightful as these two were, I feel like I could rate this breakfast eatery five stars!  Service is always friendly, and I haven't felt any negative vibes whenever I inquire about certain ingredients in entrees.  I do feel that HK could improve their mochas in their coffee menu by offering a higher-end chocolate product than the standard chocolate syrup (which contains corn syrup).  Mom did enjoy the mocha she had in lieu of the cappuccino that she didn't like, but she's not as picky about ingredients as I am.  I thank the owner Joey M. and GM Linda Rossow, who both came out and met us.  (Well, I asked if the owner was around, since he asked me to look for him the next time I visited.)  They were friendly and warm, and I could tell that they really liked what they have created with THK.  Linda told us about the BBQ place next door, which replaced Notorious Burgers.  Mom and I will have to try the brisket soon!

I walked-in and wanted to hate this place, but it wasn't really that bad. I was searching for a hot and new spot via the Yelp app and the People's Republic came up. This place is located next to the Harley Davidson Cafe and Chili's. I know, I know, how many red flags must I ignore before the ultimate demise of my palate.During my search I noticed a check-in offer for a free soft pretzel with the purchase of 20oz Porterhouse steak, really? I'm going to buy a thirty-two dollar steak in hopes of getting a soft pretzel, c'mon guys! Here's the kicker they don't even offer the 20oz anymore, now it's a 16oz Porterhouse. The style of this place is a tad confusing, it looks like sports bar, but with stained glass windows and a lot of brick, it could maybe pass for an English pub? My server (Jason) came by and was very personable and fast. He took our orders promptly and even gave us some recommendations and info about the menu.  Still nothing on the menu really intrigued me except for the loco moco balls. I also ordered deep fried artichoke and a breakfast pizza. The Loco Moco balls were interesting. Hand shaped rice balls with spam inside instead of hamburger meat, then deep-fried and served with a side of gravy. These were probably the best the thing of the night and that's not saying much. Way too much rice and hardly any spam inside, plus the side of gravy was clearly from a packet. The Fried artichoke was ok, but the dipping sauce that it came with completely overpowered any artichoke flavor. The Breakfast Pizza... Oh, the Breakfast Pizza. It was processed cubed ham, bagged cheese and sauce from a can, all on flat bread with a fried egg. Guys, when you have people scrutinizing every bite of every meal now-a-days it would really behoove you to not cut corners and get real products on the menu.This place could be good, but the food fell so flat that Wile E. Coyote even winced. The service was on point and the view from the patio was great, just not great enough to save my experience.

Review Text :
A new launched Boba / Tea / Asian & Hawaiian Fusion on south Rainbow, Clean and Spacious. Its grand opening will be in November. Their brew tea is made to order from the TEAPRESSO equipment, and you can choose your preferred sweetness level and ice. But the flavored tea will come with at least 50% sweetness if you need to know. They also have various toppings for the customers to choose, such as jelly, crystal boba and popping boba (they all come with diverse flavors), egg pudding and red bean.. etc.We tried 4 different flavored tea and 3 dishes there: - Passion Fruit Tea with Red Bean: This is my favorite! Great passion fruit taste with the perfectly brewed tea, fresh and impressive. The red bean is soft and well-cooked, too.- White Peach Tea with Lychee jelly: Extremely fresh taste with rich flavored Lychee jelly, just perfect for summer time or to wake you up like the breeze.- Taro Milk Tea with Crystal Boba: Great milk tea with beautiful color from taro. Crystal Boba is interesting to try if you haven't had it before. - Black Milk Tea with Boba and Egg Pudding - I think they make the best Boba in town, chewy and not too hard. Too bad that they ran out of Grass Jelly, I am sure I will go back to try it next visit. Wish them to  provide the real milk instead of just creamer to make the milk tea tho. * Cake Noodles with Grilled Chicken: This is something new to me, and I haven't seen any other restaurants having it. It is really good, especially if you were a big fan of HK style noodles. The chicken is so juicy and tender. Highly recommended! * Drunken Noodles: It won me with the saporous basil favor!  * Mango Fried Rice with Cashew and Chinese Shredded Pork: Fried Rice is something simple but requires excellent skill to cook. I believe they have really talented and experienced chefs to make the fried rice flavorful but not greasy.Seems like Southwest side of Vegas is stepping up their boba game lately. Brew Tea Bar was a big hit, and now Boba Hut? Good spot for studying since they have ample selection of food and drinks, just like beloved Fresh Cup Café that I forever miss. ATMOSPHEREBright and clean. They have around six tables, all with comfy chairs. Music playing in the background added to the casual vibe but it was kind of loud in my opinion (maybe because I was there to study). They left both of the doors wide open and welcomed all the flies in. I was surrounded by flies at one point. Great.SERVICEMy cashier wasn't too friendly but they are still on soft opening so I guess it's ok for now. I was the only one there but it took at least 15 mins for my drink to be ready. Meh.DRINKI always order Jasmine Milk Tea whenever I try a new boba shop. I noticed that they have two types: Milk Green Tea and Jasmine Milk Tea. I believe Milk Green Tea is premade and Jasmine Milk Tea is made with freshly brewed tea. My cashier recommended Jasmine Milk Tea because it has more tea flavor. They only have one size for drink (24oz) and my drink came out to be $3.46 with their promotional discount.Wow! Strong green tea flavor, tad bit bitter and not overwhelming. I got mine at 100% sweetness, would get it at 70% next time because it was too sweet for my liking. I got their honey boba but it tasted bland. Boba was cooked perfectly, just wished it had more honey flavor. CONCLUSIONI went lenient on the star rating since they are still under soft opening. I am not really a fan yet but am willing to give them another try. Make sure to visit before November to get 20% off your order!I came back to Boba Hut for a study session. I am glad to see some improvements and this time around got to try some of their food. My final verdict is...this place is not bad, but not my most favorite.SERVICEA lot more welcoming than the last time. Unlike the attitude I got from a girl on my last visit, this guy at the counter was friendly and helpful in deciding which drink I should get. He personally handed the drink to me and told me I can make adjustments to my drink, which is something the girl never said in my last visit. DRINK/FOODDrinks I have tried so far:Jasmine Milk Tea- 100% is too sweet for my liking but still my favorite out of all the drinks I have tried. 5/5Whitegourd Green Milk Tea- ordered at 75% sweetness and added honey boba. Despite the ridiculously sweet taste of white gourd, I still tasted tea. I must say they brew some good teas here. 4/5Coffee Milk Tea-100% sweetness was good. Strong black tea with few shots of espresso. Perfect for all-nighter. 4/5White Peach Oolong Tea-just ok. I was surprised to see how much ice they put in this drink. Very subtle peach flavor and strong oolong tea. 3/5White Grape Oolong Tea-pretty good! Very light grape flavor and tea flavor but refreshing. 100% sweetness was bit too sweet for me. Unique flavor that I haven't had in other places. 4/5Cantaloupe Milk Tea-75% sweetness turned out to be too sweet once again. Similar to Honeydew Milk Tea, maybe a tad bit sweeter. 3/5Taiwanese popcorn chicken was something different. It came with seasoning which was on the saltier side. Their popcorn chicken, French fries and sweet potato fries are perfect snacks to order on the side.CONCLUSIONTheir teaspresso is amazing. No matter what flavor you get, you can always taste a hint of tea. I personally think their teas are brewed stronger than Brew Tea Bar or Kung Fu Tea. Try their teas! Also, go 50% or 75% sweetness level as many of the drinks they serve are extremely sweet to begin with.I came for the wintermelon milk tea and they sure met my expectations! Another great addition to Rainbow Blvd's awesome Asian food lineup. Boba hut offers different drink flavors, combinations, and toppings you cannot get anywhere else in Las Vegas. They are able to stand up to the stiff competition, no doubt! This is a Chinese Hawaiian fusion place serving up legit brewed tea boba drinks and Hawaiian comfort food.  Their tea game is strong and they use a Teapresso machine. The way to order your drinks is to:1) Pick your base ($3.00): black tea, black milk tea, green tea, or green milk tea. Available in hot or cold. 2) Add flavor ($0.50): plum, peach, mango, lychee, grapefruit, cantaloupe, pineapple, strawberry, honeydew, passionfruit, wintermelon, and peppermint! 3) Sweetness level: 0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100%.*Their drinks are pretty sweet here. Personal recommendation...I order either 50%-75%.4) Add toppings ($0.50): honey boba, rainbow jelly, mango jelly, lychee jelly, coffee jelly, red bean, egg pudding, grass jelly pudding, crystal boba, aloe, and popping boba. Other drink menu items include: specialty drinks like taro milk tea, thai tea, teaspresso drinks, and more! Also, slushes, non-caffeinated drinks, and smoothies.  If you have a sweet tooth, they have 6 different desserts like malasadas and various tofu puddings! Here's what I was able to try:- wintermelon milk tea w/ grass jelly- lychee black tea w/ honey boba- white grape oolong teapresso- cake noodles with chicken- popcorn chicken- spam and candy bacon musubi- crystal boba (sample) I thought their drinks were really good, but needed fine tuning on my part. If you are familiar with wintermelon tea, it is very sweet on it's own. I ordered this at 75% sweetness and it was too sweet for me. Next time, 50% should perfect it! Their tea is strong and very refreshing! The tea does not get muddled at all by flavors or toppings. Crystal boba is not for everyone. I did not like it. It's not starch based like honey boba. It is just a flavorless, clear agar jelly. Food was hit or miss, but shows a lot of promise. I am super picky with popcorn chicken and this was a miss. It was very bland and missing the seasoning that I am used too. No spicy levels either, just plain ol' popcorn chicken and some fried basil.  A Chinese Hawaiian comfort dish I was able to try for the first time is the cake noodles with chicken...and it was really good! The spam and candy bacon musubi was good, but could use a thicker piece of spam, due to the ratio of rice. I am pretty amazed with this place and the friendly and prompt service I received. All food and drinks came out in a timely manner. It is pretty spacious compared to other boba places. Some items I look forward to trying:- Hawaiian slush (pineapple, mango, li hing mui)- Pork belly loco moco- Drunken noodles- Saimin/macaroni soup- Desserts! I wish I could keep this place a secret, but I love supporting small business and so should you! :)Aloha spirit is here, service is genuinely excited to have you stop in, and they provide samples of favorite drinks! Though the name and menu mostly focus on drinks (hot/cold, caffeinated/non, tea, smoothies, etc.), there are also a few Chinese-Hawaiian dishes for small meals and snacks.The green tea with peppermint and boba, 25% sweetness, was strongly flavored and nicely sized, while the green milk tea with peach and coffee jelly was a little too weird for my taste. Added on a breakfast musubi (spam, egg, and candy bacon) and it knocked my socks off- would come back to try other dishes, quality of food is better than similar spots that offer quick-reheat options.

Usually when a place first opens it hits or misses.  This place hit!  Didn't even know this place existed until our friends insisted we leave our happy hour to do their happy hour.  We were not disappointed in the food, value or service.  All were great.  Great list of food and drink happy hour items.  Great school vibe with cleaver decor including the style of the menus.   They had jenga and beer pong on their big outside patio. Fun to play or even watch.  We will be back and recommend this spot to others!Terrible. Just checked out this place for the first time and I may never go back. Our waiter was very very nice but I waited 10 minutes before I was asked if I needed a menu. After 5 different servers came by my table I realized the management wasn't in order. My fiancé ordered a mojito which took 21 minutes to arrive. They were also out of three of beers I tried to order.Great idea at this place but definitely need to figure out how to run a team of servers. Maybe MAYBE will try in a couple months after they work out the kinks.I saw pictures of a mythical dessert called Nutella Cookie Sandwich. For a week, I've been imagining what it could possibly taste like and feel like until I've finally decided to try it.By the entrance is a glass display with sports trophies, Pom poms, Michael Jordan lunchbox, algebra book, calculus book and all things that would remind you of school minus the nun that smacks your hand with a ruler because this is Public School 702. You just get budget cuts.The menu would remind you of a notebook and the napkins would remind you of a notepad. Blackboards on the wall and the moon and planets above your head. Hipsters with their glasses, beards, sleeve tats and a beer. 90's hip hop playing in the background.We tried the grilled salmon, bison burger, chicken and waffles and the Nutella Cookie Sandwich. The entrees were just ok. The bison burger had a nice spicy kick to it but I also almost had an anaphylactic reaction because of an ingredient that wasn't on the menu description but was somehow in burger. The fries were not great.The Nutella Cookie Sandwich would be the only reason I'd come back here. So, you get chocolate chip cookies with Nutella schmeared on the flat side of the cookies, vanilla ice cream in the middle with a wall of bacon brittle. "I got 5 on it"...yup, it's only $5 that's big enough for 2-3 people.The service could use remedial lessons.Super excited for a new gastropub near me! Vegas needs to get down with gastropubs and open up more. First off, the structure itself is really awesome. From the patio, the decor to the vibes. They have an excellent craft brew selection and the food was excellent. No complaints on that!The only thing was service. I really struggled giving this place 4 stars but I had to go with 3 because our waiter was horrible. He was super nice, but he literally never checked on us and kept forgetting our drinks. We kept having to ask other waiters to get them for us. I don't think it was his area, but still, he wasn't busy. We went on a Sunday night at 8 and didn't leave until 10 because it took forever to get anything. That's a huge downer.For the beer: I had Dawn of the Red. It was amazing. It's a hoppier amber with fruit notes. It's now one of my favorites. Food: Fiery Calamari - very good and fried perfectly. It wasn't spicy at all though.Shrimp and Grits -  It was super tasty. The grits are more of a grits cake and it has so much in it with a ton of flavor. The sauce was very rich and spicy. Beef short rib with parmesan mashed potatoes - it was very good and the au jus gravy was very rich. The NUTELLA COOKIE SANDWICH. I'm going to be 100% honest. I'm not a dessert person. But when I saw this cookie on Yelp, I decided to go here solely for that purpose. And friends, it did NOT disappoint. It was the best cookie and ice cream dessert I've ever had in my life. The cookie was all gooey and soft. So perfect. Overall - I loved this place. I saw other servers being super tentative to their tables. We just got super unlucky. I would love to go again soon to try out other dishes and other yummy beers.We arrived on a Tuesday night, around 8 pm. It was surprisingly busy. We requested to sit on the patio and the hostess said it would be just a minute while they set our table up. I'm almost positive she forgot about us. We stood there for over ten minutes. Another hostess asked if we were waiting for someone, when we replied that we were waiting for the table, she looked around a little confused. When we were finally sat at the table that had been ready for almost ten minutes, we were handed menus. We looked them over and got excited about all the delicious options to eat and drink. Lots of craft beers on their menu (see photo). We asked for water while we looked over the menus. Another server came over and took our drink order. My boyfriend got the lavender vanilla and I ordered a Cabernet. We received our drinks, but still no water. My wine was fantastic and my boyfriends drink was perfect for sipping (I'm not really into whiskey, but it was good). We ordered the quinoa poblano prepared vegan with no cheese, broccolini prepared vegan with sautéed garlic, kale slaw with Brussels prepared vegan, and the brown bag potato fries (not vegan) but for my boyfriend;). Our server came to the table with water (finally) and some bad news. The poblano couldn't be prepped vegan:( it's prepped with cheese, and so is the kale shaved Brussels:(. Back to the menu... I opted for the veggie chili that's created with a mushroom thickening base (vegan). Granted it was 100+ degrees outside I wasn't super excited but it worked. My boyfriend ordered the chorizo Mac and cheese, since we couldn't share the poblano. Our food eventually arrived, but my chili had some cream on top... Had to send it back and wait again. The broccolini was amazing. Perfectly seasoned and sautéed to a crisp crunch. We finished it in no time. We were being attacked by bugs by the time my food made it to the table. Bug lights would be ideal for their patio. The chili was awesome. It came with a kale waffle I couldn't eat but it was filling by itself. Overall... It was a good meal. A little disorganized and patience was definitely a virtue we were practicing that evening. Would I return? Yes, happy hours on the patio with my laptop, school books, and boyfriend are going to be ideal considering they have convenient USB and outlets located on every booth. It's pretty new... Practice your patience... It has a lot of potential.This place is awesoooooooooooome!!!! Cool vibe, nice interior, lovely outdoor patio. Came here on a Wednesday night with some girls, and a DJ was playing some awesome 90's hip hop, alternating with some karaoke action. Bacon and cheddar tater tots- 4/5. Everyone loved it but I thought it was good. Summer succotash- 4/5. Good stuff but not to die for. First time eating succotash and apparently it doesn't get any better than this. Deviled eggs-3/5. Good but nothing special. Truffle fries- 4/5 Good but I've had better. Mezza plate- 3/5.  The waiter recommended this. I didn't think the hummus and anything else was that great except for the fried garbanzo bean that was crunchy on the outside. Shrimp and grits- 5 stars!!!!!!!!!!! Great sauce flavor, shrimp was perfectly cooked, and the grits patty that looks like a hash brown was absolutely delicious. I'd come back for this dish hands down. Phenomenal selection of beers available here. One extra star for carrying my fave beer...Greenflash IPA. Service was excellent. It's slow because it was busy, but our waiter Jared was super helpful, friendly, and made sure we were taken care of though keep in mind service is generally slow and our food took a while to arrive. Kyle, the GM came by to say hello and he was super nice as well. I like the ambiance of this place, and the DJ who played awesome music really made the night for me. Met a lot of cool locals. I'd definitely come back to try the jidori fried chicken as well as their burgers. Kudos to Jared for putting up with us ladies on our girls night out! ;)This teacher loves recess... AKA, Happy Hour at PS702! I dig the school theme, which carries throughout the restaurant décor (math flashcards clipped up around the bar) and menu (shareable portions are in a section called "study group"). They're a theme restaurant without being tacky about it.FARRO & BRUSSELS SPROUTS SALAD: surprisingly filling, this could be a late lunch. The sweet curry vinaigrette is interesting and there are a lot of contrasting textures.CRISPY CAULIFLOWER: The breading is super-thin and slightly spicy, with buffalo and bleu dipping sauces, served in a mini cast iron skillet. One of the better versions I've had, not greasy!PARM-TRUFFLE FRITES: You know you want them. They smell great, but let's get real, everyone has fancy fries these days, right? These come with a spicy ketchup and lemon aioli. Get 'em.SPECK & EGGS: Another dish everyone has, with the PS touch adding crispy prosciutto and a kick of spice.  Nicely creamy filling.CRISPY AHI TUNA TACOS: You can't go wrong with ahi. Tiny wonton shells filled with avocado and ahi, lightly dressed in ponzu. One of the lighter options, pairs well with the salad above.PB&J SLIDERS: The dish I was most excited about and the only one I was underwhelmed by. Menu only states "blackberry habanero jam with smoked bacon" and for some reason my eyes interpreted the word "slider" as a mini sandwich, most likely heated, on a thick challa-style bread. It's actually 3 typical sliders (mini patty and bun) with the two condiments gracelessly smeared on. With less PB and more J, this might have been palatable but dry beef + sticky PB = Nope.All of this, with a beer and tip, for ~$40 can easily feed three. Service was awesome when it was around, bar staff were constantly busy to the point of being overwhelmed. Our server apparently went home altogether, and after nearly half an hour of waiting around to close our tab, Kourtnie kindly took care of us. Not sure I'd come back outside of recess hours, but it's definitely fun. The food is approachable with some innovative twists rather than the standard safe staples I expected.Fun atmosphere and interesting spins on some traditional food.This space is a lot of fun and themed! Who doesn't enjoy a fun back to school moment? There's books, note pads, globes and so many fun decorations. The noise level is really loud so I wouldn't recommend coming here for romance or good conversation. We ordered some liquor and the jungle juice got me a mild buzz, thanks bartender! I love it when you can't taste it but you can definitely feel it!We decided on their take of deviled eggs which had a kick to them. I prefer good ol traditional ones which I can't seem to find anywhere I go. Next came the margarita pizza which again had a kick & again I prefer a traditional approach. I have to comment on the nicely done thin & crispy crust which I really enjoyed. And now we get to the charcuterie board...pretty damn great! Cheese with crackers or bread and jam or honey is my thing! I can't help myself and they offered a really nice balance of mild, sweet & savory items and I enjoyed them all. Our waitress was awesome tonight and overall we had a good time. I'm very interested in going back & trying more items. Note - they have a very large outdoor patio area but we couldn't do it tonight because it feels like hell outside.We tried Public School 702 shortly after they opened for business.We started with a couple of appetizers. I didn't love the calamari, but I typically don't enjoy fried calamari so that wasn't too surprising. The tater tots were the highlight of the appetizers. For an entree I ordered the cobb burger and chose the kale and brussel sprout slaw. When my food came they had given me fries instead, but quickly noticed their error and brought me the slaw. The burger was cooked perfectly and the flavors were great. Lots of bleu cheese and drippy egg and the slaw was on point as well. I enjoyed my meal quite a bit. The service was very attentive. Some were a bit overzealous since the restaurant just opened but I appreciated the extra effort. I'd be interested in coming back to try more of their menu and possibly happy hour someTime soon.Having wanted to try the original downtown LA location for the longest time, and just never getting the chance to, Public School 702 was probably one of my more anticipated restaurant openings this year. This new location in Downtown Summerlin sits on the upper level between Crave, and the yet to open second Shake Shack. It's a pretty large space with a lot of seating, a good size bar area, and an outdoor patio as well. But even with all that, it gets busy, and you'll likely have to wait for a table. For just 2 people at 7:30 on a Wednesday night, the wait still tipped 30 minutes.After being seated, we were handed their regular notebook style menu that has a quite a few appetizers, and all kinds of entrees from burgers to chicken and waffles. We were also handed a separate list of their current rotating tap beers. That's one of my favorite parts about PS702. Not only is there "normal" beer list all craft offerings, but their rotating stuff seems to be filled with unique and even some hard to find limited release stuff. If you're not a beer drinker though, they've got plenty of cocktails and wines too.Since there was only 2 of us and pretty much every appetizer on the menu sounded good, we decided to get a few items to share, and then split one dinner. We started off with some of the smaller items, the Speck & Eggs, and the Crispy Buffalo Cauliflower. At just $6 for either of these, they are must try starters in my opinion. The eggs were perfectly boiled, had a creamy yok filling, and the little piece of proscuitto was a nice salty, crispy touch. And the buffalo cauliflower was excellent. We've had a few different versions of it at other places in California, where it seems to be more popular, and PS702's was excellent. It's got a thicker breading and was served piping hot with sauce on the side, instead of tossed.The other appetizers we tried were a little on the bigger side. Their Mezze Plate is huge for $8 and includes 5 different things to pick off or dip in, and huge stack of thin, crispy pita-like bread. My favorite things were the marinated feta, and something I had never had anywhere else before, crispy chickpeas. We also really enjoyd the Chorizo Mac & Cheese. It was the most expensive starter we got at $9, but well worth it. The pasta was cooked perfectly, it's super cheesy, there's plenty of chorizo in it, and even though I thought it was strange at first, the salt and vinegar chips on top added both flavor and texture.By this time, we were pretty full, but our order of the Fried Jidori Chicken & Green Chili Cornbread Waffles was already on the way. Sadly, it didn't impress nearly as much as the appetizers, especially with it's $22 price tag. I personally really liked the slightly spicy waffle with the cornbread like texture, but the wifey wasn't a fan. And even though the flavor on the chicken was excellent, it was mushy and only one part, a leg, was bone-in. The gravy had good flavor as well, but because the chicken was soggy, it made the whole dish just overly mushy. Had the chicken been crispy, this would have been a huge hit for me.Unlike a lot of the other reviews, our service was excellent. We even found out later on during our meal that our waiter was in training. He did an excellent job though, and no complaints from me at all in the area.PS702 is a little on the pricy side, especially when you get drinks, but it's not out of this world crazy. With both of us getting drinks, then adding on 4 appetizers and a main entree, we only spent about $90 with tip. Besides the main chicken and waffles dish being a bit of a let down, it was well worth it, and I've got to say PS702 is one of my new favorites in Downtown Summerlin, so I can't wait to go back.My husband and I had a FEAST at Public School 702 on a Monday evening during happy hour. Happy Hour specials are available in the bar area and outside on the patio Mon-Fri from 3:30PM - 6:30PM. We ended up out on the patio with a nice view of Downtown Summerlin. I'm thanking my lucky stars we stumbled in here just in time for "Recess".  CRISPY CAULIFLOWER ($4 HH): The favorite of the evening. According to the menu, it's supposed to be served with blue cheese dressing AND buffalo sauce but we only got the blue cheese. The cauliflower is amazing! I'd highly recommend getting an order of these. 5/5 PARMESAN TRUFFLE FRIES ($4 HH): A large portion of flavorful fries, but neither of us cared for the lemon aioli. They tasted better straight up! 4/5MARGHERITA PIZZA ($6 HH): Lightly dusted with red pepper flakes and a pinch of basil leaves. Would have liked for there to be more basil and less charred black dustiness on the crust. 3/5CRISPY NAKED WINGS ($6 HH): Came with 7 or 8 good-sized wings and my guy thought they tasted great. We learned Public School 702 does not serve ranch and that their sauces are made from scratch. 4/5CHORIZO MAC & CHEESE ($7 HH): Sans the chorizo so we could both share. The vinegar potato chips layered on top added an unexpected crunch, as did the surprise arugula. The mac & cheese was slightly spicy because of red pepper flakes in the dish - wise choice. 4/5   FOUNTAIN DRINKS ($2.75 HH): My husband ordered a coke and it came in one of those cutsie bottles. Unfortunately, refills are not free. The extra coke was $1.50. What are we, in Europe? I just had water, and our server left a nice vase of water at the table so I could get all the refills I wanted. 2/5VIBE: Public School 702 has a class act theme, complete with menus that look like old school notebooks, chalkboards displaying the specials, and an awesome galaxy set up that would win any science fair competition in the main dining area. This new gastro pub feels industrial and trendy, and I love it here! 5/5 SERVICE: Selina was an awesome server! She checked up on us often and was super nice. 4/5Worth a Return Visit?There's still so many Happy Hour menu items I'm dying to try. And, I will definitely get the legendary Nutella Cookie dessert Yelpers are talking about next time I visit! Two thumbs up Public School 702.YELP 100 CHALLENGE 2015: #187I don't know how I haven't written a review for this place, yet. I certainly thought I had.I've been here twice now; once with the husband, once with a girlfriend for happy hour.My husband and I are calamari lovers. There is this calamari in Georgetown in Washington DC that is so good that it is the "bar" in which we judge all others. Public School's calamari is even better than that. It is THE calamari to compare all others. Perfectly tender, perfectly battered, and complimented with this ginger aioli, it is impeccable.I've had a burger, ahi tacos from the happy hour menu, and bangers and mash. They are all awesome. The BEST part of the entire meal, besides the calamari, is the slaw that you can substitute instead of fries. It is lemon-y, crispy, crunchy, and fresh. I would have licked my plate if not in public.Go eat here. You won't be disappointed.It was pretty underwhelming on my first visit. Again, I usually don't write a review after 1 visit.. but we were pretty unhappy when we left. It started with arriving at 10 pm after being told that the menu goes until 1 am. Not so.. late night menu started at 10 pm appearantly. There was a pretty mediocre selection of food at that point, but we figured we drove all the way out there so we would give it a try. This was after we were given the full menu. But here's how it all went.. We ordered drinks and found seats at the bar. Sat in front of a bartender that cleaned her well for literally 15 minutes without even looking up. Like, literally a foot from my face. Nothin. So my friend says, "what time do you close?" She says - "it's different every day," and she went back to cleaning. My other buddy says, "but we can still order food right?" She says nothing, hands us late night menus, and a full menu and continues cleaning. Without any other explanation. So we waited patiently as she polished the grate for the well, wiped it down and then walked away. it was bewildering. My buddy had to ask another bartender that was passing by if we could order. The bartender said, "well what time is it?" LOL! I said i's about 1030.. he said "ooooh let me check..." he says. He gave us a thumbs up from the other end of the bar but did not return to take the order. So when he came to our end of the bar again - about 5 minutes later to pour a draft beer, my buddy just started ordering out loud. haha.. I mean we had no intention of being rude.. but we were trying way too hard to order, like no-one was interested in serving us. We all had all worked and were there to eat. Very hungry. There were 3 bartenders, and literally 9 people at the bar.. we were the only ones trying to eat, and just could not get service. So now I'm watching the original female bartender that was cleaning her bar well in front of us. She grabs a glass water bottle.. drinks from it, then grabs a bottle of what appeared to be lemon juice from the bar well - and we all watched as she poured lemon juice into her water bottle. She did this by touching the mouth of the lemon juice bottle to the mouth of the bottle she just drank from, then put the juice bottle back in the well. I'm in no way squeemish, though that's just kind of gross, not to mention just wrong. So far - wtf. So the food.. we finally had a chance to order and were told only the late night menu was available.. after all that  time..we made some decisions and were informed we couldn't order them. This is were an explanation when dropping the menus would have been helpful. So we ordered Calamari, flavor was ok, not crispy AT ALL despite being fried.. I mean, literally soggy. Naked wings, all flats, no drums, which was weird but they were crispy and good.. deviled eggs.. good.. but the presentation were those of eggs that had been prepared and set out for a few minutes because the yolks were not looking so fresh, also we ordered truffle fries. The fries SUCKED. Seriously. Luke-warm, soggy, and served with preserved lemon aioli? I didn't understand that, I liked the aioli but not with these fries (that's just me).. They did not get eaten, yet taken away by the bartender without question as to whether we were done or if there was some reason it was over 75% unfinished. So there's that.Still very hungry we decided on the FIG and Prosciutto Pizza and Taleggio and Mushroom pizza. I'm not even going to go into it becuase both were very sloppy in presentation and just mediocre in flavor overall. Honestly. We ate most of the Fig and Prosciutto and less than half of the Mushroom Taleggio. What I will say about he pizzas -  is that the female food runner that brought the food over, literally shoved my drink to the side as I was trying to move the dirty plates from the previous course out of the way, then quite obviously tossed both pizza plates onto the bar and walked away. I spun around like.. wtf? my buddies both just laughed because we were so just over it at this point. She looked miserable, and was taking it out on us! haha.. it's laughable in retrospect, but I mean really?! She then walked to the end of the bar by the service well and started chewing on her finger nails. No Joke. Ok, so listen.. I am not trying to just be an angry diner about this.. but i'll say it again: There is absolutely no reason for medocire food, or service in a town like Las Vegas. There are too many choices where people actually want to do the right thing, and serve a quality product.This experience was a fail, and we are all easy-going foodie kind of people. I have no intention to go back to PUBLIC SCHOOL 702, soley based on the service. I would have liked to try the regular menu, but this experience was just a bust for me. Sorry - Happy Eating to you though!I absolutely LOVE this place. The food is great and the atmosphere is relaxing. No matter how full you get, you must save room for dessert. Oh - and you should ask for Vanessa to be your food server, she made our first experience at PS702 a lasting one! When I review, 5-stars are really reserved for all around excellence. If customer service isn't there and the food and atmosphere are awesome, I generally downgrade to 4-stars. So - kudos to PS702 for impressing me in all areas (e.g., food quality, service, atmosphere, cleanliness). We started with the Crispy Cauliflower. I know that might not sound very appetizing but it was. It comes with two sauces and the buffalo hot sauce is the bomb with cauliflower!Then we each had a sandwich. He had the Crispy Chicken Sandwich with French fries and I had the Colorado Lamb Burger with quinoa and feta. YUMMY! My burger was perfect. The bun complimented the burger and held up until the very last morsel was gone. Most buns seem to get soggy - not this one! Thanks for the suggestions Vanessa! With my meal, I had a pear cider and he had a bottle of sprite. I like the whole small soda bottles as it fits into the overall "recess" school lunch time theme. I just think maybe knocking off a $1.00 would make the PARENTS a little happier. $2.75 for a small 8 oz soda is steep, especially on a hot day when drinking five of those could easily happen. Good thing I decided to have a cold cider.I was pretty full after our meal but managed to get talked into sharing a dessert ("Please MOM please" - Grin Grin Grin). We ordered the Cookie Sandwich with Nutella. This was super good! I can't wait to come back during the evening or when it is a little cooler outside. The patio is beautiful!

Review Text :
Four of us met for brunch this morning so we could have some of the breakfast menu and some of the lunch menu.  Items ordered were:Chocolate Nutella pancakesChallah French toastChicken and waffleFat Irish Green house made corned beef hash.Monte Cristo sandwichMiami Cuban sandwichPulled pork sandwichChicken pot pieEggplant parmigianaMeatballsBread puddingCaramel turtle pieThis is a 3 star restaurant working on it s fourth star.  As Siegel's 1941 has only recently opened, there are bound to be a few kinks but the restaurant is a solid place to eat.  The restaurant has been completely renovated from when it was the steakhouse for the El Cortez.  I was sorry to see that go, but I was happy to see what they did for a replacement.  While more open and more open to the casino than the former steakhouse, I'm glad to see how they've given honors to Benjamin Siegel for when he had partial ownership of the El Cortez.  Also prominent in the decorations are photos of his girlfriend Virginia Hill.Now the food.  The restaurant did a better job with the savory dishes than the sweet breakfast ones.  The Cuban, Monte Cristo, corned beef hash, and chicken pot pie were the standouts of the savory items.  The chicken and waffle was good as was the French toast.  The chocolate Nutella pancakes were a disappointment.  I expected something more than sloshing on some Nutella on top of pancakes.  There were a few glitches in the kitchen.  We ordered eggplant parmigiana but got chicken parmigiana.  We also ordered just meatballs but we got spaghetti and meatballs.  These are the issue which need to be worked out.Our server, Claudia, did an outstanding job.  She almost singlehandedly served the food to this hungry foursome.  I'd return for the corned beef hash if for breakfast and I will definitely return for the chicken pot pie.  I cannot give that high enough praise.Thanks to Mr. Farber for stopping by to check on us and see that all was well.  When they get some of their newness worked out, this can be a 4 star restaurant.Perhaps the most aspiring downtown hotel dining project in recent memory, and one that instantly sparked interest given the 24/7 concept within the historic El Cortez, it was with three friends that a four-course feast was enjoyed at Siegel's 1941, the sizeable space and immense menu showing promise of great things to come despite only officially being open for five days at the time of our mid-morning arrival.Inspired by Bugsy Siegel, an early investor in the El Cortez, with a soundtrack that veers vintage as Rat Pack classics float beneath gilded ceilings overhead, Siegel's 1941 features several touches harkening the era for which it is themed and with Virginia Hill gazing on over wood and red leather the menu is wide-reaching with breakfast, 'all-day,' and late-nite versions offered depending on the time, the transition from breakfast occurring at 11:00am proving the impetus for the party's 10:15am reserved table.Managed by Scott Farber and conceptualized by ESPLV, a design group behind several local restaurants with varying degrees of value, it would seem obvious that a concept as aggressive as Sigel's 1941 would be marred by a few issues in its opening days, and fully admitting that staff/kitchen transitions are one of those 'kinks' it was no-doubt a pleasant surprise that saw Scott diligently looking over his team throughout the stay, a middle-aged Hispanic woman providing almost universally impressive service given the complex coursing of the order, while a few kitchen delays and errors in execution seemed a bit more egregious - the chicken sent in place of requested eggplant, while a side of meatballs was instead served as the spaghetti centered entrée with a whole lot of watery noodles eventually going to waste.Beginning with breakfast, a few cups of coffee as well as orange juice, milk, plus a cocktail all brought along with water with refills rarely requiring a request, course one saw four plates delivered and while the flaccid pancakes with a simple spread of nutella could have benefitted from a bit more imagination both the chicken and waffles beneath peppery sausage gravy and the challah French Toast were as good as any served within a local diner, the use of 100% pure maple syrup a definite highlight, as was the quality of house-made corned beef acting to anchor a hash that featured golden-brown potatoes and lightly seared red peppers alongside a pair of poached eggs.Designating round two as 'the sandwich course,' it was on the advice of EatingLV that 'the city's best Cuban' was ordered, and served with fries on a silver tray one would be hard pressed to argue with such an assessment, particularly as relates to authenticity, as each ingredient melded nicely between layers of toasty pressed bread, the 'Monte Cristo' equally tasty and loaded with ham despite missing an opportunity to be the only deep-fried version currently offered in Sin City while the 'Carolina' pulled pork was unfortunately quite dreadful, a total lack of vinegar in either the pig or the slaw not at all resembling the stuff served in the Southeast while the bun was a soggy mess mere seconds after arrival.Receiving repeat apologies for a delay that stretched just under forty minutes at the midpoint of the meal, it was almost as though the extra time only served to confuse the kitchen since the aforementioned mistakes were sent out despite being correctly listed on the ticket, but thankfully not meeting any harboring a distaste for animal flesh as the enormous chicken parmesan was an exceedingly high quality rendition with light breading and good sauce while meatballs were unfortunately a bit dry and almost entirely devoid of spice, the pot pie undoubtedly proving a far more worthwhile bite as golden puff pastry formed a buttery dome over a creamy potage chockablock full of chicken and vegetables that outdid many more expensive versions found elsewhere in Sin City.Not yet dialing in the dessert menu, and as such unable to offer the Strawberry Ice Box Pie while also admitting that breakfast pastries are currently brought in from an outside source, the meal conclude with a duo of Bread Pudding and Turtle Pie, the former a dense block of brioche swimming in bourbon infused sauce beneath slowly melting ice cream while the later was an absolute must-order for those fancying caramel or chocolate, the filling a spot-on rendition of the inspirational candy with a graham cracker crust crisp too the tooth and heavy with spice.Already rivaling anything downtown for 24-hour fare, and only likely to get better with time, Siegel's 1941 is the sort of retro-rebrand that places such Roxy's at the Stratosphere have long aspired to emulate - a place where tourists and locals alike can get a good meal at a fair price, all while experiencing the old-school Vegas vibe that flows throughout its longest continuously running hotel and gaming space.Ahhhh, Vegas.While playing some video poker and waiting for some friends to arrive at the El Cortez bar, I noticed an advertisement for their restaurant, Siegel's 1941. The deal being offered was Las Vegas at its finest and I couldn't get it out of my mind. Starting at 11pm you can grab yourself an El Cortez burger and a beer for $6.00. My interest was peaked and you can bet your big ol' butt that I was in the half empty restaurant, waiting to be seated and hungry as all hell at a few minutes past 11pm. Okay, the service is horrid. One waitress, spread super thin, completely frustrated and ready to clock out... for life. She puts a lot of trust that the menu does a good enough job explaining the food because when she's at your table, she's all biz, no chit-chat. Thankfully I was already prepped and primed for the burger/beer special, which was not listed anywhere inside of the restaurant but verified to actually exist. I ordered mine cooked medium with a ice cold PBR to wash it all down. Twenty minutes later an impressive looking burger surfaced and I was quick to dig in. Where's the salt? Where's the pepper? Sure it was cooked to the perfect temperature and looked pretty, but damn, where's the flavor? A little seasoning could have bumped this burger up a few levels seeing as all of the other components were pretty decent. Hey, for $6.00 I'll still chalk this one up as a win.I had heard some good things about this fairly new rendition of the dining premises at the El Cortez Hotel that had formerly been The Flame, and finally visited to find out for myself.  While less upscale than its predecessor, the decor is still classy and now mob-oriented, and the more casual menu is now the very embodiment of comfort food.A Gulf Shrimp Cocktail was quite tasty and the equal of this classic starter at many other fine restaurants in town.  And a bowl of Matzo Ball Soup was really hot and excellent.  After I began attacking this concoction, I was ambivalent about having ordered it at all, because--chockful of chicken, carrots, and celery--this dish was really more an entree than a preliminary adjunct to another main course.  In the midst of the steaming broth was a large, nice and fluffy Matzo Ball, but the soup also came with Challah (Jewish home-baked bread) that was unfortunately dry and did not taste at all fresh.  A House Salad tasted good, and a generous portion of Country Fried Steak with Mashed Potatoes and Country Gravy was delectable and comforting.  All others at my table liked their ordered food as well.The decor, with big blowups of Bugsy on walls, was pleasant and somewhat historical.  And, while our waitress was rather stern and slow, our busboy provided good service.     I will be back soon to try other tempting offerings!

Review Text :
"Make-it-yourself and we'll bake it in seconds!" pizza spots are popping up everywhere. This is a version I actually enjoyed! Crisp, chewy crust with a variety of quality toppings (goat cheese, gorgonzola, fresh basil, minced garlic), ready super-fast with great service, for a low price (under $8/each) and sized large enough to have a couple of pieces leftover.On opening day, they were super busy but every employee was peppy and positive. In addition to the pizzas, they also have some small salads and desserts (ask for the s'mores to be heated in the oven!).  Highly recommend adding pesto drizzle to your creation after it bakes, a vibrant and flavorful version generously applied.I have been eyeing this place waiting for it to open and it finally has! Hubby and I stopped by for dinner a few days ago during the grand opening and a nice girl at the door gave us both BOGO coupons. There were a few tables occupied, but no long line like some of my friends faced when visiting during grand opening week. They have a good amount of tables inside and they also have some tables outside. After looking over the menu and placing my order, I watched the pizza artists work their magic making my pizza and I was impressed with the variety of toppings offered. Pizzas are made in 180 seconds once in the oven and are all $7.65 each plus tax and you can choose from one of their signature pizzas or build your own choosing the cheeses and toppings you like. I ended up liking my pizza a lot and came back for dinner tonight. Service was just as friendly and I again enjoyed my pizza. Build Your Own - I chose classic red sauce, shredded mozzarella, ovalini mozzarella, cherry tomatoes, mushrooms and pineapples. The sauce was good as the toppings. I really liked the thin crust that was chewy yet perfectly crisp.Art Lover - This is one of their signature pizzas with artichokes, mozzarella, ricotta, chopped garlic and red sauce dollops. The crust was consistent with my previous visit and I again enjoyed my pizza. The only problem with this pizza for me was that I tasted no garlic. It's possible it was forgotten when the pizza was being made, but garlic is a flavor that stands out and it was hiding this time, boo! You can get your food to-go like I did and you can also place your order online. I'm a fan and will be back to try other pizza creations :)I came during the opening and was given some buy one get one free coupons. The pizzas are around $8 and you get unlimited toppings. The toppings all looked fresh and they have a hell of a lot to choose from. I got the spicy sauce on my first visit and it wasn't very spicy but I liked it. The crust is super thin but crisp and the amount of toppings I had didn't weigh the pizza down or make it soggy after cooking. When I came back the last time I had the regular sauce and a couple different cheeses than the last time and it was very good. Workers were friendly and upbeat though they could turn the music down it was too loud. They have tables also outside where you can eat.

Holy Greek salad goodness, Spartan knows how to make a MEAN Greek salad! And that says a lot coming from me, i've had just about every Greek salad in the Valley! :) The veggies are SO fresh, chicken kabobs were grilled to perfection and the homemade vinaigrette dressing was light and perfect. We also got their "Greek Poutine" which was a bowl layered with french fries, feta cheese, Greek green beans w/red sauce (a Greek tomato sauce) and topped with feta again. I could literally eat these all day, every day, they were SO good! My boyfriend had the Gyro Cheesesteak and was raving about it the entire time that he was eating it. I had a bite and oh my goodness, it really was amazing. If you're looking for a quick, easy, fresh, and delicious lunch or dinner spot. This is your place!!!!I love having another Greek option in the 'hood...Spartan is a tiny little gem located on Thomas just East of 44th St, which makes it convenient for anyone who frequents the Target / Costco shopping center across the street.  I've now been a few times for take-out and while it hasn't disappointed, it's not somewhere I'd drive out of my way for either.  That being said, if you are close by and craving a Gyro, Souvlaki, or Greek Salad, this is your place!I've had both the Greek Salad with chicken and the Chopped Salad with chicken.  If you like dill, go for the Chopped!  You can't go wrong with the french fries or gyros either...Ingredients are fresh, service is friendly and speedy, and the prices are right.

Review Text :
i was really excited to have a tropical smoothie location closer to my home, but this location BY FAR is the worst. extremely understaffed & lacking in customer service. I have only visited a handful of times hoping that each experience might be a littler better, but i'm always left disappointed. food & smoothies arent to satisfaction, i ordered a wrap & there was HARDLY anything in it. it resembled a small taco! I waited approx 35 mins & all I ordered was a smoothie & a wrap. the customers AFTER me even got their food first!I feel for the one or two workers that i usually see that are alone busting their butts because they are working alone, manning EVERY single area of the store. I will not be visiting this location again, until there is better service & more employees. this is a new store, you're supposed to attract customers, not push them away. horrible!

Queue Taylor Swift!She wears short skirts,I eat pizza.She's cheer captainand I'm still eating pizza!*ahem*  So MOD Pizza seems to be everybody's sweetheart so I wanted to give this place a go!  Not bad, MOD, not bad.  The crust is thin and crispy and the toppings are delish.  The workers still seem to be new and some of those pizza artists had to peek at the sign to see what goes on each pizza.  I got a half-and-half on tonight's pie --- half Caspian and half "Squad Fave," Valencia.  I tweaked a bit on my Caspian and added some pepperoni and pineapples because I'm just the kinda gal that enjoys pineapples!  It was great.  I washed my pie down with their caramelized pea iced tea --- refreshing and not too sweet!Since this place is still new, everything is nice and clean.  There was a non-stop line the whole time we dined in so they must be doing something right.   With a lot of dining options nearby in this excellent strip plaza, this is the pizza joint of choice.While I'm not willing to replace my other pizza-made-my-way hot spot with MOD, this place is closer to home.Think Chipotle for Pizza! You order the size of pizza that you want and can add anything that you want to it, but the price remains the same. I LOVE that because if I had my way, I would have 10 toppings on my pizza every time! I loved that they had crumbled meatballs as a topping. They also have wine and beer on tap and a large, open patio that is perfect for this time of year! The pizza dough was cooked to bubbly perfection in a pizza oven. Since it is right around the corner from my house, i'll be back soon!It's okay.  It's the current fad in pizza concepts, where you pay one price and you can put anything you want on the pie.  It's been done.  MOD does it too.  The only real criticism I have is the crust.  I dunno.  tastes like cardboard to me.  But they do have great local microbrews on tap.  Sorta makes you forget the crust.

I wasn't going to order thanks to the 1st review but I am glad I tried it after all. The orange chicken was crispy and sooooo good and the portion size was more than enough!The chicken broccoli was good as well, lots of chicken and veggies. Orange chicken is my favorite so far. My husband and I will definitely be ordering again! Finally good Chinese food that delivers! Chen wok is disgusting!

Brightly lit by natural lighting, impressive tall ceilings, and a beautifully designed space, when you step in, you will find a remarkable english tea room with the allure of modern coffee shop that will certainly charm you!The eclectic mix of glazed plywood counters, industrial tables, architects folding lights, wooden & steel draft stools, antique piano, buttoned chairs and tungsten lighting somehow all work well together. In addition to the esthetically pleasing surroundings, a lot of attention was paid to functionality including the availabilities of many conveniently located power outlets where you can plug and charge your laptop or mobile devices. The only odd thing about this place are the paintings - slightly disconnected.I did stop by for a quick brew, made from Kittel coffee beans, which was okay but was served in unique looking jade like mugs. I also couldn't help noticing the homemade sweet and savory creations that came out of this tiny but well equipped kitchen (induction cooktops, mini convection oven, euro size dishwasher...). Everything is made on the spot except for the bread and croissants that come from Guillaume, a fabulous local bakery. This place is barely two months old and will continue to evolve. I'll definitely have to return to indulge in some of the cooking and the unavoidable and time-honored ritual of afternoon tea, complete with silver teapot, fine china, crustless cucumber sandwiches, and Yorkshire pudding -- all at an affordable price of 27$ for two -- amazing!One question remains though: why is this place named "La Brume dans Mes Lunettes" - is it because the fog that builds up on eyeglasses when drinking a cup of coffee, is it because of the windows that steam up on chilly fall and winter days, or is it remnants memories of tormented past love stories that still linger?

Wow! I am not a vegetarian in the slightest but popped over for a meal as I work nearby. I actually went 3 days in a row and I now might have a problem. Actually booked the restaurant out for my wife's birthday :-).The fresh made to order pizzas are incredible. Amazing amazing amazing.Had a chat with the gent who opened the restaurant and he's been working in Edinburgh restaurants a while and decided to pursue his passion of his own restaurant.So if you're looking for an amazing pizza (Quattro Formaggi for me) check this place out! Authentic Italian, with lots of love and passion in the service a food! Have to say it. Best pizza in Edinburgh!

Review Text :
What a great izakaya-style spot! This plaza is rife with great offerings, and I'm glad to see the new dishes offered here: a mix of hot and cold tapas, with some sashimi and yakitori grill items thrown in. Their charcoal grill items are featured, but their fresh fish items are standouts for us!HOT DISHESThe grilled ika and grilled mackerel are both great! Nice blistering, perfectly cooked, simple and tasty. Daikon, lemon, and spicy mayo are offered alongside, but neither dish really needs it.  The chicken karrage was juicy, but not a standout. Crispy breading seemed uneven. COLD DISHESThe sashimi roll is perfection: fresh fish, rice paper, and shiso leaves, with a tasty yuzu sauce. The sashimi carpaccio features garlic oil, herbs, and seasonings- the crispy garlic in particular added great texture and flavor to the fish! What's not to love?! I am hoping they add more raw fish dishes and light rolls to their menu, their fish is very fresh and great quality. Will come back for sashimi. GRILL ITEMSVarious meats on sticks. The chicken thigh is tasty, with a nice char to it. They have a house-made chicken sausage that is fairly unique, and available with a poached egg dipping sauce- didn't much care for it. The offer two types of beef tongue, and the lean version we tried lacked the flavor we expected, seeming more like liver? The kurobata sausage and tomato/bacon are staples that are executed well. Grilled mackerel was the best dish in this section of the menu: simply prepared, crispy skin, moist interior, best with just a squeeze of lemon.DESSERTMatcha pannacotta is sublime. Cool, creamy green tea custard features a surprise red bean filling, topped with a dollop of fresh whipped cream. I prefer desserts that aren't too sweet, and this perfectly fit the bill. Their honey toast seems to be very popular though, and many groups around us ordered it.Service sitting at the sushi bar was attentive throughout our visit, with constant drink refills and small talk with the sushi chef. The interior space is modern, with both booths and the bar, and loud EDM/House style music, which was an interesting contrast to the simple, classic food. Looking forward to coming back!Owner of Ramen Sora and Sushi Twister now opened up an izakaya on Jones/Spring Mountain. They specialize in hand grilled yakitori (Japanese style skewered chicken) which is cooked over Binchotan charcoal.AMBIANCE/SERVICEClassy elegant feel with loud pop music playing. Sushi bar counter sits in the center of the restaurant, with tables around which are sectioned off. Cool layout but chairs at the sushi bar was extremely uncomfortable. Neat that they have a purse hook under the table. Courteous and attentive servers here. Attention to detail/knowledge of menu were on point. FOODNot much of a variety or selection in my opinion. If anything, I would stick to their yakitori. According to their description, Hachi uses a high quality Binchotan charcoal which release large quantities of infrared rays, therefore making the meat crispy on the outside and tender/juicy on the inside. Yakitori Bowl-It's really a mini yakitori bowl. I would say it is the same size as the mini chasyu bowl you can get over at Ramen Sora. Yakitori was super tender but had a very light flavor. 3/5Pork with Negi Shio Sauce-pork belly was so juicy. I also liked the negi shio sauce. 4/5Umeshiso Yaki-I know Ichiza has a pork skewer with umeshiso which is exactly like this. This one is chicken and I must say I liked the umeshiso skewer here better. Stronger ume flavor and more shiso leaves. 5/5Matcha Panacotta-creamy green tea/matcha custard with red bean filling. I like the matcha panacotta at Sakana better but I still enjoyed this. 4/5CONCLUSIONEach dish was tiny and I personally think its overpriced. Food here was underwhelming but exceptional service here will round up my rating to 3 stars.Hachi is one of the latest izakayas to open up shop, taking up residence along the popular corners of Jones and Spring Mountain.  With ramen (Ramen Sora) and AYCE sushi (Sushi Twister) under their belts, the owners went a different route with their newest venture in yakitori. Greeted promptly and eagerly on a recent Sunday evening, the restaurant was a third full with Japanese-speaking clientele. Our waiter was thorough and energetic with explaining the menu and there was a bit to review.  We ordered a little of everything, but let's get to my favorites first. * Crispy Chips "Deep fried chicken skin chips with house seasoning" ($3) - Oh. My. Gawd. This had me dancing in my seat! Fresh off the fryer with a squeeze of lemon and I am having a party in my mouth. I love deep fried chicken skin and their version just makes me so happy. As a result, we added 2 more orders. Love love love! * Yamaimo Chips "Japanese mountain yam skin fried isobe style" ($3) - Having only experienced this dish at one other place, we were psyched to see it here. Yum. Yum. Yum. Can I get an Amen? Oh yeah! There's a limit of 3 orders a day since they don't carry a huge quantity of mountain yams. We were more than happy to claim all 3 for ourselves.* Ika Karaage "Deep fried squid" ($3.50) - A tasty aioli accompanied this dish.* Skipjack Tataki Hachi Style ($6.50) - This dish came from their specials board. It's loaded with raw red onions, which may not be something for everyone. I especially liked the shiso leaf, onions, and mayo(?) combination, but it was a little too heavy-handed with the Hachi sauce.* Assorted Sashimi Bowl ($9.98) - This came with about 10 pieces of fresh fish on top of rice. It didn't taste like sushi rice and I didn't expect it to be since they don't serve any nigiri here from what I gathered. This is a great opportunity to use their special soy sauce blend made with bonito flakes, so it's a bit sweeter.* Scallop Carpaccio "Scallop sashimi topped with masago, cherry tomatoes, micro cilantro and micro greens. Splashed with olive oil, white soy sauce, lemon yuzu, and yuzu miso sauce." ($9.95) - The scallop was fresh and bright, and the fish eggs were flavorful (although they seemed more like tobiko than masago). I wasn't the hugest fan of the micro cilantro and micro greens and felt the yuzu miso sauce took away from the clean flavors of the seafood.* Halibut and Sea Urchin Carpaccio "Thinly sliced halibut topped with seared sea urchin, green onion, momiji oroshi and yuzu ponzu." ($12.50) - Although delicately presently, it lacked something. The flavors weren't coming out as much as we would have hoped for this dish.* Tsukune with Oroshi Ponzu ($3.50) - It's made with ground pork and was surprisingly quite juicy. Their yakitori does take awhile, so I suggest putting those orders in early. They use Binchotan charcoal (versus a gas grill or regular charcoal), which means the food grills at a lower temperature for a longer period of time. Be sure to utilize their condiments, specifically the Buta miso which is made from miso and crispy pork discards.* Otsumami 3 Kinds ($5) - We received bean sprouts, squid and seaweed, and bonito flakes and veggies. It was a little uninspiring. It does change regularly though. We tried ordering their Match soft serve, but it was unavailable. Overall, food was good. I would come back just for the Crispy Chips and Yamaimo Chips for sure. I would request light sauce or sauce on the side for the sashimi dishes, but that's my preference. I would definitely be interested to see what other specials they offer and any additions to their current menu. Service was attentive and polite. Water glasses were constantly filled and they worked as a team checking up on us. Love that.Note: They do use peanuts as their chopstick holders, so those with severe peanut allergies should be aware!Items Selected:Tamago Omelet - GingerCrispy Chicken SkinGarlic EdamameShiitake Butter - Shiitake Mushroom with butter & soy sauceYamaimo Chips - Japanese Mountain Yam Skin fried with Isobe StyleIkayaki - Spicy MayoJuicy Chicken Karaage - Deep Fried Chicken thigh with house special negi sauceGround TsukuneCheese Chikuwa Tempura - Mozzarella cheese wrapped with fish cake and deep fried with tempuraPork Belly TareTeppan Beef Tongue - Tomatoes and Bean SproutsKurobuta Sausage - Ketchup and Mustard, SalsaAppetizer Trio - Eggplant Mustard, Tuna with Seaweed and Miso, Arugula NegiMatcha Panna Cotta - Red BeanHoney Toast - Vanilla Ice CreamLocated on Jones, in the same plaza as China Mama and Chada Thai, Hachi is a relative newcomer to the growing izakaya scene in Las Vegas' Chinatown and owned by the team behind acclaimed Ramen Sora it was with two friends and a four year old that dinner was enjoyed this past Saturday, the results a bit mixed but at times more impressive than Raku at a lower pricepoint and far less of a hassle.Spacious in layout, a center bar welcoming solos and those looking to experience a limited selection of raw fish cut to order, it was at one of the comfortable booths circling the restaurant perimeter that our group was sat and with service always nearby, pleasant, and happy to answer questions it was after a brief description of daily specials that a bakers-dozen items were selected, several ordered in duplicate with the total bill tallying just under $30 per person.Unfortunately one of those places to which "coursing out" plates is a foreign concept, despite several requests not to overwhelm the table, it was with a relatively limp and flavorless presentation of chilled omelet that the meal kicked off, but following this up almost immediately with two styles of fried crisps both the chicken skins and house-special mountain yam were lightly seasoned and virtually oilless, the first bold bit of flavor presented by garlic soaked edamame that permeated the air in a ten foot radius.Underwhelming again with buttered mushrooms that were tender enough, though not particularly well displayed beneath too much salt, it was with the whole squid that grilled items began to arrive, the tenderness of the cephalopod's flesh found beneath snappy initial resistance as a kiss of charred lemon added 'pop' with or without the spicy mayo addition.Surprised by the thickness of fried chicken thigh that was both tender and immensely juicy on a plate of  miso sauce imbued with smoke and onions the evening's most intriguing bite was soon offered by "Cheese Chikuwa Tempura," the thinly rolled fish layer not dissimilar to the flavor of salt-cod beneath light batter with a gooey mozzarella interior.Progressing to three items from the low temperature binchotan grill, all 'Out-Rakuing' Raku in terms of smoke profile and tenderness with the ground pork Tsukune particularly memorable amongst the group, it was with a bit less enthusiasm that the daily appetizer trio hit out table - the raw tuna well flavored while the rest were mostly throwaways, the daily special beef tongue marred by being overcooked by tableside searing, a Bill Walton quote-in-waiting about "letting the show get in the way of the game."Saddening the little fella at the table by informing us that softserve was unavailable it was nonetheless in two desserts that the evening called it an end and although the bittersweet panna cotta with an unexpected red bean core was a bit meager in portion considering the $6 pricetag, the $7.98 Honey Toast more than made up for it as the half-loaf was presented golden, buttery, and crisp yet at the same time still saturated with sweetness.***Excelling with some items while fumbling and frustrating with others that seemed slipshod in their execution despite otherwise good ingredients and intentions, Hachi is the sort of place where a good meal can be had at a relatively low investment while a more memorable overall experience would be better sought at Raku for those interested in esoterica or Kyara at a similar cost.

Review Text :
Fish, wings, chicken, and shrimp pretty much sums it up. The choices for fish are Tilapia and catfish. They have traditional or boneless wings, Jumbo fried shrimp, fried chicken, and chicken nuggets. They do serve a variety of different appetizers and side dishes to go with the meals. Now for my 2 star rating...I originally ordered Catfish nuggets. When my meal came out they brought me a whole catfish. I looked at my receipt and showed them I wanted the nuggets. They took the food away and began making what I ordered. Mind you the food is made to order and took about 15 minutes to make in the first place so now I have to wait another 10 minutes for them to remake my meal. When the food finally arrived they brought me my food and told me the have me a few extra nuggets. I thought that was a nice gesture but they let the same sides they had given me before on my place so it was not fresh and it was cold. I ate the catfish nuggets expecting it to satisfy the hunger pains since I had waited so long for my food to come out. What a disappointment. The fish was so bland, no flavor, no seasoning and smelled like it was fresh out the ocean. Beware of the fish I would not recommend. I was with 2 other people and 1 order chicken nuggets which were pretty good. We had to ask for sauce because they never asked us.  My other friend order jumbo shrimp. He loved the shrimp. This was probably the best thing out of everything that we ordered. It came with fries but the fries didn't have any salt on them and tasted like they were cooked in bad grease. The baked beans were hard and dried out like they had been reheated in the microwave several times. It's too bad this place didn't work out I was excited to see a new restaurant to try.  I will not be going back.

Review Text :
Maybe it was just the word Gangnam made me want to come here because it reminded me of that song. So this place is a Japanese/Korean restaurant. I heard the sushi was good and the Korean food was good so I tried it. I liked it. I will have to say that the Korean stuff is more the pricey side while the Japanese food is about what you would find elsewhere.I ordered sushi and Korean food. The sushi was good. The Korean tofu soup was even better. It had a lot of flavor and way more than the usual ones I find at other Korean restaurant. One thing about the staff is that they are so happy. Why are they so happy? I don't know. But they were happy and enthusiastic. If only they weren't so new and forgetful of things that you request.Well food and service was good and the decor was very intimate so I say it's good place to bring friends and dates! There's very few Korean places in Tempe so this place is definitely a plus to the area.(Lyrics - Psy - Gangnam Style)Oppan Gangnam SushiGangnam SushiOp op op op oppan Gangnam SushiGangnam SushiOp op op op oppan Gangnam SushiEh......Sushi & GrillOp op op op oppan Gangnam SushiEh......Sushi & GrillOp Op Op Op Eh Eh Eh Eh Eh EhOkay, with a name like that what song did you expect me to make a parody with......?I was a skeptic about this place, but being a New & Hot spot on my Yelp app....why not!?The place is not in the best location for a restaurant in my opinion.  I came here with a birthday dinner party.  Service wise I think they could improve; slow and inexperience.  I gather it's a new place and still might be getting it's kinks together however that's not an excuse I can forgive.  For our food we ordered the mackerel fish, Tiger & Spicy Tuna sushi, and the Bibimbap with Bulgogi.  The mackerel was cooked just right!  Salty to the bite and still retaining it's moisture; probably my favorite of the night!  Our Bibimbap was good, but I thought it was lacking in Bulgogi beef; probably another ounce or 2 of beef would have been welcoming.  I'm not a sushi snob but overall I thought the sushi was well plated and tasty.  I always enjoy a spicy and crunchy roll with some exotic ingredients.  Thus, we ordered the Tiger roll that included the Spider Crabs.  In the end, the 2 of us were pretty full and couldn't finish our meals.Overall, I thought the food very good and finish what I could.  Not a lot of drink specials, but no complaints.  However, I was surprised at the price they were charging for some items which I could have ordered at other places for probably $1-$3 cheaper. - Enjoy!

Review Text :
Mala is a new Szechuan place, specializing in more traditional dishes, with a small selection of dim sum items. I stuck to appetizers and smaller tapas-style bites on my first visit but was pleased with the quality and service.BABY WON TONS IN HOT CHILI OIL: The best! Tiny, delicate pouches with a pinch of filling, swimming in a fantastic chili oil with bits of garlic. This was my favorite dish, and one I'll be coming back for.FISH ROLLS: Skinny rolls filled with fish and cilantro, wrapped in crispy won ton skins, reminded me of a fresh take on lamb cigars in Mediterranean cuisine. These were simple but good.WOODEAR MUSHROOMS: BF picked this dish, and he liked it. I did not care for the jellied texture of the mushrooms. These were seasoned with a slightly-spicy sauce and a lot of lemongrass. CRISPY SHRIMP IN GARLIC OIL: Five crispy shrimp,  with a savory chopped mushroom topping, nicely cooked. I did not care for the "garlic oil", as it did not have much flavor and lent the dish a greasy feel. PORK AND SHRIMP SHUMAI: These were served in the steamer baskets, and had thicker skins than I am used to. The dipping sauce was a bit bland, but the filling was generous and balanced. Throughout our meal, service was attentive and polite. They are still in the grand opening stage until the end of the month, and have several promising-looking entrees and hotpot dishes.Only a month new this restaurant is outside of the Chinatown area but has convenient parking which is shared with the business next store. The establishment specializes in spicy Szechwan entrees and the interior is decorated tastefully. I started off with a cup of wonton soup and followed with the seafood  hot pot which was loaded with fish, shrimp, calamari and veggies. The hotpot was so large I couldn't finish the entree but was satisfing. I'll be returning here next time I'm in town and try a lamb or a spicy dish.

I love a good lobster roll with a side of Benadryl. I was excited when I first heard a buzz about a new place that serves lobster rolls opening up, Luke's Lobster. The food is tasty and comes out pretty quick. The menu is simple. They have shrimp, crab, lobster, clam chowder, lobster bisque, original potato chips, and salt and vinegar chips. Lobster Bisque:Chunky pieces of lobster. The bisque is creamy and delicious. 4/5Lobster Roll:Pretty generous portions of cold lobster on a buttery roll. 4/5Price is standard for lobster rolls. The only thing is since this is located in an open space outside Fashion Show Mall, you're subject to extreme Vegas temperatures: cold winter nights and hot summer days. We froze the night we went.

Its take-out Tuesday again. What to eat? What to eat? A quick consultation with Yelp and it's decided to visit The Coronado. What a lovely place! Located less than a mile north of the artsy Roosevelt row and looks like one of those house-type cafes that I would like to live in. Not many seats and a menu small enough to fit on a 5x8 card, but the important thing is that they serve jackfruit. Yes, honey. Jackfruit - a special treat for folk who like variety in their vegetarian staples.3 jackfruit sliders puleeeze! They held the mayo for me and still the bitty sandwiches were moist. Purple cabbage was crisp. Bread was lightly dry-toasted and soft. Perfect amount of fries, fried with skin on and not overly salted.Will come again. Sho'nuff!

Review Text :
Queen City Beer and Chili does not disappoint!!  I had been waiting for this spot to open up for a while since I see it every time I'm in Brevard court grabbing lunch- glad to see it finally opened.Went here for lunch so I could not partake in the beer, but I will definitely be back- either to grab a couple pints or fill a growler up to take home.Love the concept.  The two chili dogs I had for lunch were spot on.  I went with the meal combo 3 which consists of two dogs, a side, and a drink.   They do not have many menu offerings but they make a strong showcase of their chili using various food vessels. My buddy got the nachos that were made of their house chips and a ton of toppings (added bacon for a dollar fidy).  Super reasonable prices for the food - seems like the more Charlotte grows the more expensive lunch uptown becomes.The right side of the place is where you order the food, you can either take it out or bring it into the bar area where they have about 6 tables- or sit at the bar!  Modern warm wood covers the entire space and there is exposed brick on the bar side (left side).  Edison bulbs win the growler shades adorn the ceilings and give the bar a pretty great relaxed atmosphere.Staff was super nice and made sure we were happy with how everything turned out.  I definitely will be back to partake in the 20 beers they have on tap.

Nice big fat dog with some interesting selections.  Ordered a "Signature Frank" - BLT which was very good, with bacon, mixed greens, tomato and chipotle ranch.  The "Frank " was very good and enjoyed the toppings.  The menu also has a few salads, a few poutines and other sides.  We shared a Quebecoise Poutine that was OK, the fries were good but the gravy was a little cold and just not as good as I was expecting.We did not have any beer, but there were a list of 9 beers on tap.

Review Text :
The Skinny: delicious pan fried pork and cabbage dumplings which squirt juice in your mouth! The stir-fried dishes we ordered was good as well(4) service is excellent! (5) value: pretty good for a fast casual joint. (4.5 stars).FYI, this restaurant is tucked away in the same Plaza as the Smith's across from i-naba. Okay. I'll be honest. I was a bit skeptical with all the Crab Rangoon,  moo goo gai pan, Sesame chicken on the menu. But I must admit,  underneath it all? This place has some legit Chinese food.First of all,  their dumplings are not listed on their regular menu. They have basa fish,  vegetarian, and pork with Napa cabbage. You have 3 styles -  in soup,  steamed and pan-fried. All made in house and 8 dumplings will set you back $6.95.The pork and cabbage dumplings pan fried were our starters and boy, are they good! Literally the juice from the vegetables and pork squirt into your mouth as you bite into them. The wrapper was not too thick to detract from the filling inside. Delicious and tasted just like the ones we make at home. The basa fish dumplings (with leeks and ginger) we tried were also very good which we tried in soup. The flavor of the soup was okay but the main attraction,  the dumplings,  were pretty flavorful. We tried the braised tofu dish and the steamed eggplant with garlic ($8.50 each). The hubs loved the braised tofu. We appreciated the fact the dish had good wok hai and was not overly sauced like most Chinese joints. (Good Chinese stir-fried dishes should not be sitting in goopy sauce. End of story.) The water chestnuts were a bit weird for me but other than that the dish was well constructed and tasted great. I really liked the steamed eggplant dish with garlic. I never thought to just steam it like fish and serve it with soy sauce. It eliminates the amount of oil normally used to cook eggplant and tastes much healthier. The eggplant texture was pillowy soft and fabulous. Will have to try this at home. We also received two free smoothies per the Yelp check in promotion they have. The hubs got the green tea while I got the black sesame. Both were good but really for me the dumplings/food are the bigger attraction. Service was excellent,  friendly and attentive. The restaurant is clean and spacious, making it good for families. FYI, Monday to Friday, they do have lunch specials featuring Chinese American type food for $7.95 and set menus as well. As a more casual restaurant,  they do not have a large extensive menu like other Chinese restaurants do. However of what they do have, they execute very well. In reality, the thing that excites me about this place are the more traditional dishes they have here. Will definitely be back for more dumplings and to try other dishes. 4.5 starred review.Delicious, divine dumplings with perfect skins, tons of filling, and a great price. At $7/8-piece order, available in three varieties and three cooks (pan-fried, in soup, or steamed), they are easily the highlight here. The basa fish variety with leeks and ginger are subtle but better steamed than in the soup, which I found bland. The pork and cabbage is best pan-fried to juicy, textured perfection.But dumplings aren't all they do well here, the more traditional Chinese dishes are also a success. The half roast duck is a generous portion, with a lightly crisped skin and moist, flavorful meat, complemented by a thick, sweet house-made sauce. Lighten up your meal with a side of the garlic eggplant or Chinese broccoli. Will be coming back for garlic spinach, mapa tofu, and Chinese seafood gumbo (the dumplings are a given).If the food isn't enough to draw you in, this is also a solid place to snag a smoothie or boba: they have 100 options to pick from, and you get a free small on your first visit with Yelp check in! The specialty options with multiple fruits sound to be the best, they even feature an avocado-black sesame version.Do I need a reason to be cheerful? Absolutely not. But then comes along a business that makes me want to be more cheerful than I already am, and that place is Cheerful House Chinese Cuisine.What should I cheer on first? How about the hometown team aka the dumpling? Ok I'll start with that. Big, tasty dumplings. Ones that make you go "mmm mmm mmmm". They make pork ones, fish ones, and shrimpy ones. You know I'm all about that. And then some. And you get a choice. Choices are wonderful. Pan fried, steamed, or in soup form. Try 'em all. You know I did. Which one is the bestest? That's up for you to decide. I'm keepin it on the rizzle this time, so I'll go pan fried. They got some bubble tea dranks. I liked em, not too sweet for some of em. Chewy balls. Not too shabby. Shabbalicioso. To the max. Max Payne. In the membrane.Other then the dumpleroonies, they serve the usuals that you would normally see in a Chinese resto. But I gotta admit, it's hella lotta betta than most places. Had a ton of fun with the chow fun. It was good enough to make a nun run to the sun. No pun intended. Note: the mapo tofu is more soy based here than chili based you would normally find, but hey, it was good so I is are not complaining. You know what I mean, you know what I'm sayin, kid. Like it, good value and portions. Fits my palate, that's all I care about. JT says "it's gonna be maaay", all about them dumplings.

This is one of the newest restaurants in the Summerlin area.  Their concept is good and very interesting. You can select your pasta and the sauce you want. Their pasta is homemade authentic italian. You have about 10 different pasta options to select from. And over 20 different sauces... They have it all! The portions size are very generous, you will for sure have left overs! I went over for lunch and they had a lunch special of pasta and a sauce plus and drink for 9.99. However, the offer is a bit deceiving because you can only pick two or three sauces for lunch. The rest of the menu was full price.  So at the end we spent about 15 each, which sounds a bit much for a lunch entree. Especially when you can go to olive garden and have all you can eat pasta and salad for 7.99. The flavors were good, but nothing memorable.I'll be the first to say it: when I drove by, pulled up the rave reviews, and visited their website, I kind of scoffed at their claims of fresh-made pasta and sauces. Noodles & Co has been doing this for years, and we already have Mac Shack as a local version- same concept for all.But my dinner here was really pretty great- I dig the modern kitchen decor, and the service is charming with a prominent Italian accent and genuine warmth. You pick from a variety of pastas and sauces, and add on apps, salads, soups, and/or desserts if you so desire. Note that pastas and sauces/toppings are priced separately, so this can add up- it's no bottomless Olive Garden bargain. The mushroom ravioli ($5) was a generous portion of large, lightly-stuffed pillows. I opted for the pesto gorgonzola ($9), which was creamier than expected and quite rich. I would love to see them add a regular, robust pesto to the menu rather than just the cheesed version.Was a bit disappointed with the caprese salad ($11)- the tomatoes were underripe and flavorless, which didn't rise to the level of the the fresh mozzarella, basil, and other vegetables. I realize they're new, but until they can get a supplier who can provide fresh, ripe tomatoes, perhaps this should be sidelined or only featured as a special.Split the pasta and salad for a large dinner, gave the rest to my guy- along with the complimentary bruschetta that comes with each order. Giant amount of food, total was just under $30, with tip. NOTE: The lunch "specials" offer very limited, basic selection. Hopefully they will expand what is covered in this category. I currently cannot recommend it as a lunch spot, despite working nearby.

I love Born and Raised, for the simple facts that it's a sports bar, but doesn't feel or look like one. It has some style, great food, and no cheesy neon beer lights all over the place. The layout is like a orange 70's style living room with a massive wall of TVs, a fully equipped bar, and random seats for lounging and socializing. You can also get a portable speaker placed on your table with any game you want blasting out the play by play. I was here during breakfast, but wanted lunch so I went with chorizo quesadilla and split some Guinness Bratwurst Bites, which are bratwurst baked in puff pastry and served brown mustard. Obviously, I was going for super healthy lunch here. 'The Guinness Bites were good, but I felt like the Guinness gave them a flavor that I wasn't super stoked on, but the Chorizo quesadilla was piece of greasy spicy heaven. I probably could have eaten two orders of these. I also tried my fiancée's order which was a basic, "Bar Breakfast" ham, 3 eggs, potatoes, toast, served with a side of smashed red potatoes. Everything was very good and the mashed potatoes were a great retreat from the normal hash browns.    Like I stated the food is great, love the laid back vibe and the service is solid. I only wish they wouldn't allow smoking inside, I really f*cking hate that shit.  I will be back to try the, "Hendertucky Toast". French Toast with Fruity Pebbles, yabba dabba doo!Early this week my Yelp Friend Robert W received an ROTD (Review Of The Day) for this Born & Raised (B.A.R.) Henderson location and it seemed like the perfect place to enjoy watching the football game together. Last night we did just that! In the process of waiting for Thursday 5:30pm kickoff, I thought it would be fun to invite some others. For starters, one of my best friends had no plans and it was his birthday...so naturally I thought the more the merrier and sent out some Yelp Friend invites. Over a dozen Yelpers + 1s showed up last night to enjoy many tasty foods & intoxicating drinks, fun conversations & much laughter, along with watching the Cardinals beat the Vikings on a giant wall TV.Most of us sat in the "living room" area at a couple large tables we secured prior to kickoff. Others wandered off to the next room and bar area where there are more TVs, video poker, etc. The decor at Born & Raised is very hip and the overall vibe of this place is extremely comfortable. Although I did not take food photos, others in our unofficially unofficial Yelp party did. (see the photos section). We tried many of the 20 appetizers, sliders, beers, birthday shots, drinks, etc that accumulated to over $400 dollars. My favorite was their Buffalo hot chicken wings, taquito's and garlic pretzel bites.Our very friendly and attentive server named Channels was fantastic, and certainly deserved the generous tip we gave her at the end of the night. In fact, all of the staff here worked together well as a team and really showed interest in top notch service for all patrons.Next time I visit Born & Raised, I will probably try the "Challenge" seen at the bottom of their menu...to eat 15 sliders + 1 lb of Anchor Fries in under 1 hour. The prize is a B.A.R t-shirt and comped meal. I eat a ton and think I can do it, as the alternative is pay up $75 bucks! Look forward to returning again soon...See 2 photos below...YELP 300 CHALLENGE 2015: #297

This place is located in boca park and there's never a long wait. This place is nice and quiet. They have an all you can eat for around 25 dollars per person! They're selection is good and they have many yummy rolls to choose from!!!They may have changed the sign out front, but it's still Tokyoto Sushi- same staff and chefs, same menu. Instead of AYCE, I usually opt for a la carte or lunch specials- the lettuce wrap app is as close to a riceless roll as you'll get here, but they do allow you to order handrolls sans rice, for an additional $1 each.Lunch specials are on a separate menu. Even going during lunch, this menu is not provided upon seating. It's also not provided when you ask for it. I had to pull up their website menu on my phone before they brought over the lunch sushi combos list so I could order- kind of irritating. Other than that and forgetting my beverage for the duration of my visit, service was polite.The lunch combo #3 is my favorite: miso soup and two gyoza, plus your choice of two special rolls from a limited list. The given options are just okay, most of them are shrimp tempura rolls. The namesake OMy roll and the Aladdin roll are both fairly plain, and the rice fell apart where sauces were used.

I love the sandwiches at the Firehouse Subs in Chandler so I had to check out the location in Tempe. We ordered a large size NY steamer. It was a huge size, easily shared between two people. The bread was soft with toasted edges, the meat, cheese and onions were a good portion and well balanced. The shelf to the side has a wide array of hot sauces which are labeled in levels of spiciness from 1-10. I also love the Coca Cola Freestyle here which gives you he choice of making your own custom drink. They even have holiday flavors now! Service was excellent and the staff came by to check up on us to make sure we had a good experience. Overall a good place for a sandwich.

Review Text :
There are very few restaurants that truly merit a 1 star review. Most restaurants have a redeeming quality. If the service is poor, sometimes the food is cheap. If the portions are small or the food is bland, oftentimes the prices are low.Eastwind has no redeeming qualities. 1 star across the board.Service: They have an awkward "half service" policy where you order at the counter and have your food delivered to your table and taken away when you leave it there after a few bites. Maybe there are some cultural norms I'm missing but the service is very abrupt. I was the only customer in the restaurant and after around 10 seconds of looking at the menu I was granted a scowling "What you want." Later she delivered food to the table without a word or a smile. I felt a sense of genuine antipathy, like she would have enjoyed stabbing me in the eye with one of their unwashed forks.Food: I ordered the Korean Beef platter. I read in a previous review that they failed some health inspections in January so I figured beef was safer than seafood. The plate sure looked delicious, but the first thing I noticed was that there was a paucity of beef and a plethora of noodles for a dish with "beef" in its name. Then I speared a chunk of beef and...ew. I'm a frugal shopper, so I frequently pick up 50% off "manager specials" at the grocery store for same day cooking. It's a risk, but typically you get a great deal on a perfectly good cut of beef. Occasionally I get unlucky though, so Im very familiar with the flavor of turned beef. The beef at Eastwind wasn't even manager's special plus a few days. It was plain rotten. It's the kind of beef that you find in a Cormac McCarthy novel that the protagonist, starving, downtrodden, maybe considering cannibalism, would still pass on. It's currently turning in my stomach. I hope I don't have to leave work early.Decor and setting:All the signs of a place slowly going to shit. Clearly this used to have owners that cared, it no longer does. The bathroom has that old piss smell you normally find in public bathrooms in a park, or back allies behind the dumpster at a dive bar. I used the urinal, it doesn't flush. Like I pulled the handle, and just nothing. I didn't wash my hands, because the sink looked like I probably would have picked up more germs than I would cleaned off. I doubt the new management has cleaned it once since taking over, and they're in dire need of a plumber. The menu is covered in blackouts and price changes, clear signs of a restaurant on the ropes and either too cheap or lazy to reprint. Christmas decor is still up, as is Thanksgiving decor.  Lightbulbs are out everywhere, and the equipment to change them sits in full view of customers gathering dust next to the fountain drinks. The kitchen is also in full view. When I was walking out I saw the chef messing with his cell phone, the cord resting on cutting board where my rotting meat was just cut.I had maybe ten bites, comes out to a dollar per bite. Left the rest in the table.This place is just the worst.Pros: literally nothingCons: literally everything

Review Text :
Really good burgers which must be compared to In N Out and Five Guys to give the right perspective.  I grew up in CA and instinctively am biased against Shake Shack in favor of In N Out so this review hurts a little.Quality of Meat: Shake Shack - In N Out - Five Guys (from best to worst)Shake Shack the easy winner here.  Juicy on the inside and cooked at high enough heat to get some charring on the outside.  A really solid patty you wouldn't have an issue with if you paid $15 at a steak house for(besides expecting a bigger patty).  Five Guys, to me, has the worst meat.  It's bland and cooked at lower heat so there's nothing happening on the outside.  In N Out has some charring but the patty is too thin and not juicy enough.Quality of Bun: Shake Shack - In N Out - Five GuysThe Shake Shack bun is awesome. Soft and pliable.  It lets you bite down into your burger without all the toppings flying everywhere.  That's a problem Five Guys in particular has and to a lesser extent In N Out.  In N Out does toast the buns....I couldn't tell if Shake Shack did but definitely didn't taste the toast like you do at In N Out.  Still.....have to go with the Shake Shack bun.  If they sold that bun in any supermarket it's what I would buy to take to a bbq for burgers.Quality of Toppings: Shake Shack - In N Out - Five GuysIn N Out has the best tomatoes, lettuce, and onions.  However, Shake Shack has bacon, superior grilled onions, and other toppings like peppers which give you much more variety.  Five Guys has the most options and they're free...but I've always found their toppings to be bland, poorly cooked, and just not good.  Fries: Shake Shack - Five Guys - In N OutWell seasoned crinkle cut fried over at Shake Shack.  NOT a good value by any means as you get an average portion at around $4.  That's insane pricing.  In N Out has pretty brutal fries IMO.  Five Guys gets silver on volume alone.  But fries are too big which means you have to put a ton of salt and/or ketchup.Cost: Shake Shack - Five Guys - In N Out (meaning Shake Shack is the most expensive option)Shake Shack is flat out expensive.  For a double cheeseburger they charge around $10 vs. $3.50 for In N Out and somewhere in between for Five Guys.  I don't know why anyone would eat at Five Guys with the prices they charge.  Five Guys does have an awesome soda machine at Downtown Summerlin.  If you're price sensitive, Shake Shack is gonna trigger you.TLDR; Shake Shack has really good burgers and fries.  But it's very expensive for what is essentially a fast food experience.Downtown Summerlin has been a bit lackluster with food options (all promise, with lack of delivery), so I'm happy to see this place open up and solidly perform both in quality of food and service. I went during their opening week and was glad that the line wasn't our the door long. Our wait time was expected after ordering (not too long though), but it did seem like a few other folks were wondering where their food orders were. Both the burgers we got were solid and the bun finally tastes like how I remember the bun tasting in their east coast locations (something about the NYNY location was a bit off). I know people complain about the higher price tag, but I'm officially a convert... no more In-n-Out for me. I'd rather pay up the extra money and go out of my way for my fast food needs. There are also a few TVs in this location, that were a lot easier to view than the NYNY location. When we were done with our food, a nice, very tall, young man proactively offered to put our tray away, which I appreciated. Some of the things I noticed:Customers - geez,  clean up after yourselves a bit citizens of Summerlin! The workers do a great job bussing tables, but it kind of sucks seeing people really not give AF. Entrance - Not very wheelchair or stroller-friendly, and very tight. Summerlin parents, keep the lanes clear when ordering! (again, another complaint about the customers, but I think the business could do a bit more to ease the situation). The space itself is not as expansive as the NYNY location, and their is some but not a ton of outside seating, so you do feel a bit cramped when they are really busy. Restocking - the whole time while we were waiting for the food and eating, this employee took forever restocking the straws/napkins/condiments area and was in a ton of people's way. She definitely could have picked up the pace and finished doing that in 5 minutes or less. Get in, get out, and check on it again in 30 minutes. Hope this place thrives and more great places keep on coming to Downtown Summerlin!Shake Shack is a New York City better than average burger chain that has been around 10+ years and recently opened their 2nd Las Vegas location in Downtown Summerlin.

Also, tasted very good!Lots & lots of calories consumed at this celebration lunch, and was kinda expensive at $42 bucks for just the 2 of us, but well worth the dining experience!YELP 250 CHALLENGE 2015: #246JUICY MELTY BURGERSI had the pleasure of coming here for a YELP ELITE EVENT which also made me want to come back! I typically do NOT eat burgers so if you can make me want a Burger I would have to say *bravo*The staff here are so SWEET & FRIENDLY although I will have to say the so called manager may want to watch what he is saying in an open kitchen... I went to the counter to ask for a piece of lettuce & the worker asked the tall manager guy for a piece of lettuce & he says " what are we... feeding a rabbit?" Ummm talk about turn off.... I am standing right in front of you... that will be my only reason for 4 stars.... They even have dog treats for sale as well which is freaken cute! Also came back here w/ come girlies to grab dessert & another manager that was at the yelp event was giving out little samples of the hot coco which we ended up buying! SMOKE SHACK BURGER $6.69 - the SAUCE is freaken awesome & it has a slight kick of spice which I LOVE since I'm not good w/ burgers... but that spice makes it all good. DBL SMOKE SHACK BURGER $9.95 - double the pattyCHEESE FRIES $3.95 - crinkle fries cooked to perfection & drizzled w/ cheese sauce SHACK 2 O $2.35 - part of the money is donated RED VELVET CHEESECAKE CONCRETE - RICH & CREAMY  but the least rich out of all the flavors!SEA SALT CARAMEL HOT COCO - this is my new FAVORITE place to get hot coco!! It is so thick & creamy & hot!!!The fast food playing field is changing drastically. The era of fast food chains getting away with serving mediocre food cooked in greasy oil with impersonal service in a sterile environment designed to get you in and out is facing intense competition from the newer generation of fast food chains. This new generation of fast food chains is being led by Shake Shack, Five Guys, and Smash Burger.    After hiking in Calico Basin and the streets of Downtown Summerlin, my brother and I were up for a post-hike dinner in Shake Shack. I had been looking forward to biting into a Smokestack burger. In recent times, I had visited Shake Shack four times and  developed an appreciation for their Smokeshack burger.    Just like downtown Summerlin is the future of the regional shopping mall, Shake Shack is the future of the fast food restaurant. My experience describes dining in a futuristic fast food restaurant. After ordering from the menu on the wall (not over a counter), the friendly cashier presented me with a beeper. Instead of waiting by a counter for other people, or hearing order numbers go off, the gentle buzz of a beeper went off when the food was ready. The dining room is an environment that encouraged me to relax. This is totally disparate from a sundry of the fast food restaurants walled with plate glass windows overlooking the highway where the psychological message has been to eat up and get back on the road. In Shake Shack the interior feels more like a casual full service restaurant than a fast food restaurant. From my table I overlooked a couple of close caption HD TV sets playing football and "Shriek." If it was a warm day, I could of sat outside in the patio overlooking the beautiful arroyo park in downtown Summerlin. Whether I sat inside or outside, there was an employee offering to dump my garbage. And if I really wanted to relax, instead of a Coke with my crinkly fries, I could have enjoyed a draft beer. Biting into a Smokestack burger was more than enough to make me relax.     Shake Shack has been consistent with quality. In similar fashion to the past three visits the Smoke Shack burger elevated my taste buds. That 100% angus beef between two soft buns were the delicious prime ingredients that complimented Applewood bacon, red peppers, and that mysterious Shake Shack sauce. The crinkly cut fries were good but not Nathan's greatness.    It seems that Las Vegans including yours truly Daniel. S love Shake Shack. But Shake Shack is doing a Winco business strategy where they build a couple of restaurants that require  people to drive a distance to come to them. Currently the only other Las Vegas location is in New York - New York.   Speaking of New York - New York, I want to clarify a major Shake Shack misconception. There is a misconception that Shake Shack is the IN N Out Burger of New York and they are all over the New York metropolitan area. Not true at all. I grew up in New York and never heard of them. Throughout my young adulthood there was a few locations in the city. Only recently did they expand to the Suffolk County suburbs of New York. They are totally different from IN N Out. Shake Shack goes for around $12 where In N Out is about half the price. Shake Shack offers several different items where In N Out offers a few. From growing up in New York, I feel thar White Castle would be comparable to IN N Out.  On the other hand what is the antithesis of a misconception is that Shake Shack is fantastic. With all the four star reviews including this one, it is foreseeable to walk into this futuristic fast food restaurant and set eyes on the "People Love Us on Yelp"  sticker.

Restaurant name  Hamilton's On The Square
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
4 weeks post opening, Hamilton's struggled on a few fronts.  When we first walked in, the host stand was unattended and we had to wait for a waitress to seat us.  When the host did appear, he was wearing a buffalo plaid flannel and flip flops.  Not the best first impression.The table we were seated at was missing one place setting and flatware that was only corrected after we requested it after our first course was delivered.  Service was slow overall.  Food, on the most past, suffered from a lack of seasoning.  When we requested salt for the beef tartare, we were told that another table also asked for salt and that the kitchen was too busy.  When we pressed, we were then told there is a disagreement between chef and owner regarding salt at the tables.  We pressed again and salt was finally delivered.Hamilton's offers small plates as well as a few larger.  My girlfriend and I ordered:The aforementioned beef tartareLittle Gem saladGrilled OctopusDuck BreastBeyond the lack of seasoning, we thought the dishes were good but not great.  The beef tartare has small pieces of croutons mixed in but needed something with more crunch to be served along side of it.  The salad was on the verge of being overdressed.  We thought the grilled octopus was excellent, perfectly charred and tender.  However, I feel it didn't mesh well with the potato salad served alongside.  The duck was cooked to order (medium rare) but the shiitake puree was overpowered by the honey that was also listed on the menu.Definitely a bumpy experience for us and will need to wait it out for awhile to see how other reviewers fare.

Review Text :
WOW. Worst fast food experience and worst fast food I have had in my life to-date. And I have eaten at Del Taco a few times. I had been to Rally's a bunch growing up in San Diego, and I had decent memories until this last Sunday. Now that this location (which had looked dilapidated for some time now) was open [again?], we decided to go and check it out. Also, my boyfriend had never experienced Rally's. Realizing it was newly opened, we figured it's going to be busy but it wasn't that bad. I have seen the McDonald's down the street busier on weeknight. We waited for nearly 10 MINUTES at the drive-thru speaker just to order. After the first 6 minutes, a guy came on and asked us to give him another second and he'd be right with us. Yeah...no. I was getting really annoyed, I mean I don't mind waiting, just communicate. You have a microphone attached to your face. When we actually interacted with the guy at the window, he was so distracted. There was even a manager there constantly at his register taking over who didn't interject or apologize or seem to be helping at all. When he went to hand us our food, he got distracted and even pulled it back, as if he messed up or forgot what he was doing, and then just sat there talking into headset, dangling our ticket-to-finally-go-home in his hands. I am like "disengage already"! (Hindsight, I shouldn't have been so hasty to accept the order.) We order two of the bacon crisp cheeseburger or whatevers and a medium fry (SEE PHOTOS). GROSS. These were like ABC burgers - already been chewed. I have had a better burger from an inner-city elementary school. And the fries, which they brag about being 'famous', were famously TASTELESS...and stale. Anyway. I hated it. Hope you don't end up like me. If you do go, don't look at the pictures because that's not what you're getting.This was the second time we went there. Had a less than impressive visit the first time but we figured with it being opening weekend we would give them a break.This time the service was just as bad. Upon placing the order for some combos we were told they didn't have drinks. How can a fast food place not have drinks? Then we waited in line for almost 10 minutes waiting to get served by a rude girl who seemed more interested in what was going on inside rather than dealing with customers.The food is mediocre and the large fries are a joke. Don't waste your extra money. It is a shame this place is ran so badly. We were hoping it would be like other Rallys we have been to. Looks like we won't be going back now.Man, oh, man, I just waisted 30 min for fast food...NEVER again. I wish I would have read the reviews before I was trapped in the drive through. People complaining about 10 min waits, I envy you. I started my timer after about 10 min of not moving and after I opened yelp. On top of that, not once while I was waiting, did the cashier say anything. In fact, he just talked to another employee. They didn't even bother to close the window. Forget $15 an hour, these guys need to get paid $4 an hour.

All gifts from the heart are not created equal...and Fortune Seafood Restaurant's fell a little flat (gratuitous reference for the 0.89% of the world that speaks Cantonese).There are certainly better options in Vegas for Dim Sum. The real crime is that the worst items we received were seafood items...your name has the word seafood in it...make sure it's fresh! We came in on a Saturday around 11:30am to find a relatively empty dining room with only a few other tables occupied. We had a sense that it wasn't going to be that great, but you can only judge 95% of books by their covers...plus we felt obligated to stay and write a review since there weren't a lot of reviews to go off in the first place. The service was great!...fast and attentive.  We ordered many of our favorites and few other items:Har Gow (Shrimp Dumplings)Siu Mai (Pork Siu Mai)Pai Gwut (Pork Ribs)Nor Mai Gai (Sticky Rice in Lotus Leaf with some mysterious substance)Hom Sui Gok (Glutinous Rice Dumplings w/ mushroom & pork)Daan Taat (Egg Tart)Liu Sha Bao (Salted Egg Yolk Custard Buns)Steamed Scallop Dish Almond tea bund with lotus seedWe generally eat all that we order, or at the very least take the left-overs home. There were two dishes that were bad enough that we didn't want to finish them: Har Gow (Shrimp Dumplings) & the Steamed Scallop Dish. The seafood was certainly not fresh, spoiling the dishes. The simple choice is to find a different restaurant. If you do find yourself here, without the options of leaving, you would do best to stick to the Pai Gwut (Pork Ribs) and Hom Sui Gok (Glutinous Rice Dumplings w/ mushroom & pork). Still there was nothing good enough to recommend outright and certainly nothing to bring us back.

The $4.99 lunch special (offered Monday through Friday from 11 A.M to 2 P.M.) is what lured me in. Plus, I've been wanting to try this place out ever since I seen the "Now Open" sign. I love me some Indian food! Indian Bowl Cuisine is located off Maryland right across from UNLV in the Chipotle shopping center. This small casual restaurant has plenty of seating and offers quick carry out. I ordered at the register, the owner piled in the food in a styrofoam tray, and I was on my way. I was in and out within 5 minutes.   The lunch special comes with rice and one main entree. There's two different types of rice to choose from. I can only describe the rice I chose as tamarind rice. Most of the tray was filled up with this rice. For my entree, I got the Saag Aloo (potatoes with spinach in a spicy sauce). There was also Chana masala (a chickpea entree) as another vegetarian option. The potatoes weren't as soft as I'd like, but the spiciness level was perfect. I was going to order the vegetarian samosas but was told they take 10 minutes to make from scratch. Maybe next time.Worth a Return Visit?I'm glad to have another lunch option around UNLV, and I hope Indian Bowl Cuisine is successful. My meal was just okay, but super cheap! Can't beat a $4.99 lunch.YELP 100 CHALLENGE 2015: #174Located near UNLV, seems to be  solid lunch option for students and staff- many other reviews mention the lunch combos, but either they've done away with that or it's not available on weekends, because I arrived to menu of made-to-order entrees. I liked that there were so many vegetarian options, but without my favorite saag paneer available (or tikka masala, for the non-veg options), I chose the special of the day: lamb curry, with the cumin rice, and a samosa.Service was polite, food was made to order and packed up for takeout, price ($12) was reasonable for the portion size. I asked for a 6 on their spice scale (1-10) and found it quite mild, but the curry sauce was thick and there was ample lamb. Food had a little more grease than I had expected, and I poured some off of the curry rather than ingest it. Samosa was just okay. Quality is better than some of the other student-focused places on this side of the street.

My dinner at Prairie a few nights ago was a solid 3.5 stars.  The negative first: it's overpriced. In my opinion they should drop the price of every sandwich and entree by 2-3 dollars. I am not someone who has any qualms about a spendy meal, but the prices here seemed a bit excessive.  My boyfriend had a $15 seitan hoagie that was good, but not, you know, Spak-Brothers-Good. Also my fancy grilled cheese could have been fancier, and elevated by addition of another type of cheese or a few more veggies to make it a bit less Basic.  I like the fried sage on it, though, and the salad that came with it was super-yum.  I have to give Prairie huuuge props for their solid vegetarian selection!  When I heard about the concept, I figured it would be another meat-themed Pittsburgh restaurant that would have one vegetarian option and zero vegan options on the menu. How nice to be pleasantly surprised by a number of choices, and I do really want to go back and try some of the dinner entree items.  I am also impressed by the whiskey menu, the quality of the cocktails, and that there are good happy hour specials.  We had both the house mule and the old fashioned, and both were quite tasty and well-prepared.  Our dessert-- vegan apple crisp-- was delicious!!  Seamless service and a relaxing vibe ensures that we will be back soon.

Review Text :
Finally all you tourists that just gotta check out the pawn shop can have some pretty good barbeque here. Now I dont know how Rick Harrison ended up with his name being included in the title but I can only guess when your barbeque is damn good you tend to gain some notariety. That and you were offered a spot in their new plaza-like setting. I guess its a win-win for both parties.Now for the food. I gave the original Rollin Smoke location 5 stars. Why? Because its a stone's throw away from Spearmint Rhino! Ok, maybe that shouldnt qualify but hay, making it rain does make one hungry so hoppin on over to RS should be a no brainer. Sorry to stray off the main subject there, as a guy, I tend to get easily distracted and strip clubs tend to be one of them. Unlike the original location, this new place does not serve beef ribs at the moment. The beef ribs are mainly the number one reason I go to RS because I havnt had anything like them anywhere. Here it is a limited menu. The prices seem to be marked up as well but that should be expected since they are technically on the strip still. What I ended up getting was the 2 meat combo ($19.99) which comes with a side and a drink. Your meat choices are pulled pork, beef hot links, chopped brisket, smoked chicken, or st louis ribs. Your side choices are bbq baked beans, cole slaw, mashed potatos, and mac n cheese. I chose chopped brisket and st louis ribs. As usual both meats were on point. The brisket was a little bit greasy this time around but still good. The ribs were tender and fall off the bone smoke flavored goodness! Mac n cheese was just ok.Some random useful info: When you order your meats, they will ask you if you want sweet barbeque sauce on it or on the side. They also have a spicy and a really spicy barbeque sauce but you have to ask for it. On the tables they have their standard barbeque sauce. They also have wall outlets everywhere for your convenience so you can charge your phone or laptop. Just like the beef ribs, they told me that they dont have wifi for now as well. There are tables outside. Locals get 20 percent off their order. Hours are 10 am to 10 pm everyday. There is a bar right above where they serve appetizers and alcoholic beverages.In closing, I dont understand why you would have a limited menu when this location is gonna breed surefire success. I would rather have you not open just yet in order to make it right with a complete menu. You cannot deny the people their beef ribs, outlaw burger, and smoked meatloaf not to mention fried catfish, more sides, and dessert. The marked up prices def will take advantage of you out of towners.Yelp 2015 Review #70 "Rollin Smoke aint no joke!"568 overall

What can I say about Greens and Proteins?? I can tell you always been fan and this marks the third location in Vegas. I can tell you that every location the food has been spot on. They have a nice diversity of healthy options, whole create your own menu section, options for smoothies really enjoy, and never had bad meal. I ended up getting the Turkey Club Wrap with tofu fries. I think might have been the first time getting wrap. The best parts about it was instead of the normal wrap went with the spinach wrap. Talk about giving the wrap not only different flavor and look! I thought was prefect compliment for the whole dish. It had ample amount of turkey and love the dressing mixed in with the greens some fresh tomato. It nice size wrap one that filling. The tofu fries. Fried tofu especially hard tofu. Beautiful thing. It not only healthier but taste better then fries, Not at all greasy. It crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. I could order whole basket of fries if I cold. The seasoning they out on the tofu is addicting.You can tell not only from the sign that just opened plus get first review. LOL! It feels new, smells new, and things that tradition with the signage and logo. I believe this is the only location that the menu its electronic. I know the smoothies looked even more tasty. It rolls over couple times or least once. Each time keep showing different smoothie on the menu. It making me thirsty waiting or thinking about what am going order for lunch. I like the menu. They sell different nutrition bars Q-West bars to couple other brands. The cucumber water nice touch. Me not really fan of but hear it not only healthy but not many places that offer it. I would say probably about the same size as the other two locations. The service nothing but five stars for me. They greeted us right after entering, offered help with the menu if needed it, friendly, and love the positive vibes. The best part about third location is super close to the house. So now truly if ever need Greens and Proteins fix literally bike down the street or five min drive. Nice option too have in life!! =))))Groupon Alert! $6 for $12 - for this location and their Flamingo location (adding date for relevance: 9/05/15)I've been here twice to date -- once for a coworker lunch and again on a solo breakfast trip. I'm a fan of their Flamingo location since I'm trying to trim down and eat clean. I like coming here since this spot gives me options to choose from outside of ordering salads. On my last trip, I ordered their Green Ginger Limeade (green grapes, spinach, ginger, lime, and opted out of the addition of Stevia). I make green smoothies at home and haven't thought of this combo. It's naturally sweet and green grapes and ginger tone down the addition of spinach. It's a quick and tasty way to get your fruits and veggies in.  I loved the blend of flavors and strong ginger kick. This spot isn't just for smoothies or fresh juices. They offer up a health conscious menu - sandwiches, wraps, pizzas, burgers, salads and more clean eating grub. I've sampled their bison burger and chicken satay in the past and both have  been tasty options. The have a prime Southwest location and may be found within the shopping center (same one as Starbucks, Cracked Egg and Archie's) on the corner of Sunset and S. Rainbow.  I really enjoy having the option of grabbing a nutritious treat around the corner from our office. My coworkers and I have secured this spot as part of our lunch rotation. .

Review Text :
My friend invited me to their soft opening night tonight. While I am aware soft opening is not indicative of their normal service, I do like to provide a sneak peak of what may to come.I have never been to the other locations and thus have zero frame of reference, but it seems like Pearlz already has its own small Charlotte fan club from patronizing their Charleston location. My overall impression by reviewing their menu is that it offers a good selection of seafood options at a very reasonable price. If you don't like seafood (or allergic), they have plain salads, a burger and a steak to choose from.My complimentary dinner started with half a dozen of raw oysters (this time from VA, $8.95 for 6 or $14.95 for 12). They were fresh and of good size but were little bland in taste. I was told they will have varietal oyster offerings (ex. West coast) which will be more expensive but tastier. My appetizer was the peel & eat shrimp ($12.50, 8 to an order, enough to share since they are the bigger shrimps). Slightly seasoned with Old Bay, they are good for the cocktail shrimp lovers. But I am spoiled by my prior fresh shrimps eating days, I found these shrimps to lack that particular bounce and "fresh from the water" taste. 2nd course I chose the Oysters Rockefeller ($11.95, 5 to an order). I may say this is one of the highlights. Very flavorful, not too cheesy, a hint of bacon but not overpowering. However I didn't see the crawfish/lump crab toppings as shown on menu description, but still a solid excellent dish.Lastly I chose the fried shrimp entree. The 2 side items semi stole the show - the homemade chips and the corn fritters. The chips (really chips, not fries) were perfectly crispy. The fritters were slightly coated in powder sugar, giving it a good contrast to the otherwise savory dish. The shrimps itself (I believe they are the same source of shrimps as the cocktail shrimps) were ok; the batter can be lighter in sodium and the weight. For $16.95 there was plenty of shrimps to go around.Ok... I lied, that was not my "lastly;" the last item I had was the cup of seafood gumbo ($4.95) I added at the very end.  And it is legit. Not some tomato based fake stuff. This is the brownish good stuff - how gumbo really should be made from a dark roux. I promise, you want a cup if not a bowl of this!Overall from the food standpoint, Pearlz offers excellent value. So shrimps are not their strength in my opinion, but the Rockefeller and the gumbo were both solid. The portion I saw on everything is good. The tuna tartare looked divine. Fried calamari tossed with peppers is on my list to try. Local beers on draft ($5) and $9 signature cocktails - tho alcohol license wasn't ready as of today. I think Pearlz is ready to shake things up in Stonecrest, and give the big chain restaurants around the corner a run for their money!

This welcoming space, located on Fremont St a few blocks from Container Park, is a foray into combining Southern and Chinese food. The adjoining lot seemed full or possibly off-limits, but I found some free-after-6 street parking around the corner on 10th Street (a plus for choosing dinner rather than lunch).The meal unexpectedly began with wings three ways ($12.00 normally) due to a kitchen error. They had prepared a dish without a destination, so they offered it for free to the new table, us. We accepted it, and I was grateful since I'd actually wanted to order it. The wings were large and looked impressive. The first bite, a chili garlic wing, was actually unimpressive. The meat was either underseasoned or freezer burnt. It could well be the former because the flavor of the meat wasn't that impressive in the Asian-style bbq wings (served with fried onions) or the southern fried wings, but the glaze and crust respectively were yummy. Like the restaurant did for the price, I'm just gonna write this whole dish off for rating purposes.Our actual orders came out at roughly the same time. The shishito peppers ($5.00) were quite good. The sear was good and the charred lime gave it a balanced extra dimension when squeezed carefully. The kinda Chinese riblets ($10.00) were fine on their own. They were tender enough but not falling off the bone. The hoisin bbq sauce was good, but the pork itself wasn't bursting with flavor or juice. Fortunately, the charred lime was available again and really elevated the dish. They really should just add the lime to the standard glaze and be done with it. Because of the lime, it's a must-try-if-you-come-here dish.We also revisited the crispy southern fried chicken ($10.00 for 3 pc). This time, the chicken came in the form of large drumsticks. The seasoned crust was as good as it was on the wings, and the meat seemed a little juicier and more flavorful to me. The sweet pickled jalapeños were a welcome burst of flavors and must be eaten even if you're heat-averse. However, the corn muffins were disappointing. They barely had a corn flavor, the crunchy top didn't have a substantial feel, and the interior wasn't as fluffy as I would've liked. Also, what's up with the toasted white bread under the drumsticks? Do something to it. Like they say on Chopped, transform it. Maybe even a thin layer of butter would've made it interesting. I ended up soaking up riblet sauce with it later on, so it did work out, but it has no place in this dish.Finally, I did try a small amount of the barley vegetable stir fry ($12.00) because a vegetarian tablemate offered to share it. I suppose it's pretty good as far as vegetable stir fry dishes go, but it seemed pricey for being a dish free from protein. I wouldn't necessarily go for it again either in veggie mode or with a +$5 add-on of chicken, shrimp, or pork.Chow's menu concepts are somewhat boring and limited in scope, but I would have given the dishes four stars if they'd been executed better. As it is, I can't say "Yay! I'm a fan." Plus, other little things like the inability to split checks (split payment is OK though) and the lack of hefty chopsticks (disposable bamboo/wooden just reads cheap to me) could also be improved.For now, I'm content with planning to eat at Eat and saying ciao to Chow.It's kitschy. I dig it. Diner-style setup with Asian décor touches like a dragon on the ceiling and matching lions at either side of the door, a menu that boasts both Southern staples and Chinese dishes, and friendly service. Somehow, it works.CRAB RANGOON DIP: A tasty deconstructed version of the dish. Not much crab in the dip itself, but the flavors worked and the fried eggroll skins as chips was fun.KINDA CHINESE RIBLETS: Super tender, drowning in a hoisin barbecue sauce. Mixed feelings on this. BF and I didn't enjoy these as much as we were expecting to.CRISPY SOUTHERN FRIED CHICKEN: Moist meat, crispy skin, dusted with what seemed to be ranch dressing powder? Odd but tasty, it added saltiness that the dish needed. Cornbread muffins were painfully dry, and I don't understand why the chicken is served on sliced white bread? I really appreciated that the batter on the chicken wasn't very thick. Ultimately this dish was just okay.SRIRACHA MAC AND CHEESE: Elbow noodles, cheese, a hint of spicy sauce, and everything nicely offset by a green onion garnish. I liked this more than I expected to, having mostly ordered it because of the low $3 price tag. Service was fast and friendly. The southern portion of the menu (save for the cornbread) seems to be executed better than the Chinese. I'm sure the menu will change a bit as they settle in and see what works and what doesn't. Hopefully the trio of wings (unavailable during my lunchtime visit) will make the cut for my next visit.

My prayers have been answered! There is finally POUTINE in Edinburgh!!! As a Canadian living in this fine city, there are days when I miss Canada's national dish: chips, cheese curds and gravy. But now I can walk over to Bread Meats Bread whenever my poutine-missing heart desires! I first came across Bread Meats Bread via a Google search for poutine in Edinburgh. No results - so I tried Glasgow. This is its second location. Right on lothian road beside the Filmhouse. You can actually smell the scent of beef on lothian road (and I don't think there's anything wrong with that!). I visited on opening day in the evening and it was busy. The staff were very friendly and welcomed me as soon as I arrived. My partner and I opted for a cheeseburger each and decided to share the poutine. OK - the burgers here are so damn good. I'm going as far as to say the best in Edinburgh (and hey they are well known to be the best in Glasgow!). The server asked how I'd like my burger: med or well done. Medium, obs.  A major plus for BMB is that they serve their burgers and food on plates! Real plates! (I'm so fed up of being served food on a chopping board). The burger was quite big, juicy and had lots of flavour.  The bun is also really tasty - soft enough to hold the burger but not too soft that it falls apart. The poutine is amazing and the cheese curds are real and authentic! They def passed the squeak test! My only gripe with the poutine is that they should use hand cut chips with the skin on them. But that's a personal preference! Anyway I'm so happy that Bread Meats Bread is finally in Edinburgh. If you are ever really hungover, then I recommend the poutine as your saving grace!

I have very high hopes for this place.We arrived around 3:00 on a Friday afternoon and were pleasantly surprised by their happy hour specials (2-6PM every day) - $2 selected tapas (apps) and house wines for $5. We sat at the bar and I started with the Miner Chardonnay ($17 a glass, but worth every penny), while my hubby picked a draft beer (also $2 off during happy hour - so $4). We also had the bruschetta (you get to choose 4 of 6 options - $9 HH) and the "Pan de Ajo" (sourdough bread & roasted garlic - $2 HH).The bruschetta was good but be warned that it is not like Postino's - we could have each had our own, and for the $9 price it would have been worth it. We liked every flavor we tried except for the verde. The Pan de Ajo stole the show! A wonderful, warm, fresh baked (circle) loaf of sourdough (accompanied with a soft butter) and a half of bulb of delicious roasted garlic - absolutely amazing. The best $2 of my life.I followed my Miner Chardonnay with their $5 house / HH Concannon (sp?) house Chard and loved it after my taste buds forgot the complex (and amazing) flavors of the Miner.Being so early, we were surprised by the amount of people coming in, hopefully this means they will be a big hit and stay open for years to come. I cannot wait for the weather to cool down and to take advantage of their open air dining room to patio (one of those full wall windows that will completely open up to the outside). This place was MUCH needed in the 'hood.

Restaurant name  Szechuan China
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
I feel very bad writing a negative review about a restaurant that clearly is popular. But I must be honest. A little over a week ago, my wife and I decided to try Szechuan China. When we walked into the place we were encouraged, because we were the only Anglos there. If Asians liked it, it must be good! And for all I know, it is outstanding according to genuine ethnic standards. The hostess was very friendly, as was our waiter, although he did not appear to understand that, when there are a gazillion items on a menu, diners should not be expected to order within three minutes of being seated. When our orders arrived (rather quickly, in fact), both were feasts for the eyes. Everything was great thus far.But that's where the feast ended. My wife ordered a dish that featured mushrooms and tofu. Although beautiful to look at, it was tasteless. We both decided that they must not have added any flavorings to it--it appeared to be just mushrooms and tofu, nothing else (except for, presumably, the cornstarch that created the lovely thickness of the sauce).My entree, a Szechuan dish featuring poached fish in a very hot chili sauce, at first impressed me with its zing. But after a minute or so, I began to taste the salt. Wow! I grew up with traditional Texas cuisine, which means that I was pretty much pickled in sodium chloride by the time I was in my teens--so saltiness is not inimical to my taste buds. But this was beyond the pale. I was still tasting the salt half an hour after I got home, even after rinsing my mouth several times with water. (I should also mention that the dish overflowed with oil.)Because we are impecunious, we never leave food on our plates at a restaurant; we even carry rather substantial containers in our car so that we don't have to ask for unecological Styrofoam containers. Yet this is the first time in our many years of marriage that we have left substantial portions of restaurant dishes on our plates. I was able to eat only about a third of my food before the extreme saltiness forced me to stop eating. My wife ate about a fourth of her entree before its tastelessness led her to stop eating. And we had absolutely no desire to take the leftovers home. I fixed some snacks for us after we got home to satisfy our still-significant hunger.To their credit, the kind folks at the restaurant offered to give us a discount (which we refused). We left a generous tip. We understand it's possible that we happened to order dishes that were anomalously poor. But we figure that, as rarely as we eat out, we dare not risk another fifty bucks by returning to Szechuan China.I'd give Szechuan China 2.5 stars if that was an option. The place is decorated well: quiet, neutral colors, with tasteful accents in richer tones. It's clean and grown-up in atmosphere. But, the food was okay -- not that good, not that great. The dishes offer quality ingredients, but the preparation of the entrees is uninspired and the appetizers average, with no real pop in flavor. We stopped in for lunch, since lunch specials offer a reasonable price at which to try a new restaurant. We were excited by reviews of authentic and spicy food focusing on the Szechuan region.The lunch special menu was made up of only Chinese American standard dishes, which was a disappointment. I ordered the chicken with garlic sauce and fried rice. My partner ordered General Tso's with steamed rice. We also had meat dumplings and the Shanghai spring rolls. We didn't get the soup, since a single-serving appetizer portion of soup was $5. The pricing overall is uneven.My entre, the chicken with garlic sauce, came with chicken, mushrooms, broccoli, and other vegetables. It had little to no garlic flavor, but a pleasant late lingering spice. The entree had far, far too much sauce, and of the slightly too sweet, gloppy variety (so much that I was a little disgusted by it). My partner's General Tso's chicken was crispy, but again too sweet and little spice. The fried rice with my dish was fine, but lacked any aromatics and had no meat for flavoring either. We did not receive spoons with any dish to help serve portions onto a smaller plate.The meat dumplings were in the long wrappers pinched on one side. They seemed like they might contain pork mixed with chicken. They lacked in flavor -- no ginger, garlic, herb -- and were underseasoned. The spring rolls came with a spring roll wrapper. The server (whose English was not great) said he thought they had meat in them. He agreed to cabbage but seemed less sure. They had cabbage in them, but the meat was hard to see or taste. They had a decent texture, but didn't taste like much on the inside. The dipping sauce for the potstickers was vinegary and salty (soy base) with no scallions, garlic, or other flavoring. The dipping sauce for the spring rolls was standard sweet n sour. We asked for hot mustard and received carryout packets.The portion size for lunch was generous enough. The value was decent. The hot tea was good, but was not replenished by mid meal.I complained on the way out that we were automatically charged a 15% tip on the bill for a party of two. The woman at the front counter said they are doing this because in China tipping is not done and many Chinese who eat at restaurants here do not tip. I don't think it's legal for the restaurant to include the tip automatically in the bill, but I'm not sure. There are no signs or notices about it. I told her it would offend American customers. In our case, it also cheated the server, because we usually tip 20%.We have speculated that the many authentic Chinese menu items might be better prepared and interesting. There are many dishes with traditional ingredients (such as tripe). We can't confirm that they are any better, however.Given the underwhelming preparation and the weak service with the required gratuity, I doubt that we will be back.My partner and I were excited to try this place; we both love Chinese food and spicy dishes and we love supporting local businesses. I ordered from the vegetarian portion of the menu and the dish that came looked interesting but it was about 50% fish. I explained that I don't eat animals at all and since the dish was in the vegetarian section and didn't specifically say it contained animals, I was expecting a vegetarian dish. The waitress asked if I liked vegetables (really) and suggested a tofu and bok choi dish. I was a bit apprehensive because "tofu and bok choi" tends to be incredibly boring, but as the staff recommended it, I thought it must be a good choice. NOPE! The dish was swimming in translucent, viscous, whitish sauce that lacked any flavor besides salt. I ate a few pieces of tofu and they were bland and squishy, the bok choi was limp and similarly flavorless. I didn't bother trying the frozen carrot cubes or peas that were floating in the sea of slime. After a few minutes, the sauce began to congeal. It was, quite frankly, disgusting. A server asked if I liked the dish and, trying to be nice, I told her it was very bland and not to my tastes. She asked if I wanted to take it to go (uh, no) and when I said I did not, she picked it up, made a strange face, sticking out her tongue, and took it away. I don't know if she didn't see that I was looking at her or if she was sympathizing.I'm sad to say, the rice wasn't even good. My partner did like his dish and said the fishy tofu was pretty good but also had a slimy sauce. They charged us for all 3 dishes and a 15% tip on top of it! The tip wasn't indicated anywhere that we could see, so basically it's a rip off.I went with two of my co workers. I got the generals chicken. It was crispy. Burnt black crispy.  My co worker got the hunan beef which was 90% fat and cheap meat. The tea tasted like soap water. They brought the food out one order at time with minutes in between. When we got our check we asked to split it. They responded "no split check" and told us that there was a 20 dollar minimum if you use debit or credit cards.  Oh and the lunch didn't come with a egg roll, and no fortune cookies after the meal. Will never return.

I watched as this new building was being built and wondered what it was going to be.  So far two food places with a third to come.I received a flier in the mail with coupons for Marco's and decided to use one of them tonight.  I called and ordered a White Cheezy which is listed under their Specialty Pizza section.  It's topped with 4 kinds of cheese including feta and has  onions, bacon, and garlic butter sauce on top.  I ordered the large which is a 14" pizza.  The person who took my ordered said it would be about 13 to 15 minutes and I drove the mile and a half to pick up the pie.  It was almost done.I paid and then brought the pie home.  It was large enough to serve two (cut into 6 slices), and there's one slice left for morning.  This will be my "hearty meal" before going to give platelets.The pizza was good.  It had a taste from the feta that made it different from other pizzas I've gotten.  There was a fair amount of oil on the cardboard box but the pizza itself didn't taste oily.The restaurant serves other things and they make pizzas that you build the way you want.This is a national franchise with several locations in Las Vegas.  Not the best pizza I've had but not bad either.

Ever since I got back from Taiwan, I havent gotten a single taiwanese beef noodle soup that tastes genuine, up until today. It's not featured on the menu but locals love it. The reason why this soup is legit is because the broth is made out of beef bones so it's packed with flavour, and behind it is a taiwanese chef who trained in japanese cuisine. Their tea is particularly tasty with the addition of roasted nuts and rice. The pancakes come filled with red beans or taro, but taro was the best. I have yet to try their Japanese menu.Went here last night with a small group of Yelp friends, people generally smarter than me about authentic Taiwanese food. All I knew was it had been chilly and felt like fall and I was craving soup, and man did this tiny hole in the wall deliver. We were the only ones in there on a Tuesday night, and the young couple who own the place and make all the food from scratch seemed perplexed but happy we were there, and eventually we got them to come out and chat with us and they were so funny and dear and great. We all ordered the beef noodle soup that Bozan X had told us about, except for the representative from the land of Vegetarian who was well taken care of as well, but will no doubt tell her own story. The soup was just outstanding. Broth that takes 5 hours to simmer to glorious savoury perfection, beef that's falling apart tender, crunchy veg and incredible homemade noodles that I could eat daily. I might go back this weekend for the mooncakes, and around Christmas for all the different cakes the mama chef so proudly told us tales of, and I'll be back before then many times for sure to sooth away the winter chill with these lovin spoonfuls.

Now, granted, I was here once, and it was on their second official day of being open. That said, I can tell a few things right off the bat...+ Contemporary space; open, airy. Mix of stone, cement, and dark colors. + Tons of televisions around the entire bar/space+ Comfy couches in a little alcove near front door/corner+ Outdoor seating (small) with propane heaters+ Big - nay - huge, bar with a ton of seating+ Good for groups; bar hightops easily accommodate groups of 8+ A nice stage for bands (live music most nights!)+ iPads on tables show entire list of beers (drafts, bottles, by style, by ABV, by color, etc)- iPad interface is a bit unfriendly; fonts and colors make it difficult to read. For example, say you want to search for a certain type of beer (a great feature)... you click on the app's "style" icon and a list appears. Only the list background is white and so is the font. There's a very thin silver outline around letters, which makes reading them very difficult. I'd recommend an update.+ iPad Interface shows ABV and cost+ I didn't get an exact count, but they have a decent tap selection - maybe 35-40?+ Tons of bottles+ Full bar, otherwise (cocktails, wines)+ Decent food; menu is "pub centric" - small plates, flatbreads, burgers, sandwiches + few salads+ Pretzel: solid and huge. Easily shared with 3-4 people.+ Meatballs: delicious, but pricey... 4 small meatballs were $8- Tots: tasted like fresh from the freezer with drizzle of sauce, jalapeños, and too much sour cream. Not a ton of tots for price. Beer cheese sauce had strong bacon/smoke flavor.+ Flatbread: extremely thin crust (win!), decent toppings, fresh. Didn't need drizzles of balsamic and whatever else was drizzled over it. Good size for 2 people to share.+/- Loyalty club. Be warned: it cost $15 to join. You get a t-shirt, and you accumulate "points" based on beer purchases. Exactly what you earn isn't clear (just like the cost wasn't clear at first)... we'll wait to see what happens with this.- Service was dodgy/spotty at best on the second night. While it was busy, it wasn't *slammed* and yet our table regularly sat waiting for beers, had to reiterate our order on several occasions, received the wrong beer, received double beers, and just generally had "confusing" service. Multiple servers would check-in on us, none were certain who had done what prior. + Servers were incredibly friendly, just too busy and too uncertain/distracted. This will settle down over time, I'm certain. - Bathrooms are poorly designed. Men's restroom has a beautiful granite double sink set-up, but only one hand dryer. Two toilets, but one urinal. I visited the restroom twice, and there was a line both times, for both toilets and hand dryer. I saw several people leave without washing hands, probably because of the single hand dryer and the wait to use it.- It is *****LOUD***** in here. Like shout at your tablemate loud. I'd hate to see how loud it gets during truly busy times. If I had to venture a guess, I'd say the place was about 55-60% full when we were there, yet my dB meter showed 93-95dB of noise at all times. That's rock concert loud... They need to employ some sound dampening techniques/tools.- Happy Hour is advertised from 3pm - 7pm. And again, I think we paid full price on all of our beers. I could be wrong about this; I wasn't really studying the prices, but I know each of my New Glarus Stag Horn taps were $5. I pay $4-$5 "regular price" at any other establishment, so I'm not sure what the benefit of happy hour was. I would've asked, but our server(s) were so harried, it was really hard to learn anything. I'll be back after things settle down a bit. Still going to rate the place 4-stars because for the most part, it's solid. I know they'll get the other stuff sorted.

MIKE IS BACK! OPA!The West Side has a NEW "GEM" in Town!Mike is a well known Chef in this area and is well known for his Greek and Italian Cuisine. This restaurant prepares well made food. Sauces and many meats prepared in house. The front of the menu says they are a Bakery too so possibly some of the breads might be prepared in house too.I've been to his last restaurant many times and this new restaurant offers a bigger more varied  menu, wait staff, roomy comfortable booths in a nice atmosphere.I came in for lunch and ordered the Salmon Souvlaki Pita. The pita came with my choice of Greek Fries or Greek Salad so I went with Salad. Out comes a big fresh salad and soon after my pita arrives. The pita bread seemed like it was made to order as it was so fresh and hot and the filling was tasty. My husband had the house made sausage with peppers and onions. The sandwich was baked with bubbly mozzarella cheese. We were checked on several times by our server and by Mike.We will stop in for dinner next time as I remember the Myconos Chicken was pretty darn tasty.Portions are large and pricing is reasonable.They serve breakfast (8am), lunch and dinner 7 days a week.Give Mike's a try when your in the area!

My visit left my noodle a little limp actually all of them were limp.We ordered a small pesto with chicken, the pesto sauce was good but the entire dish was cold and the chicken was literally over cooked on a flat top grill with no seasoning and was luke warm.  We also ordered the Japanese pan fried noodles.  The pitiful sized portion (small) was not evev enough for my wife the noodles tasted old and limp and cold.  The flavors were ok. The curry soup was just ok.  She didn't even finish that and was still hungry when we left.  The staff was good.  There appeared to be an owner or manager there but he was the one cooking and I hesitated to complain about the food to him, with the thoughts that it would be taken personally. I would go back,  just not for dinner and not anytime soon.I'm just going to jump right to it. We paid $45 for myself, my husband and my 14 year old. We got 2 lg pasta dishes and a small. All were Terrible and cold. We order a side of potstickers which were hot in spots and ice cold in others. Not sure how that happens but that's when I got nervous. Being pregnant the thought of food poising is always in the back of my mind. The cheesy bread looked like cheesy bread that lacked cheese that had been sitting on your counter all night. Dry and not hot. We asked for our money back on the pot stickers and we got replacements to go instead. Wow, thanks...just what I wanted food to go?!?! Just horrible! Probably the worst place I have ever eaten. I want my $45 back please!I really wish I could give 0 stars. I came in here expecting a quick, easy lunch, but this was far from it. I ordered a salad of the menu, but boy was that a mistake. After I ordered, I patiently waited for 20 minutes, during which time I watch the salad girl make the two slowest salads I've ever seen made. It literally took her 10 minutes per salad. While I watched in disbelief, I observed not a single cook or line person, including what appeared to be the manager wearing gloves. Horrifying. However, I figured the salad girl was using tongs at least so I continued to wait. Then, it happened. She fumbled and dropped a bowl. I watched her pick everything up off the ground and he proceed to put dropped ingredients into my salad that I had waited close to a half hour for at this point.I no longer wanted my food or food poisoning after seeing this. I desperately tried to get someone's attention to cancel my order, but couldn't and actually had to leave with no food and out my money!!!I will never ever be back.

Noticed the Grand Opening sign when I drove by last night, came in this evening for an early dinner. Got an order of fresh spring rolls with shrimp and a bowl of combination pho. Broth was good on the pho, but the meat was mostly fat. Rolls were  just okay, the shrimp was dry and seemed old.  Service was polite, prices seemed pretty low: total was under $15. Seems like they need to work on their quality and consistency.OMG!!!!! FANTASTIC food for a super low price, in a modern, ultra-clean, brand-new space. I LOVED IT!I had bún with grilled shrimp and chicken, plus veggie spring rolls, and everything was orgasmically delicious, fresh and flavorful. I'm not usually a meat person, but the grilled chicken and shrimp in my bún were out of this world! This chef really knows what he's doing....my understanding is it's one of the sons of the guy who runs Pho So 1, so I guess he came up the ranks and learned his shit from the right people.My friend had beef pho and hot tea, and the total bill was $27!! And they were BIG portions! Plus, the atmo was modern and chic, and VERY clean (restrooms too). I will definitely be coming back here again! LOVE IT!!!First timer here, arrived before the noon hour and secured decent parking in the large private parking lot. The intierior is large and there's several flat screens for entertainment.The menu is diverse and has a big selection to choose from. I ordered pork spring rolls and bun bo hue. My BBH arrived first and contained lots of protein and the broth was delish, but contained no pig foot or pork blood since they ran out of the latter - although the waiter did disclose this when ordering.The two pork spring rolls were yummy and the pork wasn't boiled like some places prepare.I tried coming back here for bfast pho but they don't open until 9;00 am but do stay open late till 2:00 am daily. I'll definetly be will be back to try their pho.Upon entering Viet Noodle Bar, I thought it's about as big at Pho Kim Long but cleaner and less chaotic - and I hope it stays that way and not just because they're new. The service has been the best compared to the other Vietnamese restaurants in town. The servers are friendly and attentive.Thit Nuong Cuon (Charbroiled Pork Spring Rolls):Tasted a little soapy probably because of all the cilantro. Not as meaty as the spring rolls from other places. 3/5Bo Nuong Cuon (Charbroiled Beef Spring Rolls):Nice grilled flavor on the tender beef. 4/5Pho Tai Nam:Flank steak and rare steak pho. Their pho comes in 2 sizes: regular and large. I ordered large but it's quite small. The broth is good and they're pretty generous with the meat. 4/5I was so happy they have soy bean milk! I love that stuff. Woohoo!4 1/2 stars. Arrived on a rainy weekday . This was my second visit to this recently new restaurant. Parking hasn't been an issue both times I've visited and the  interier is large, pleasantly eye appealing and spacious.I ordered the oxtail Pho which comes in only in one size. The pho was bomb, contained large pieces of tender oxtail and the broth was yummy,  not greasy and delish.Credit cards are accepted here and they offer free wifi.First impression of Viet Noodle Bar.  Definitely a very clean Vietnamese restaurant, with a lot of TVs showing sports game (at least at the time of my visit).  It felt like a pho restaurant and sports bar hybrid, without the annoying cigarette smoke and greasy spoons that are allegedly washed.  It is very roomy too, unlike many mom and pop type restaurants that error on the side of cramming more tables and chairs than the premise can comfortably accommodate.Based on reading the tips and glancing over some reviews, I knew I had to give their Oxtail Pho a try on my first visit.  Plus the outside temperature is cool, a bit breezy, almost fall-like weather, so a bowl of steamy hot bowl of noodles is perfect.The waiter that took my order was courteous, not too pushy, and gave me plenty of time to explore and take pictures of their menu.  I also didn't have to wait too long when asking for my bill or the credit card to be processed.  The Oxtail Pho also came out of the kitchen fairly quickly, but that is typical of any well run pho restaurant (it is not like they start cooking your from scratch the moment they receive the customer's order).  The portion is good, and there were several large oxtails in the bowl.  The flavor of the broth is good, and the oxtail was cooked fairly well (tender but not to the point that it will easily yield its tasty morsel with a bit of pressure).  I didn't feel that they skimped on the noodles either, which is great (since I always get that feeling at the most popular pho restaurant in Vegas frequented by tourists that's shall not be named). Next time I visit I will likely try one of their vermicelli noodle or rice plates (sadly i did not see any Broken Rice aka Cm tm dishes in their menu).My favorite Vietnamese restaurant in Las Vegas now. Parking is always available at the  shared private parking lot.It was a cold day so I went for the large oxtail and side of meatballs. As usual the pho was incredible here. The service and quality is solid too.Next time I return I'm going to try the grilled shrimp and beef plate for two for dinner which looks delicious.

Second time here.  They are still working out the kinks.  Food is good, nice atmosphere.  Prices are a bit high.  Drinks are coming out slow.  They have to kill the smoking on the patio.  With the doors open all around, the whole restaurant smells bad.  My wife said she won't come back because of that.  I'm still optimistic, but they had better kill that smoking lounge!  Need a kids menu also...  Let's go guys.  We need you up here...Update:So we finished dining.  Here is the final review as we won't be back.Food: Happy Hour sliders, HH quesadilla, kids meal, (2) cheap wines, (3) draft beers.  Total=$76.00 plus tip.  No thanks!  The service was slow.  Our server had tables at the back of the house and front door.  Sections anyone?  My beer sat at the bar for 10 minutes while I stared at it...  . We now have to wash our clothes when we get home for the first time since AZ passed the no smoking ban.  Whole restaurant reeked of cigarette and cigar smoke.  The place just seemed disorganized.  On the way out, two guys walking next to us said they sat at the bar and the prices were ridiculous.  They laughed and said they won't be back.  They went to The Living Room next door.  Too bad.  I had high hopes for the place.  The owner obviously thinks North Scottsdale will pay those prices, but he needs to understand that if they do, they expect a stellar experience and service.  They had better step it up.  They are a sports bar!

Review Text :
My husband insisted on going opening day around 10 p.m., (they opened at 4) and there was none of the opening day fanfare you would expect. It was tough to even locate an employee. Can I be both underwhelmed and nonplussed? Yes, thanks Haggen. There was a lot of empty space in this store. I liked it much better when it was Von's. Food is MORE expensive than Von's and Albertson's which are outrageous! Two bags of groceries were $90.00! I protested then decided to let my deranged husband make the purchase so I could rub it in when he was starving after exceeding the grocery budget. I felt violated by the outrageous prices. I had a colonoscopy that hurt less. We shant darken the door in that establishment ever again. Kiss my cash goodbye suckas! I'm going back to Trader Joe's, Sprouts, and if I'm desperate for something in the wee hours, Fresh and Easy.Worst rebrand in recent memory, with increased prices and worsened efficiency in every department from frozen food to pharmacy.  Not sure if the increased organic section is somehow meant to compete with Whole Foods, but it seems unlikely a place still pushing fast-food Chinese is going to lure the granola crowd across the street while the other changes are likely to send others over to Smith's or Albertsons for better prices and less hassle.I stopped here on the way home to see what it was like.  Now I have and I won't be back.  This is a very large supermarket that should be a Wegmans.  I was looking for three items and to check out the new store that used to be Vons.  What I found was a very over-priced selection of groceries.  I got one of the three items I came for.  The deli section is anemic at best.  As I walked around, I saw 2 litre soda on sale marked down to $1.79 from $1.97.  I can go to a dollar store and get the same thing.  Why on Earth would I take such a sale?Finally, it took more time to check out than it shoudl given the very few customers in the store and there was only one register open.I can see the for lease sign on the building now.Come west #Wegmans, come west!I've only ever watched one episode of the Walking Dead, but I imagine the whole series is basically like this store: virtually empty, save for a few dead-eyed folks (employees) walking around aimlessly, and never once greeting me, let alone asking if I need help finding anything. Clearly no one in charge here has ever heard of the concept of "competitive pricing." Everything is easily a buck more than it should be, if not double the price. If you're lucky though, you might find those bright orange "$1 Manager Markdown!" stickers- except they're only on the truly ridiculous items, like $8 acai juice and borderline-rotten meat.This place wasn't exactly a hotspot of business when it was Von's, but at least the employees were reliably friendly and the pricing was on par with other places in town. Haggen has nothing going for it whatsoever. I'll take the under on this place making the 6-month mark.Went to check out the market on the way home. It is like a cleaned up Von's - bright well lit and free of all the tall fixtures. Nice I like looking from one end of the produce area to the other. What I did not like was the customer service. It was awful . They made an error on my transaction and all they can do is say sorry we are not allowed to give refunds you will have to come back in the morning. Icing on the cake was manager Maryann saying thank you thank you thank you as I walked out the store. First impressions count with me. Treat me rudely and I will just not return. There are many other places that appreciate their customers and want our business and are willing to correct their errors immediately. Shame on Haggens.If I could do zero stars I would. My question is how can this place have produce worse than Von's and charge 2 times as much. They ruined my dinner tonight because I'm not driving over there again at 110 degrees outside.I've been to Haggens three times since they opened. Each time I bought much less than planned because of the sky high prices.  The  only area I found as an improvement over Vons was the seafood. Even there, I had to scold the clerk for trying to give me old chewed up seafood when there was obviously much better and fresher product in the display case.  The only people benefitting from Haggens is Smiths. They are getting all the money I used to spend at Vons.They've let staff go, and it's a ghost town in there at times. I don't think  the corporate powers-that-be understand the local market. Word is they are positioning Haggens as a competitor of Whole Foods and are still in the process of remodeling/restocking. In my opinion, We don't need Whole Foods pricing in this location, however, if they bring quality products at an affordable cost, then we're talking. But the way things are going, they may not last long enough to make that a reality.  The place looks nice (hence the 2nd star), but prices are ridiculously higher than before, and it's not like Von's was the cheapest around. Haggens needs to do something to show locals they will competitive and responsive to local needs. I miss the Friday $5 sales, and during a previous visit, staff weren't sure if the Starbucks was going to stay. Change is inevitable when there's a buy-out, but I hope when all is said and done, this place sells quality at more affordable pricing.

Review Text :
I am a heat-seeking missile with new restaurants in my neck of the woods, so had to visit The Bourbon Cellar since it just opened mere weeks ago. SO MANY PROS with this place! It has a great ambiance, nice bar, contemporary/rustic vibe, and good music playing. All is positive on the ambiance.Chef came out more than once to ask us how everything was (HUGE PLUS!) Our waitress was nice and helpful. The service was great and welcoming in every respect.9 year old daughter ordered oysters, apparently flown in fresh daily from Prince Edward Island. We are huge seafood lovers, and have spent quite a bit of time in Maine and the east coast, so we've had the best. The oysters did not disappoint, they were fresh and fabulous with plenty of traditional oyster fixins'. "Tasted like the ocean!" according to the child. I agree, but she only let me have one! She also ordered a creamed corn side, which she licked clean. I thought aloud, "Where else could we go in Phoenix to have oysters like this?" We came up empty, so if you want an oysters fix, this would be THE PLACE to go!My other one had a nice shrimp and potato soup that she enjoyed. I had the scallops appetizer (2 scallops) plus a salad, and husband had a steak plus roasted potatoes on the side. All was great, and perfectly prepared.Unfortunately, the prices are utterly insane and really puts me at more of a 3 star rating. This isn't Binkley's or even Ruth Chris. The ala carte pricing is crazy. Once you pay $44 for the entree and add a side, you're at $60/person before alcohol, salad, or a dessert. Add in two glasses of wine/cocktail per person and you're at $85. We are not strangers to ridiculous-over-the-top dinners, via places like Binkley's Cave Creek and Joel Robuchon in Las Vegas, so this is not a pricing complaint.Only 1 out of the 4 of us ordered a proper entree. I had two scallops and a salad! One kid had a bowl of soup, that's it. And the other one had 12 oysters and creamed corn side. Bill with tip was nearly $250. A proper meal for each guest would total $100 for the entree + side + salad or appetizer, and two drinks. I appreciate that the oysters are flown in daily, and I appreciate the attention to detail in the food. The food we had was fantastic. Maybe mix it up and have a few "lower priced" entrees with the higher end stuff? To justify this kind of pricing, you have to have a serious competitive advantage. Give the people some bread, or do something to give them a warm and fuzzy feeling -- like they are truly getting a special experience found nowhere else. I don't know what the answer is for this place, but austere ala carte pricing always makes me feel stressed out, and there is no way I could justify a $400 + tip bill for four people on any kind of regular basis. Maybe this is supposed to just be a special occasion kind of restaurant, and not geared toward locals or families. However, I just don't think it's quite special enough - yet - to garner just special occasion guests. Please, please, please rethink your pricing and menu strategy. We DESPERATELY need a chef-driven restaurant up here, and the food is great!! I would be back in a heartbeat if the menu and pricing was revamped a bit. At this price point, though, I just can't see myself visiting again. I hope to revise my review soon.

Review Text :
Soft opening . Limited menu. Only one kind of Poke.Ordered Ahi Belly, Meat Jun and 1/4 pound of poke to try. I have been to the name sake Kuhuku Superette. I lived in Kahuku before moving to Las Vegas.The owner said she only would sell poke by the 1/2 pound. Told her she could keep it. Poke Express is down the road. Brought the food home. Same sauce used for poke was used as marinade for belly.  It was over cooked also came with one scoop of rice and bland macaroni salad, Kim chee, and pickled radish $13.95.Meat Jun fell apart. Breading was just falling off same composed dish as Ahi. $9.95. Too little food for the money. Never saw any sign to make aware of the minimum purchase of Poke. Stupid to begin with. There is no try before you buy on that either. I got so many other places to go. Don't believe I'll ever come back here. I tried to talk to the owner, but she was adamant it's her restaurant.  I agree ...it's your restaurant and it's my money, I'll take my money else where. I said this before I will say it again. Great Customer service will always make up for food short comings. This place lacks both.The corner of Bermuda and Silverado is the place to be. Fresh&Easy, Walmart Neighborhood Market, Bank of America, Eco Cleaners, 7-11... I am always driving by or going to one of these places when running errands.I decided to try Kahuku Poke the other day after staring at it every time I stopped by Walmart for the past few weeks. I got a 1/2 lb of the Shoyu Poke to go and it was a little shy of $10. I recall the lady working the register to be pleasant and it only took minutes to receive my order!The tuna is marinated in a nicely seasoned soy sauce based ponzu sauce with sliced onion and chopped green onion and is INCREDIBLY soft!! It is marinated to perfection - the tuna literally just melts in your mouth. Tuna is cubed into large pieces and only a very few (bound to happen) had a chewy white stringiness to it.The tuna tasted fresh and not at all fishy. (Later found out they never use frozen fish, it's always fresh and shipped in daily!) It's a little pricy for the portion but not at all an issue because I was thoroughly satisfied with the taste. I look forward to trying their other poke next time!

After leaving my gym nearby, I had planned on getting a nice healthy meal but couldn't decide where to go. I drove by Ann and Losee and saw this place just opened. I'm not a huge chicken wings fan but for some reason, I can't resist Wing Stop's Garlic Parmesan wings. Goodbye, healthy meal; hello, cheat meal!I always get Garlic parm wings, hot wings, fries or carrot sticks. They're cooked to order. So, your wings are nice, hot and crispy. The quality of food and atmosphere are pretty consistent amongst all Wing Stop locations. But on the day I went here, the staff was friendly and super energetic.I'm also not a huge soda fan but they have a soda dispenser with a lot of different Coke products and flavors: Coke, Cherry Coke, Coke Zero, Diet Coke, Sprite, Sprite Zero, Cherry Sprite, Cherry Sprite Zero, Strawberry Sprite, etc. They have brewed tea as well.

Came here for soft opening & a couple times after grand opening! I SERIOUSLY so so so greatful to him for opening up a location that would please my cravings for KOREAN food!!! All the employees are freaken attentive & ALWAYS funny which is a necessity in a bar atmosphere! But they do have a great ROLE MODEL so would not expect anything less! My bigger AMAZEMENT is the freaken price point for everything!!! What the CHEAP!!!! like a poor college students dream come true for price point.. like competitive LA cheap pricing! I LOVE IT!!! because that means I could eat variety!MANUAL SSAM CHICKEN $8 - this thing is packed w/ FLAVORS! basically fried garlic chicken & it served w/ some lettuce & a spicy garlic hot sauce too! Light & fluffy & tender I would have to say.... definitely makes you crave more & more.HAE MOOL JUNGOL $25 - this is the LARGE portion of the JJANG PONG TANG which is normally $15 but this soup comes large w/ udon noodles. We had 4 people so this was perfect, although I do LOVE the jjang pong tang because I could enjoy the soup itself! So refreshing that I can't wait for winter.LEMON UNI $7 - I was so freaken EXCITED to see uni on the menu!!! It was so good!! On top of that... they freaken had FRESH WASABI!! I was totally pushing my luck & asked...  they just brought it out after they said they would check!PINEAPPLE SOJU $15 - ummm BRAVO!! most places they just mix pineapple juice & bring it out in a bottle... but here they bring it out in a FROZEN actual pineapple!!! Then as you scoop out the shot you could even scrap off some of the pineapple & create a slushy shot! Plus the frozen pineapple keeps the soju so refreshingly COLD!SOJU $10SAPPARO PITCHER $14THANK YOU THANK YOU jjanga oppa for making a spot like this... of course I do love your AYCE sushi as well... but my tummy can only hold so much raw fish ahahhaha Even though this place is a long distance way from where I live... I will be coming to get my fix!Jjanga, known for their sushi, is now running this spot as a Korean resto with karaoke. I have mixed feelings, since I'm not that into Korean but I really liked the sushi spot that was here before- there are a few sashimi and seafood items on the menu now, but it's largely deep fried, stir fried, and soup dishes.OYSTERS: An order of 6 will set you back a low $10, and they're large. I did not care for how they were seasoned with a spicy sauce, but my BF really enjoyed them.LEMON UNI: This is perhaps my new favorite way to eat uni! Generous portion, good price, served several pieces on a halved lemon. Squeeze for more juices and flavor. Would get again!BEEF TATAKI: Decent flavors, it's a simple dish and it's about average here. Not necessarily something I'd order again.GARLIC CHICKEN LETTUCE WRAPS: Well, there was lettuce and chicken. Lettuce was weird small pieces of iceberg that did not easily make wraps, and the chicken was juicy and breaded but lacked flavor. The provided sauce was not garlicky, but more of a peppery paste.SCREAMING ORGASM: Sashimi salad, super saucy. The sauce wasn't flavored quite as I was used to, a bit less acidic. Generous portion, would get again.Service at the bar was friendly, and they kept most of the cool glow-in-the-dark décor from when this spot was Fish in the Spotlight. I'll have to come back for actual Korean dishes, but I'm still mourning the fact that this isn't a sushi spot any more. I'd really prefer if this was still sushi and karaoke, regardless of the name.

It's somewhere between a 4 and 5. Since I'm sleep deprived and all hopped up on coffee, we'll round up for good measure to a five.I have been so excited to check this place out ever since I saw the reviews start popping up on Yelp. So when my fabulous, globe-trotting, six language speaking friend Dianne texted that she needed to be fed, I knew this was the perfect spot to bring her. A breakdown of our order:Veggie Briouats- I'm not vegetarian, but we went with these as a suggestion from the guy who took our order. He was right, you won't miss the meat with this savory filling. This is an item I will definitely order every time.Kefta Brochettes- delicious meatball-like kabobs. It comes with a harissa yogurt dipping sauce. Rubbed chicken and apricot- this was Dianne's entree. I loved the flavors of this. Definitely a big enough portion to share or divide up to make two meals. Kama veggie tajine- I had my heart set on the hearty veggie with chickpeas, but they were in the process of cooking a new batch and I was too hungry to wait. So, I went this route and ordered it over couscous. This is such a filling dish. I was stuffed less than half way through and enjoyed the leftovers the next day for lunch. I will be back to get the veggie and chickpeas!The couscous is really good by itself. They slow cook large batches daily. It has a a great flavor. Make sure you try it on its own before mixing with your entree. I know my Twitter friend Katie L. is obsessed with the falafel here. I haven't had a chance to try it yet. If you're not sure what to order, don't be afraid to ask questions. They are happy to help. As we were leaving, the guy ran outside to track us down because he found a keychain on the floor and thought we had left it. Super nice. Ajbani is located in the old Second Helping spot next to Three Amigos. It is primarily a take-out place, but they do have a few small tables inside and out. They also have a cooler with some beverages (water, Honest Tea). Kudos to the crew here for bringing an underrepresented cuisine to the Queen City. This is such a great addition to Plaza Midwood and Charlotte.Ajbani.Moroccan food has landed in Charlotte and it's delicious. There's plenty of Couscous for everyone. If you've never tried food from Northern Africa, you're in for a treat!Go with a group of friends, like we did, so you can try a bunch of items!Berber Chicken: roasted chicken with saffron, cinnamon and garlic over couscous.Falafel Sandwich: actually - tender and smaller pieces - not dry at all.Apricot Chicken: great flavor. Dry rubbed chicken served with olives, apricots and veggies. Yes, your chicken was better than mine! Don't rub it in.7 Veggies with Lentils: really nicely balanced vegetable stew with the perfect amount of heat.Keftah Brochettes: Moroccan BBQ style meatball kebabs - a nice meaty char served with Harissa yogurt sauce.Veggie Briouats: little savory Phyllo pies - you won't miss the meat!Tomato and Caper Salad: super summer dish made with a hint of preserved lemon.Eggplant Zaalouk: roasted eggplant dip with garlic and tomato. The owner is very friendly and stays on top of quality control, making sure he's happy with the dishes and their appearance.There are a few tables indoors and out, but you know how that goes in Charlotte. Either  face the brutal heat outdoors, or the hot air wafting over from the kitchen prep area. Take out is probably your best bet during the summer!

It's fast food, so the quality is only going to get you so far, but nonetheless, the service is always great here. Usually if I place an order for delivery, it arrives before the said time frame and the food is hot. I usually get the Mao Po tofu entree and they have yet to disappoint.

Restaurant name  Station

Review Text :
Despite consistent Bloomfield efforts to Keep Pittsburgh Shitty, Station enters the neighborhood as the restaurant that no one wants, but everyone needs. As a resident of the area, I'll admit that I wasn't totally sold when I heard about Chef Curtis Gamble's classy casual yuppie hip dining joint injected in the heart of Bloomfield. After only being open for a week, though, the warm hospitality and enthusiastic attitudes of the restaurant are already spreading the great reputation that it deserves.The owners are committed, friendly, and eager to meet their new neighborhood. The service was perfect--not too obtrusive, not too serious, and never neglecting (even in a nearly packed house). The drinks were refreshing, and the food was spectacular.The tagliatelle is handmade using the pasta maker left over from whatever old Italian joint was in the space decades ago. The heirloom tomato salad features fresh dill and an Old Bay mustard. The chicken is perfectly crisped and complemented with bread pudding and grilled lettuce.And the space rules. Relax at the bar with a cocktail, walk in for a nice meal near the bar, or make a reservation in the dining room for a more intimate atmosphere. I hope Station sticks around the area, mostly because it's nice to be able to walk to a fine-dining restaurant for a meal and cocktails without worrying about how I'm going to crawl home.This place is really like nothing Bloomfield has ever seen before, yet they really make you feel comfortable with a casual vibe, just like Bloomfield itself! The bar is beautiful and the drinks are a work of art, thanks to the master behind the bar. If you don't get a cocktail here, you're really missing out. The most inventive one I've seen is the Ruby Queen, beet juice at it's best, spiked! And my favorite so far, the Manhattan. It's really all about the seasonal produce and interesting ingredients to give a dish personality and flavor. The first time I came here I ordered the heirloom total salad, which was every bit as good as I'd hoped it would be, with some playful twists. The golden tomatoes dill and sweet corn mixed brilliantly together. And the fermented cherry tomatoes were such a great and unexpected element of an already awesome salad. For an entree I ordered the crispy chicken breast and leg. I NEVER order chicken in a restaurant because it always ends up dry, but I seriously trust that Chef Curtis will whip up something incredible here. I was not disappointed in the least. It was tender chicken, lightly breaded and not over-coated by any means. The bread portion came in the form of dirty bread pudding with a corn puree that I wanted to lick off my plate.The second time again I ordered the Butter Poached Walleye. Every single item in this dish was drool-worthy. the walleye was excellent, the green beans and fingerling potatoes were a great accent but the saffron dumplings were the icing on this cake (don't even get me started on their popcorn panna cotta...soooo good!!!). I've actually only eaten in the bar area so far. First night was PACKED and admittedly a little too loud (am I old??). But my second time I hesitantly sat in the bar area again and the noise level was totally fine. I could hear everything my friends were saying... unless I was too busy stuffing my face.I can't wait to keep coming back and seeing what rotates on the menu seasonally. I imagine each time will be just as good as the last, if not better! Get ye to Station, stat!We went to station for my birthday a few weeks ago. We were a group of 8 and sat at the high top tables on the bar side of the restaurant. It was a little loud, but not too loud that we couldn't still converse. We would have preferred to be on the dining side where it is quieter, but when you have a large group you take what you can get! My husband and I shared an order of wings as an appetizer and we both agreed that they were the best wings we've ever eaten. EVER! They had so much meat on the bone and were deliciously crispy. The flavor was also out of this world! For dinner, we also both had the Pork Tagliatelle. It was also a winner. It was a rich pork meat sauce with a one hour egg on top of thick ribbons of pasta. I got full and couldn't finish my plate and it was so upsetting because it was delicious and I wanted to keep eating!The service was good, but we could have used some more water by the end of the night. All four of the glass carafes at the table were empty and the waitress never refilled or brought new ones.

Review Text :
I'm letting all of you know that Angry Crab- Peoria, is now open!They don't do barbecue or pizza like some of their sister restaurants in PHX, Mesa and the Tukee- here it's all about crab, shrimp, crawfish, crab legs, mussels, clams, oysters, po boys, catfish and several other things that swim. Pro tip: dress down because you will get messy. Need to take a shower soon after dining messy. Might wanna drive through a car wash with the windows down messy. But it will be worth it. The staff is very friendly and if you need help tying up your bib, they'll hook you up.It's across from Lee Lee, on Cactus, just west of 75th Ave and at least for now, only open for dinner from 4-10, 11pm on Fri & Sat. The atmosphere and vibe is so unlike anything else in the area, and of course, so is the menu. I've been waiting on the "OPEN" sign in the front window to be turned on for about 4 months. It's a long overdue "interesting" addition to the neighborhood and I'm glad it's finally open!It was a busy friday night! They told us the wait was about 45mins... well 15 mins later, I got a text saying that our table is ready, awesome! Aaron, our server was nice and accommodating. I ordered my usual shrimp trifecta mild and my friend ordered the soft shell crabs with a side of cajun fries. The fried crabs were huge, it comes with a dipping sauce and a side of coleslaw and lots of cajun fries. My trifecta shrimp was very juicy & it's finger licking good.. with lots of lemon juice! From Mesa, to Phoenix, and now here in Peoria.. My experience is always great!

Restaurant name  Chile Addiction

Review Text :
My family is originally from New Mexico, so I grew up on stacked enchiladas, sopaipillas and posole. When I heard Chile Addiction had opened in the southwest side of town, I was so excited to give them a try. I was thoroughly impressed by the food and the service. So impressed, that we ended up coming back not once, but two more times.I have tried the stacked enchiladas with pork verde, posole, stuffed enchiladas with pork verde, chile adovado, huevos rancheros, sopaipillas, tamales, breakfast burrito, churros and fried ice cream. Every single thing I have tried has been great and definitely has that nostalgia factor going for it.The service here is beyond wonderful. The servers and owners are so friendly and welcoming and make sure refills are plentiful. They've even offered us free dessert as an apology for our food taking too long. The funny thing is we didn't even notice a delay, but they insisted that we order dessert on them.I plan on making this a regular spot and I hope others take the time to experience this regional cuisine that holds a special place in my heart. Just skip the desserts as they are not good.Family owned with colorful and thoughtful décor- and that's just when you first walk in the door! Service, even for a simple takeout order, was friendly, made menu suggestions, and even tossed in some extra sopapillas. Menu has all of your southwestern favorites, with both red and green chile.The green chili stew was thick and well-spiced, packed with potatoes but only a few bits of pork. Good flavor in this dish, and a good price, which included accompanying tortillas. I also added on a chile relleno (with both red and green sauce) from their a la carte section, but found it soggy and overbattered. The sauces were on point, though. Bring your hankie, because your eyes will be tearing up at the heat.However, I'm not a fan of the gimmicky drug/420 references all over the menu- referring to a breakfast burrito as a blunt, for example? I find it tacky and in poor taste, unless your target audience is high school teenagers. Bonus points for offering a Yelp check-in offer for free dessert with purchase.New Mexico style Mexican food?!? I've never had that, I needs to go to there! And so there I went. Bright-eyed and bushy-tailed declaring this a food adventure. Especially seeing this place so highly rated on Yelp... again, don't believe the hype.This was a major food fail for the most part. First and foremost, it took about 10 minutes for someone to come by and say hi and take our drink order. Chips and salsa arrived shortly after. The salsa was a bit spicy, which I liked, but my dad and sister don't do spicy, so they only had a quick taste before tapping out.I ordered a cup of Pozole. It was delicious, heavy on the hominy (which mama likes), and was presented in a large bowl and tasted homemade. My little sister ordered a carne asada burrito, refried beans, and rice. I had the stacked enchiladas with carne adovada with calabacitas and whole pinto beans. My dad opted for a combo with a beef enchilada, chile rellano, and a carne asada taco. We also got a side of sopapillas which weren't touched. When the order came out, my dad's taco was MIA. The taco appeared like 20 minutes later and we declined it, they offered to let us take it home, and I did with my left overs.So let's talk about the food. It was bland and kind of boring. I was expecting more exciting flavors! New flavors, but everything fell flat. The only stand out dish at dinner was the Chile Rellano. It was the dankest of the dank and probably the best one I've ever had, but a Chile Rellano does not a 5-star review make.Thanks to Yelp, we got a free fried ice cream as we looked over the check. Fried ice cream was great, but it wasn't anything I hadn't had before.Chile Addiction didn't leave me with even a craving or much to remember them by. I really wanted to like this place. I really want little independent places to make it! I really root for the underdog! I just can't give them more than 2stars. Poor service with less than mediocre food. I'm chopping it up to rookie mistakes. Will venture back, but very under-whelmed (that's the opposite of overwhelmed, right?).This has been on my radar for a few weeks and we went here for dinner tonight.  Walking into the restaurant is a treat.  It is so well decorated with New Mexican, Southwestern and chile items that it's very pleasant.We were soon greeted by Amy who showed us to our table and was our server.  After looking over the menu, we ordered a burrito for my wife with refried beans and Spanish rice and I got a chimichanga filled with carne adovada.  My two sides were pinto beans and calabacitas.  I ordered red sauce--regular spice level--for my wife and I got the triple hot green sauce for my chimichanga.  We were brought a basket of chips and some salsa that had a good kick to it.  Even my gringa wife is starting to like spicier foods.  Win!Our dinners came and they were very good.  Andrea thought her red sauce was spicy but she liked it.  My triple hot green sauce was great and it added great flavor to the adovada.  The only minor drawback was we were brought no sopapillas despite the menu saying that all meals are served with sopapillas and two sides.  As it turned out, we were full enough without having the extra amount of food from the sopapillas.For dessert, we got an order of fried ice cream with chocolate drizzle.  Very good and large enough for sharing.Prices are very reasonable and for some reason we had a $4.35 credit applied to our bill listed as a coupon.  We didn't have a coupon.  Our server, Amy, was a verry pleasant person.  She made you feel welcome.I wish the menu offered a bit more choices but I will be back to try the stacked enchiladas."This is gonna hurt me more than it's gonna hurt you."Having grown up in Albuquerque and Santa Fe and having a true love for New Mexican cuisine, as well as knowing how to cook New Mexican cuisine, imagine my absolute delight that someone had decided to open a New Mexican food restaurant in Vegas apart from Carlitos Burritos.  (Which, by the way, is a SMASH hit 5 STAR place.. and the Nevada Governor's fave place to visit when in town, I know, I was there when he said it himself, but I digress...) 1 star for having the "huevos" to open up such a restaurant 2 stars for the beautiful Southwest décor, complete with an RC Gorman print on the wall... Regretfully that is where I will leave it.  Service was miserable.  NOT a crowded afternoon, it was AARP / toddler hour.   Took FOREVER to seat us and there were more than enough open seats.  Once seated, we counted 18 minutes until someone came to our table.  That was after my husband had to flag someone down.  These are the basics, people.  Once we did order it was an eternity to actually get our food.  Carne Adovada was super dry and not worth a third bite.  The pork chile verde was loaded with large potatoes, no hatch green chile spice at all and one piece of pork.  Really?  My husband and I were so disappointed.  I seriously have no words for the level of gross.  Too bad, it would have been a huge hit for my family had it been better.

I came here for lunch one day since it's down the street from my work. I ordered the chicken Katsu. Instead of white rice it actually comes with friend rice which I thought was a good twist. The Katsu was good. Remember this isn't Onos or L&L so you're not going to get the best Katsu ever. But it was good. For drinks I got the Mandarin Oriental. Omg! For $9 a drink, you definitely get your money's worth. I actually thought it was a bit too strong. Each sip was like taking a shot each time. I thought their dishes were a bit pricey. We're talking around $12 a plate. It would be nice if they had lunch specials. They have a very big menu so there's definitely a lot of items to try.

Just an update to say that aside from offering truly exceptionalicious baked goods at truly sweet prices, the staff here are beyond nice and fair. I just saw them load up a customers bag with 9 croissants and charge her for 6 because they were smaller than usual. Myself and everyone in the fast moving line smiled and thought to ourselves, I'll be back. I love it here.

Review Text :
True GritGreen Life Café wants to be all about the Zen experience and fully takes advantage of its cozy setting on Monroe Avenue in the former location of the Macha Tea House.  Unfortunately, they forgot about some basic restaurant tenants such as properly seasoning its food, thoroughly cleaning ingredients so customers don't get a mouthful of grit and periodically checking on its patrons during their dining experience.The restaurant's cool quotient is high with fresh flowers on the tables, a citrus-infused water cooler, and plenty of hip knick-knacks sprinkled though its intimate setting.  The menu is limited, a number of smoothies, coffee drinks, wraps and crepes.  The person behind the counter didn't attempt to engage me as I perused the menu to offer any suggestions.  I elected to go with the $9 falafel breakfast wrap (falafel, scrambled eggs, roasted peppers and eggplant and mushrooms) and paid the $1 up charge to get the freshly made sweet potato fries.  The dish looked spectacular, with the deep orange fries contrasted against the green tortilla wrap with a pale yellow curry yogurt dipping sauce.  However, kitchen failed to put any crunch on the exterior of the falafel.  Both the wrap and the fries were woefully deficient of salt.  The bigger sin was that with every other bite, it felt like I bit into a grain of sand.   Not cool, Green Life, not cool, you've got to do a better job of cleaning your ingredients.  The last disappointment was the post sale service, or more precisely, the utter lack of post-sale service.  The restaurant was not exactly overrun with customers during my visit, so it disappointed me that neither front of house staff member ever checked in to see what I thought of my meal.  There are limited weekday breakfast options in this area, so I really hope that Green Life gets its act together.  While I will probably return at some point (I'm a sucker for a well-prepared savory crepe), I am going to give them a couple of months to get improve food offerings and their customer service.

Review Text :
Went here yesterday with my brother & our girlfriends. I'll admit, me & him were always going to be easy sells - anything titled "The Beer Kitchen" was always going to be a winner for us, and the fact it was done by our favourite beer, even more so!!The place looks very cool when you go in - bright, open, exposed brick, etc. There's plenty of seating in there too, with the added bonus of not cramming you in like sardines too! We all noticed on the way in, a stool section set up for quick working lunches - very clever!But onto the big bit, the food.... I'm always dubious about steak sandwiches anywhere - you always end up with the thinnest, toughest cuts of steak, and spend most of your time trying to chew through! Not so here - thick, juicy cuts, red in the middle, and full of flavour. Easily the best steak sandwich I've ever had. My brother went for the fish & chips - the batter was very crisp and full of Innis & Gunn flavour! The mushy peas were epic too!! Both the girls went with the chicken burger - which again, looked amazing. We all had food envy, which is a first!Of course, drinks are covered by an extensive choice of their best beers (and a selection of others too). There's also wine, gin... all your usual other bits! I went for their "beer flights" which is essentially a taster of 4 varieties. Soon as it came out, my brothers bottom lip began to pertrude, and so began 10 minutes of "I should have got that..." Being the nice older brother that I am, I let him have a (small) taste of each.I think we have a new contender for my favourite place in Edinburgh!!

It's been that kind of morning.Running errands, getting things done, sleepy from working the night before. As I'm going from place to place, I browse through my Instagram to see a post that a new bakery/cafe was right down the street. I look on Yelp, it looked like they just opened yesterday. No pictures. Hmm. I look back on IG and see one of their Apple Crumble Pie. Whoa. I'm a sucker for crumble anything. Let's go, I said to myself, you need a break.Quaint. Cute bright ambiance. Very much what I'd envision a corner cafe in France. The owner and girl behind the counter greeted as I scoped out their display. I mentioned the Apple Crumble Pie, since I didn't see it. Walnut Pie today instead as he just put out a limited batch for their first week of opening. Whaaat?!?! Bummer.I love their tea display, all the leaves in small batches with a clear cylinder top which the owner said I could open. The cylinder captures the aroma of each batch, it smelled heavenly. I sat down with my Green Tea Passion Fruit and Almond Pie, took some pictures, and just relaxed. The tea was fruity and smoothing, the Almond Pie was light and buttery. I had to restrain and take most of it home. I'm sure they can put together a box of pastries and cup of coffee to go, but this isn't that type of place. It's one where you sit, sip your latte, chit chat with friends, and enjoy. We don't do that enough, or at least I don't. I wish I could give it 5 stars, being I'm FTR. Hopefully, I'll be able to the next time I visit, fingers crossed that they have that Apple Crumble Pie!Sweet little French-inspired coffeeshop facing the street at Rainbow and Patrick! Interior is open and modern, with cute French-country-style décor touches. Bonus points for the bookshelf wall in the back, and I dig how they used room dividers to lend the tables a bit more privacy.Coffee menu has all of your favorite staple drinks, I especially like how they have peppermint mocha available  instead of keeping it a seasonal special- I got it with soy milk. There's also a limited food menu of salads and sandwiches, most under the $10 mark. Props for opening so early (7AM!), and making the food fresh- unfortunately, the service was somewhat standoffish considering I was their only customer. My intention to pick up lunch on my way to work didn't work out, but I will be returning shortly to try one of their salads and hopefully adjust my rating upward . Pastry selection is limited, but they do offer macarons.It's nice to have a little quiet time to yourself on a Sunday morning. And then some guy just has to walk in and quietly look at your baked goods and menus...Such was the scenario for the young lady in the front when I walked in to Rosallie this morning. She's probably new, or else it was too early in the morning, but she didn't really ask me anything while I perused the items. Some might find this standoffish, but I was very happy to take my time in relative silence.On one menu board, they have various warm items served with salads, as well as sandwiches, soups. There are a few more complex plates with bread and/or croissants plus meats, cheeses, and spreads depending on which menu item you choose. On the other board, they list their various coffees and teas, included french press options for both types of liquid caffeine delivery, flavored specialty coffees, and teas that have their leaves displayed in glass containers near the register. There are also croissants, breads, macarons, cookies, and other baked goods on the counter or in a glass display.A friend had made urged me multiple times to go, so I finally obliged and followed some of her specific recommendations. I chose the quiche lorraine ($8.90), which is one of the "salad" items, and a plain croissant ($2.10). The quiche was delicious and really fluffy, with a nice crust and just enough bacon. The salad had fresh mixed lettuce, julienne carrots, and halved grape tomatoes, all dressed in a great portion of vinaigrette. The portion of that dish may only satiate smaller stomachs, which was fine with me since I had other eating to do later on.As for the croissant, I was only going to taste a bit of it but ended up eating almost half. It was so alluring with its flaky crust, fluffy interior, and balanced butter usage. If I can't stop eating something as simple as a "plain" croissant, then they're doing something good. I later found out through small talk that the gentleman who owns the place is indeed originally from France. Leave it to a Frenchman to make a great croissant, right?I also ordered a "large" iced tea ($3.00 for 16 oz), opting for the green tea w/ passion fruit. It had a nice flavor with no bitterness and that hint of passion fruit coming through. I didn't feel the need to add any sweeteners whatsoever, although I would have reached for the small pitcher of honey if I'd been in the mood. Along with the food, it was enough to boost my energy for the morning ahead. I was a little disappointed that the cup seemed to be chock full of ice, and I'll either request less ice next time or wait for cooler weather to try a hot tea. I really like the idea of hot tea from French press as my parents are wont to do.This new cafe at the northeast corner of Rainbow and Patrick is easy to locate. They have "Le French Cafe" lettered on the south side of the building, and it seems to be intentional since the 'L" is stylized the same way as in their main "RosaLlie" logo on the building's west-facing facade. There appears to be ample seating for a small crowd, including traditional tables with slightly cushioned chairs, window counters with hard stools, and some couches and armchairs. I wouldn't mind trying the latter section next time except it seems inappropriate for food. Ordering coffee, grabbing a book, and sitting down to relax would be great. Even the music helps since it's at a low volume, with a mix of softer songs from contemporary artists and Motown.I'll certainly be back to try some of their breads and other baked goods. While I haven't tried that many French bakeries in town, this one seems like it should compare favorably to the best.(QUICK UPDATE 9/9/15: They brought the full complement of owners and employees out for the grand opening. As one of the first 25 people to visit, I got a free coffee voucher valid today only. I opted for a hazelnut praline served hot which was a great not-too-sweet treat to start the day. The mini plain and chocolate croissants were free and may have lost a bit of the magic of the full-size, but I learned in the evening that even a day-old almond croissant is buttery, flaky, and fantastic.My lunch, which I also purchased at regular price, was the Nord sandwich, a smoked salmon treat with my choice of multigrain bread. The bread ratio seems unbalanced at first glance, but the smoked salmon is powerful even in one layer, and the bread would be delicious even unadorned. Final note from today was the complimentary chocolate chip cookie, which was quite delicious, reasonably chewy, and quite buttery. Not actually my favorite chocolate chip cookie in town because the chocolate chips are a little sparse, but it'll hit the spot if anyone has a craving.)Since my last visit, this spot seems to have blossomed. Came for a few afternoon visits and staff were friendly and welcoming. Finally got a chance to sample the food and have fallen in love with the madeleines and sandwiches, particularly the Est (brie cheese, tomato, pesto, and greens, all on a fabulous brioche bun).  I haven't camped out with a mug of tea yet, but as the colder weather settles in, I'm coming by more frequently for grab-and-go coffees, which are always just right. Come by when you have some time to kill and explore all the little seating areas and the owner's decorative touches- there seems to be a story behind everything. Staff is very professional, and Jonathan is great at suggesting items to try.Items Selected:AmericanoDuck Confit on Whole Wheat Petite Tourte with Onion JamMadelineChocolate Almond CroissantWalnut PieApple TartAlmond FeuilletinePetite TourtePraline Buche NoelAlmond CroissantCroissantMacaron - Pistachio, Chocolate, EspressoPalmierDashing down to South Rainbow Boulevard shortly after hearing about Rosallie to find the work of Jonathan Pluvinet shockingly authentic for French pastry in Sin City it was only a matter of time before a return trip was planned to see more of the Niece native's growing variety, a few days exploring Bordeaux recalibrating the palate, but in no way changing opinions that Pluvinet's tarts and viennoiserie would compare favorably to those in his home country.Greeted like a friend by Pluvinet on Saturday, though I had hardly made his acquaintance prior to co-writing an article about the Rosallie in David Magazine, it was with Christmas decorations in full display and festive music overhead that the sizable cafe again extended greetings and with stories exchanged about his skiing background, move to America, and childhood working at his family's restaurant the young chef's knowledge and passion were readily evident, a dedication to his craft seemingly already noticed by locals as a steady stream of traffic sat down to breakfast or opted to take home pastries by the bag.Intelligently expanding his selection slowly, a calculated maneuver in a city where enormous menus of mediocre fare are generally truncated quickly...at least for the restaurants that last more than a few months...the focus at Rosallie remains pastry, sandwiches, and salads plus tea and coffee, the later besting any in France though the sheer quality of the beans while the imported French duck atop fresh baked bread is rendered in-house to a crisp succulence beneath lightly sweeten onion jam.Having already sampled several baked goods, and as such allowing Chef Jonathan to serve whatever he pleased, first bites of a Madeline previously marred by chocolate spoke to far greater flavor and softness this time around while the almond croissant imbued with chocolate was every bit as lovely as butter and almond versions experienced last time, a huge mess still made by shards of the shattering shell.Not one to 'Americanize' the menu, though an elegant 'apple tart' would properly rival all but the most elaborate Tart Tatin overseas, those looking for something rarely seen Stateside are well advised to invest in a slice of Walnut Pie, the bitter nut more common in Europe providing a great bit of balance compared to the more common Pecan version found throughout America that is oftentimes far too sweet.Impressed by the thinness of feuilletines and a Palmier that probably should not be eaten in the car or anywhere with rugs unless a vacuum is nearby it was with several gifts to-go that I bid Adieu to Jonathan and his growing team, the macarons still perfect with the natural pistachio flavor particularly impressive while croissants raise the bar for everyone else in Southern Nevada, as too does the buttercream Buche Noel that comes as a sharable portion in one of three flavors, the cheerfully decorated praline version outshowing 'yule logs' from Manon, Bouchon, and even Jean-Phillipe.***** Finally a place consistently offering croissants on par to those found overseas and really making an effort to grow the business through quality and craftsmanship it should go without saying that Rosallie is a special place that will likely only continue to improve, another in a growing line-up of Off-Strip Chefs that need and deserve their community's love and support.

I almost didn't come here to eat tonight, because I am not into eating really spicy food. But I was visiting my friend's store and mutual friends dropped by for a visit and invited us to try this popular Chinese restaurant from Alhambra, CA. that just opened up in Chinatown.While walking over here, we were even discussing why this particular spot have host quite a few failed restaurants in the past few years, in spite the fact that the restaurant next door always seems to be busy.We arrived right after 5pm, and there was already a crowd standing, presumably waiting for an open table. The restaurant is sparsely decorated, there are Chinese opera masks acting as ornamental points of interests on the otherwise unremarkable interior walls of the establishment.  But I don't think anyone really paid attention them.After glancing through the menu, our party had picked two appetizer portioned items immediately, while debating on which entree items to ordered. In the end we opted for the following:1. Pork with Garlic Sauce 蒜泥白肉89. Wonton with Red Chili Sauce 紅油抄手22. Boiled Fish with Green Pepper Sauce 藤椒魚56. Toothpick Lamb with Cumin 牙籤羊肉The first two items are a must!  I can literally order that and be able to down 2-4 bowls of rice with these Chinese comfort food. The sauce is the secret trump card of nearly divine deliciousness (sadly it is not vegetarian friendly. But that does not affect me.) The pork is sliced thin and cooked by a chef that have obviously perfected the dishes. The wonton is good, but their version of the Red Chili Sauce is superb!!! Major nom nom time as soon as the servers dropped off these two dishes!!!The Toothpick Lamb with Cumin is decent, but it pale in comparison to #1 and #89. The Boiled Fish with Green Pepper Sauce 藤椒魚 is listed as being spicy, but it has a nice flavor and was not overwhelmingly spicy (we asked them to not make it too spicy), and it was a great recommendation from our waiter.Overall, for a place that has probably not been opened for more than a few days in Las Vegas, I can already predict that it will be a major success story. The food is good to "shut up and take my money" good.  Servers are busy with the number of tables they have to wait on, but they did an admirable job of it.Menu price is higher than expected, but with the superior execution of the dish it can easily be justified.  Plus the whole time we dine here, it is clear that the restaurant is packed only with super informed Asians (mainly Chinese) patrons, a major indicator of superiorness. I highly recommend that you all come and check them out, but preferably after I am sick of dining here (after about two month) or after I am already seated at our table and waiting for our food.So keep it on the DL. Only share this wonderful recommendation with your dearest friend or the one you intend to marry. Otherwise everyone will have an hour wait just like the people visiting their Alhambra and Rosemead locations.So hush x4.

Chicken wings are one of my "secret" cravings - I'll usually prefer them to other foods they're associated with (aka pizza). A good chicken wing, however, is hard to find as there's not a balance between the chicken and the sauce. It's quite a statement to proclaim that an establishment serves "the original Buffalo Chicken Wing (tm)", and "the best wings in the world". Anchor Bar continues the tradition of East Coast favorite chains first finding their foot on the West Coast (Shake Shack, White Castle). They are located in the Grand Canal Shoppes Food Court inside Venetian|Palazzo. They have limited seating in the actual counter but there's plenty of seating in the food court. When the No1DP and I were there they had samples of their boneless wings.I got the Original Anchor Bar (Buffalo) Wing (medium spicy) with seasoned smoky chipotle fries and a Pepsi ($14.50).- Portion size was big enough for two people. Unlike chicken wings I've eaten that comes as a traditional side for pizza or sold in grocery stores, each chicken wing was a fatty mini drumstick. The No1DP said that had he known the portion size was that big he would've been happy to share my combo.- Anchor Bar is the only business to do a chicken wing right, equal portion of crispy chicken wing skin and sauce. Usually a chicken overwhelmed with sauce is trying to hide the quality of the chicken. Each chicken wing was cooked properly.- Celery sticks were thin but crisp.- The bleu cheese sauce isn't strong and is made to complement the wings, celery sticks and fries.- Fries, though adequately portioned, needed to be more crispy. This is the reason for the -1 star.I had over half my food left so I gave it to two homeless guys camping out in the bridge that connects the Palazzo to the Wynn. They looked like they needed food more than we did.If split between two people it comes to around $7.25/person so I would recommend this as a suitable cheap yet delicious lunch/dinner option in the Strip. They also serve other flavors of bone-in, boneless wings, salads and sandwiches for people who want to make their meals more interesting.

You should try Pints on Penn! You haven't tried Pints on Penn because you didn't know it existed but now you do...so try Pints on Penn!They have a nice variety of beer, which is not for me but my eating partner was very satisfied. I thought the beer cocktails were really cool and I would have tried one if I didn't get obsessed with the Watermelon Ginger drink! It had fresh watermelon and ginger beer. It was really great.We order 3 apps that were really good!Brown Sugar Bacon- 5 fat strips of bacon all covered in brown sugar with a mapley cayenne dipping sauce= win!Stuffed zucchini- super fresh veggirs stuffed a home grown zuke. It was topped in cheese snd served with marinara. It was good but I wanted some sausage stuffed in there!Stffed avocados- This was my fav! The avocado was grilled and stuffed with a corn salsa. The ingredients were supper fresh and the chips were homemade. I loved!We didnt get a chance.ro try the entrees. During HH, the apps are $2 off and beer is $1 off!My friend saw this place on Groupon & we knew we had to check it out. Anything with "pints" in the title intrigues me, haha. They also are new- only open a couple months, so we were excited to go. We went on a Monday night- found parking easily on the street & it wasn't very crowded inside. There were 5 of us & we found a spot easily on the second level of the restaurant. Our server was very nice & attentive to us the entire evening. Their draft list was decent in size- I went with a fruity IPA, it was delicious. They had beer cocktails, which was awesome. My friend ordered a beer that came with a smoked jalapeno inside (it was in the drink menu- the drink will be different depending on what porter they have on draft at the time). He loved it.For appetizers we ordered the Spicy Sausage-Stuffed Apple, Spicy Chicken Nachos & Fried Pickle Chips. The Spicy Sausage-Stuffed Apple was our favorite. It was everything fall in a delicious appetizer. It wasn't too spicy but it was very flavorful & delicious. The Spicy Chicken Nachos were also a hit- they weren't super spicy but they were delicious. The fresh avocado on top was the perfect addition to the chips, chicken & cheese sauce with Pico. On their own, the chips were a little too salty, but overall we really liked this appetizer. The Fried Pickle Chips really weren't anything special. They were good- but not really memorable. My boyfriend & I weren't too crazy about the Guinness mustard that came with them- we enjoyed dipping them in ranch instead. Monday night is wing night- so three of us ordered some wings. For 50 cents each we couldn't pass up the chance to try some of their wing flavors! We ordered: 5 spicy dry rub, 5 hot pepper jam & 5 of the special that evening (honey spicy BBQ I believe?). The dry rub were good- definitely tasty. The hot pepper jam wings were a little disappointing. The jam didn't stick to the wings & therefore they were a little tasteless. They also weren't spicy at all- they were really sweet. The flavor that was on special that evening were the BEST. Super good.For our sandwiches, our group ordered: the stuffed meatball burger, the city chicken sandwich, two grilled southwest chicken wraps and the roasted turkey club with house bacon.My friend who ordered the stuff meatball burger LOVED it. Mozzarella cheese was literally dripping from the burger- it looked Awesome. I had the opportunity to try the city chicken sandwich (PORK for anyone who doesn't know what city chicken is)- it was definitely really yummy. It was also huge and my friend couldn't finish it. The two peeps that ordered the grilled southwest chicken wraps seemed to enjoy them as well. But I have to say that I ordered the best sandwich... the roasted turkey club with house candied bacon was IN-sane. It was HUGE. Thick slices of real turkey breast, thick slices of house candied delicious bacon LOADED high. This thing was a building basically. The flavor did not disappoint at all either. I was only able to eat 1/3 of it that evening. My boyfriend & I ended up splitting the remainder of the sandwich into two sandwiches & had that for dinner two days later.. so this one sandwich literally was 3 meals.. it's that big. One bummer about the sandwiches is that they all come with fries- they don't have other sides available. My friend did ask to switch her fries out for a salad- which was a $2 upcharge (not bad). The fries weren't super good- we ended up eating some for leftovers but then just throwing the rest out.Overall this place was awesome- I would really like to return for the turkey club in the future, as well as a cold beer to go with it.Check this place out asap!

Review Text :
Not Very GoodThe staff at Kingbertos Mexican Food are warm, friendly, and extremely accommodating, which is why I feel terrible for calling out their Mexican food as bland. I really wanted to like Kingbertos  so badly, especially after reading so many positive reviews. However, the food in my opinion just isn't good.This was my first visit to Kingbertos Mexican Food Restaurant, and for me the food  just isn't good. On this visit  I choose the shredded beef taco, tostada, Refried Beans, and Mexican Rice, both of which had very little taste.  In fact the refried bean almost had a somewhat grey appearance, and the shredded beef was very greasy.  The meal was just very disappointing.Kingbertos isn't the worst but I'm not in a rush to visit again

Review Text :
Move over KFC! This is the new "finger licking good"! This is the place to be when I want to get down and dirty!Smokin Crawfish is the newbie on the block. Their signature spices just made my palette crave for more of their "Smokin Style" seasoning which contains all of their spices in one A-M-A-Z-I-N-G flavor! The right touch of sweetness, garlic, and spices makes this the "WOW" factor for me! The "Garlic Butter" is another must try! Don't let the name fool you! It's unlike any other garlic butter! This place definitely has the edge over other competitors for me. The friendly atmosphere and great food surely made a lasting impression! It's across the plaza from Hot and Juicy Crawfish in the intersection of Decatur and Spring Mountain.Smokin' Crawfish, You've earned my 5 stars!I thought the reviews were too good to be true but it lived up to its expectations! It's almost like boiling crab but the sauce is slightly different and the menu has more items here. It wasn't busy at all on a Sunday lunch and I honestly hope it's doesn't get busy like boiling crab. They have combos here to choose from and it's pretty reasonably priced. My boyfriend and I decided to do al la crate because I can literally eat 3 lbs of crawfish to myself and the combo didn't let you pick two of the same seafood. I ordered 3 lbs of crawfish and a Dungeness! We got the level spicy and It's honestly not THAT spicy if you can take heat. Im going to get smokin next time. The crawfish was pretty good frozen and they cooked my boyfriends crab perfect! When you cracked the shell, the meat still kept its shape! The sauce is really rich and buttery too! It's less oily than boiling crab which is a plus for me. Oh and the side of rice is pretty big. So I suggest you share it between two people. We also ordered calamari and it was okay. It was a little too salty for me and the meat was little. Other than that, I love this place! A great new addition to Vegas.Glad to have another crawfish boil spot in town! Location is in an awkward corner of a plaza, but interior is nicely decorated with a seaside theme- I like their entryway, and their lobster-claw-catch game. Plus they have beer and sake, as well as a few TVs to watch a game while you're there.We had a pound each of shrimp and crawfish, with potatoes, sausage, and corn, in their Smokin' Sauce (a combination of all of their seasonings), at medium heat. Their heat scale is a bit more relaxed than other places, but the flavors were good. Crawfish and shrimp were nicely sized, but I really liked their fried softshell crab basket the most- perfectly cooked, nicely crisp and seasoned crab, over a generous bed of Cajun fries, for $12. Huge dinner for two, total with tax under $50.TIP: they offer 10% off during their grand opening with Yelp check in- but only Mon-Wed, between noon and 4PM, so pop in for a weekday lunch if you want to save a few bucks, but their pricing is fair compared to other spots in town.I eat crawfish & crab at least 3 times a week and this place is by far the best. The crawfish for $8 a pound is beyond a good deal. They were of good quality & the 4 flavors were very good. I was actually surprised the food was so good. We also had soft shell crab, oysters, catfish & crab legs. Beer selection was good also.Our waitress was a new trainee, but i couldnt tell. She was very friendly, eager & knowledgeable. She checked on us often. Hopefully she remembers us when we go back.

I try to wait at least a month before trying a new restaurant so that their kinks can be worked out. After reading all of the great reviews I decided to take a chance on Base Pizzeria, and I'm very glad that I did! My husband and I came here for dinner last night and were instantly welcomed by the owner as we walked through the door. The owners were so friendly, engaging and nice! They're very passionate about their business and it shows. The menu consists of mostly pizza, salad, a few appetizers and they have a variety of wine, bottled beer and spirits from Arizona Distilling Company. Everything they have is organic and locally sourced. I always love being able to support local!We chose the crispy proscuitto salad and the El Diablo pizza with a Pinot Noir for me and a Kellerweiss for my husband. I had ordered the Pinot Noir on the menu board, but was also given a taste of a bottle which they already had open. I ended up liking the tasting better than the one I had ordered, and will keep that in mind for next time. It was great that they had offered it to me so I could discover something new. The salad and pizza arrived quickly and both were fresh and wonderfully flavored. The proscuitto on the salad was crisped to perfection almost like a super thin bacon, all of the veggies were fresh and the strawberry balsamic vinaigrette had just the right bite. The El Diablo pizza had a slightly sweet hand crushed tomato sauce, which was very light and tasted of perfectly ripened tomatoes. The sopressata was delicate on spice, just enough to not overpower any of the other flavors. High quality Kalamata olives and roasted peppers made for a well-rounded dish. I would not hesitate to order either of these again.In a neighborhood with tons of pizza options available you would think that they would have some stiff competition. With the high quality organic ingredients that they're using, incredibly welcoming service and delicious food, Base Pizzeria is a step above the rest. I have no worries that they'll be successful and I can't wait to try the rest of the menu. Props to them for putting together such a well-oiled machine in such a short amount of time.

Restaurant name  Fuku Burger

Review Text :
I must admit, I was excited for Fukuburger to open in my favorite part of town. Having been to their truck at First Friday and waiting over two hours for a burger, I no longer had to stand awkwardly in a crowd of hippies and deal with the ridiculous wait. ATMOSPHERESuper hip with loud ratchet music LOL Vibe resembled a lot like the atmosphere of First Friday. The artwork displayed here were definitely the highlight. Four LED displays above the counter featured their menu as well as some cool videos. SERVICENot much to say about this department. I tipped them anyways and everyone yelled "Tip Jelly!" , then gave me a jelly. You also get to choose your funny nickname just like how it's done at the truck. Don't ask what mine was. FOODThis is where I questioned myself whether to give three or four stars. I ordered the Buta Burger which is my usual order at Fukuburger. Juicy, mouth-watering beef patty with bacon, cheese, onions and red ginger. I did enjoy my burger. However, for a burger that is as small as my fist (and I have a small hand), its $7.99 price tag is not cute. I remember paying $5 at the truck and it was the same exact portion. Please do keep in mind, I have been to Bachi Burger and have no problem paying $12-26 for a burger because given the quality and portion, the price is justifiable. If you are going to charge $8, at least give bigger portion than the truck. Burger is good, just not worth $8 for such a tiny burger. In addition, $2.10 for a small drink. Am I at Disneyland? CONCLUSIONCome here for the atmosphere and amazing burger but prepare to pay around $10 and leave hungry.Fuku has been a local food truck favorite- and I've enjoyed their food. One of the perks to their new brick in mortar location (besides being convenient to me!) is that their food quality is consistent and their service has improved. The location also offers free wifi, as well as fun music and videos playing for entertainment while you wait.While their Buta Burger is still my favorite- always juicy, plenty of flavor!- the Naga dog is also a solid option. However, a flaw I've noticed with both is the bread. The burger buns are bulk-purchase and don't stand out, and tend to fall apart. I'd prefer a sturdier version (maybe an onion bun?), the King's Hawaiian buns would be a really great option, especially for the hotdog.I'm a little disappointed to see that the pricing is still a bit high- $8 for a burger is fair, adding $5 for a drink and fries is steep, and $9 for the (admittedly generously-sized) Naga dog is higher than several local specialty hotdog spots price theirs. I guess I expect slightly inflated pricing for food trucks, but to see the same prices here as at their Strip location was unexpected.

Items Selected:Pumpkin CheesecakeThe KingRaised and GlazedApple FritterCrodoughHoley Moley! Donut Holes (Red Velvet and Classic)Located in the recently opened Pawn Plaza, a sort-off "Container Park" concept on South Las Vegas Boulevard near to the Shop that spawned the Show that launched the musical (that bombed) and countless other concepts comprising the Brand, it was midday Friday that a stop was made at Pawn Donut and Coffee, and with friendly attendants offering contests and coupons in the free lot a quick perusal of other eateries showed a number of familiar faces, a familiarity that actually spills over to both the fried carbohydrates and coffee roasted by Illy.Admitting a bit of predilection to the pastry our country has always defined as a breakfast treat but only  recently rediscovered as something worthy of more artistry and attention to detail, it does not take more than a quick perusal of the PD&C website to realize the work is eerily similar to Pink Box or Donut Mania, the later actually producing the goods at owner Ralph Cautela's request as he feels their donuts are the best in The Valley.Not particularly wowed by my lone visit to Donut Mania, the pastries themselves good enough but off-put by the owner accosting me at the door for simply snapping an exterior photo before explaining himself and telling his story, suffice it to say that options are a bit more limited at the Pawn Plaza outlet while the nod definitely goes their way for smiling service and outdoor seating, though certainly not for  pricing.Acknowledging the address + fame-based up-sell, though still not thrilled to spend nearly $15 for six selections ranging from $1.50 Classics to $3 for 5 Donut Holes and a $2.50 Special, it was with each item bagged individually that way was made to the patio for indulgence, first bites of the cake-style red velvet a bit light in cocoa while the white version tasted like a top-tier old fashioned with great texture to the dough.Onward to the brioche style of yeasted donuts made popular at Pink Box, though supposedly developed by Wayne at Donut Mania, a Raised and Glazed ring next proved pillowy and delicious while the layers of lamination beneath a sugary lacquer placed the much improved alt-named hybrid on par with ACE on Tropicana or Press at The Four Seasons amongst the best textured in the country.Unfortunately finding the seasonal filled donut to be far too much cream cheese and not enough spice or pumpkin puree, it was in two more successful selections that the not-so-modest snack concluded, the fritter well constructed with lots of apples and crispy edges in the soft-centered East Coast style while The King somehow managed to balance what must have been nearly a quarter cup of peanut butter with bruleed banana and plenty of crispy bacon stuck to a dark chocolate layer on top.***Having now visited every independent doughnuttery in Las Vegas and Henderson, the results ranging from dreadful KD's to world class ACE, Pawn Donut and Coffee is a good choice for tourists and those who happen to be in the area, though locals would be better served to experience the goods from their South Durango source where each is freshy made and a quarter or two cheaper, as well.Located at the new Pawn Plaza, this coffee and donut spot is TINY! Required city signage on the wall states the maximum occupancy is THREE. Grab and go or at least take your goods outside to the provided seating. Don't forget your wallet on the counter, which will probably be empty after the prices here...Shop offers a case of fresh-made donuts in traditional flavors (sprinkle, chocolate cake, glazed), seasonal options and specialties (such as an Elvis-themed chocolate-PB-banana option, maple-bacon bars, cronuts), as well as "holey moley!" donut holes, and apple fritters- the latter of which seems to be a hit, seeing as how the three men ahead of me in line ordered them in quick succession, rendering me unable to sample them myself.Opted for a cronut, which had great texture, though unevenly-applied glaze flaked off like dandruff all over the table rather than inside each bite. I did enjoy the light sweetness. Sprinkled donut ($1.50) was very average, did not seem the freshest despite my 10AM arrival, less than 3 hours after opening. There were two flavors of donut holes available (5/$3): the chocolate was dry and flat sans any glaze (arguably the best part!), but the red velvet was nicely glazed and seemed the freshest of my sampled items, though light on the chocolate flavors.Service was friendly- my soy latte was made quickly and correctly, and they had no problem accommodating my last-minute check-in offer (2 free donut holes). Don't forget to redeem yours!

Review Text :
Edit: entrees are not "mostly above" $25. I still think they are overpriced but I must have exaggerated it to myself when I first wrote this. Whoops! I liked Avenue Bar and I like Avenue Club. To me they are entirely different and my fondness for the old restaurant doesn't detract from my enjoyment of the new one. That would be comparing apples to oranges.Ambiance is modern and festive. Would be a good spot for a celebration.Food is very good. The mussels were good and in a delicious broth. I only wish we had more bread or there was more in the broth besides mussels because I ended up trying to drink the remnants up like soup. I also enjoyed the confit chicken wings and the apple, date and bleu cheese salad.The drink menu has a lot of intriguing choices and the shrub cocktail was great. I thought the Rouge 74 (75?) was fine, but I expected a little more. Definitely want to return to try more cocktails.Service was fine. A little slow at a few points but not so bad for 8pm on a Saturday night/a new restaurant working out the kinks.My biggest complaint would be the price of the entrees. I am excited to return to try more of the shareable plates, sandwiches and salads, but I likely will never order an entree. Many are $25+. Why do all of these relatively casual restaurants in Madison, WI suddenly think they're fancy restaurants in New York City?!Brunch review + a general commentary on the interior/remodel/refresh.+ Sunday morning brunch cannot be beat - so, so solid+ Fantastic bartenders - very helpful, friendly and responsive+ Excellent bloody mary; I like mine on the spicier side, and they are happy to oblige. Housemade tomato mix is perfect consistency - not too thin, not too heavy, and very flavorful. A bit light on the "salad" (side) items, but the housemade pickles more than make-up for any other wants+ Great brunch menu that offers a little something for everyone+ Mushroom omelet was *nearly* perfect. The eggs: fluffy, light, cooked perfectly. The filing of mushrooms, onions, and chives was perfectly cooked, but lacked seasoning, and was just a tad too oily/buttery. Back-off on the fats and bump-up the salt/pepper a tad, and this would very easily be Madison's best omelet, hands down.+ Pulled Pork & Sweet Potato Hash was *outstanding*. Featured some truly divine pulled pork (moist, smoky, perfectly rubbed) with a nice sweet potato hash. Pickled onions provided just enough bite, and the two over-medium eggs that I had on top were expertly cooked (mostly set, with just a hint of runny yolk). Truly loved this.+ Sides of greens were excellent as well - fresh, bright, and nicely balanced- Coffee left a little to be desired, but was serviceableAll-in-all, this was one of my top 5 all-time best brunch experiences. I *will* return many, many more times. The bartender, the food, the drinks - all were really outstanding.Regarding the refresh of the interior: I dig the updated look and feel. It's modern while remaining true to its roots. For those who long for the old worn-out booths, dirty ceiling tiles, and tired carpet... find another dive bar/club. The Avenue did a great job of renewing itself and providing some much-needed love to some really critical areas. The new bar is fantastic, the seating is comfy, and the booths/tables pay homage to times of old and honoring the spirit of the old Avenue. I'm a fan. I don't miss the old stuff one little bit.

We had a late, light dinner here tonight.  It was recommended by our B&B host and is an easy block and a half walk.  The building is old and the décor is charming and eclectic.  The room you enter has the bar and it's noisier than the room to the left.  We were greeted warmly and given our choice of tables.  We chose the quieter room.  Tables are covered w/ butcher paper.  There's a bilingual menu and the table d'hôte is on a blackboard.  Many things looked good, but we weren't hungry enough for anything major.  Alan chose the smoked salmon entrée (entrée here is an appetizer at home).  Our hostess was concerned that it wouldn't be enough for him.  I chose a four cheese sandwich w/ tomato and pesto.  It was heated but not grilled as a panini is.  It came w/ a choice of fries or salad and I chose the latter.  Both salad and sandwich were tasty.  Alan was pleased w/ his salmon.  He had bites of the salad and of the sandwich, so we both had enough food because I wasn't as hungry as he was.  We both had water to drink.  Service was friendly and accommodating and the food hit the spot.  3.51, rounded up.

I stopped in a few weeks ago and ordered a half loaded potato skin and a half meaty Italiano minus olives pizza ($7.99), and had a San Tan Oktoberfest ($4.39) to wash it all down.  Right away I was greeted by the employees and I really like the interior.  They did a nice job.  It's funky and interesting.  They have a fantastic selection of local brews and wine to choose from as well, and the pizza combinations on the wall of fame are very creative.  I saw several I want to try.  Of course you can also build your own.The potato skin pizza had intrigued me when I looked at their menu online, and living up to its name, it does taste like potato skins which goes GREAT with the beer.  The meaty Italiano half was very good as well, with lots of good quality meats.  I just didn't care for the crust.  It's a nice thickness, but totally bland.  I read the other reviews and the owner's comment about why they use the conveyor ovens.  That makes sense.  I just miss some kind of garlicky or buttery or seasoned flavor in the crust if it's not going to have that brick oven flavor and char.  Thankfully the toppings are all excellent and kind of overcompensate for the crust.  I enjoyed my first visit and my husband really enjoyed the leftovers.  I will definitely be back.

I went in today w/ my brother. My brother and I had the vegan plate, no meat, no dairy, no animal byproducts whatsoever. It was exactly what I wanted. The plate was big and it was perfect for two people the share. The bread is called teff that's has been in Ethiopia for over 3,00 years (the server informed us). He also informed us that it was high in fiber and iron. I also did some research and found that it was very high in protein as well. I love that they have vegan options, that they use olive oil, and that the customer service was excellent. Also, for the gluten-free lifestyle, they can certainly accommodate toC starting w/ teff.The veggie combo I got here has the unfortunate distinction of being both the skimpiest and the priciest I've ever been served, and I've ordered them in 11 cities and four time zones. My first thought when it was served was, "Wait ... is that an appetizer?" My plate came with the requisite lentils and cabbage, as well as pureed potatoes in place of the customary solid ones. The two problems with the servings: their size, given that the plate they were served on was largely injera, and a lack of variety. I'd been hoping for greens and yellow split peas, which commonly come with vegetarian combos along with salad greens. I was tempted to order kitfo -- raw beef -- to fill out my plate but took comfort in the fact that at least my bill likely would be small. Surely, a veggie combo that's half the size of some I've been served elsewhere would be half the price, right? Quite the contrary; my bill was more than $14 for about $7 worth of food.The restaurant's atmosphere is a saving grace; it's bright and inviting. There's free Wi-Fi; you just have to ask an employee for the password. And while I've had to work to get employees' attention at some other Ethiopian restaurants, that wasn't the case here. People were quite friendly. Based on some other reviewers' pics, perhaps visiting here as part of a group results in getting more food and better variety. But if your solo experience is anything like mine was, the results will be underwhelming for both your palate and your pocketbook.

Review Text :
Sometimes, you don't need a picture to support a review of a business that's really good. Or at least that's my story after another phone battery outage during a restaurant visit...(Sorry about that. I did get some photos courtesy of a friend who finally made time for lunch during a return visit to Vegas, I was originally going to introduce him to a certain new sushi burrito place but our mutual local buddy said that we should try this new place downtown called The Smashed Pig. I can be a bit of a sucker for brand-new places these days, so I agreed.)(Oh, and that sushi note? Interestingly, Nobu Matsuhisa-trained chefs Linda Rodriguez and Martin Swift formerly ran a Red Rock Resort restaurant called Hachi, no relation to the new Hachi on Jones near Spring Mountain. That explains some of the Japanese influence in a simple one-page food menu otherwise easily mistaken for that of a British pub.)This self-proclaimed gastropub opened a couple weeks ago in a former tattoo parlor, which is just a hop, skip, and a jump away from Las Vegas Blvd. Interestingly, they're only open 2-11pm on the weekends right now. As I recall, the bartender/server mentioned that morning traffic has been slow on the weekends in this cold season. That all said, we were fortunate to arrive after opening, and we seated ourselves at the bar after being told that the restaurant section would be unavailable until the server's scheduled start time at around 4.I could go on and on about the comfortable atmosphere and the bartender's menu knowledge and friendliness, but let's get to the food already.French Bean Tempura ($7): wholly ordered off the bartender's recommendation. She called it "crack," and I can't disagree. It's pretty straightforward tempura with chipotle mayo and toasted almond slivers, but I could hardly stop eating it. I'd get it next time in a heartbeat.Lamb "Tacos" ($9): not the most beautiful colors ever seen in a dish, but a nice spice profile somewhere in the vicinity of the Middle East or India, some serviceable sour cream, an sweet pepper chutney that's addictive on its own, and a crispy eggplant that substitutes for a hard shell. Overall, another fantastic appetizer. I considered ordering a second helping, but I wanted to try other items instead.Crispy Deviled Eggs ($8): served with cornichons (tart, mildly sweet pickle) and dusted w/ paprika. Lacked the oomph of the other two appetizers, especially in the hard boiled white. It's good, but not exceptional.(I skipped the $3-a-piece oysters based on the bartender's description of their small/medium size,  verified by my observation, and they weren't particularly impressive per my friend.)The Smashed Pig Burger ($14): seems like all beef to me, ironically. Ordered medium and without cheddar (+$1) per my visiting friend. It's served with sea salt garlic fries, which may be a tad underseasoned and not so potent in garlic but are otherwise perfectly textured (you know, the whole crispy/fluffy thing) and go well with either ketchup or the burger sauce (a mixture of ketchup, mayo, sriracha, and a sauce whose name escaped the 'tender but may be the "HP" brown sauce). This sauce really helps out the burger too, which is not great until the sauce is added.Fish and Chips ($16): two large cod fillets with tartar, hot mushy peas (not joking, almost burned my fingers), and malt vinegar. I have had much less experience with fish and chips than I'd like, but even if this dish isn't done the proper way, it's done the right way. You can't go wrong with really moist fish inside a crispy batter, and all the condiments work, including the very palatable peas. Oh, and the same fries from earlier serve as the chips here. Maybe a little pricey, but I was happy enough even if my wallet wasn't.Sticky Toffee Pudding ($5): this was somehow at least as wonderful as the toffee pudding that I recently tried at the now-closed David Clawson Restaurant. This moist, delicious cake topped with whipped cream and a caramel sauce that's less viscous that anticipated is, dare I suggest it, destination-worthy. It was certainly a worthy end to a marvelous mealWhile the gastropub experience might be considered incomplete without particular beverages, I abstained from alcohol due to DD duties. I will note that my friends seemed to enjoy the canned craft beers, such as the Back Home gingerbread stout. Maybe I'll try it next time, or I could pick a beer pairing specific to each menu item.With a disclaimer that I haven't visited nearly all of the other Downtown Las Vegas restaurants, I currently can't recommend another nearby restaurant over The Smashed Pig. I'd say that Carson Kitchen (NOTE: based on an old visit) isn't as good, and Park on Fremont across the street should just shut down now and save themselves the agonizing death. Whether you want a full meal or a quick bite, you should definitely stop here the next time you're in DTLV. Better yet, make this the focal point of your visit."This is a poor man's Carson Kitchen," my boyfriend groused, as he paid our $40 bill for four great-sounding apps that failed to wow us. I expedited my visit here based on a friend's recent rave review (Chris V), and ordered several similar dishes, only to find most options underseasoned with a better version merely on the other side of the block.FRENCH GREEN BEANS: Tempura beans with spicy mayo and toasted almonds. I like the cooking method and these were solid, and admirably light on grease. But the nearby CK has a larger portion with a great dipping sauce that this version can't hold a candle to.TODAY'S SASHIMI/TARTARE (TUNA POKE): This was just okay. Poke was oddly seasoned with large chunks of onion and a lot of spice, rather than the citrus-garlic-ponzu punch I'd been anticipating. It was really fresh though.LAMB TACOS: The dish I was most anticipating, with a clever concept of crafting a taco shell from fried eggplant. I really enjoyed the sweet pepper chutney, which was reminiscent of a ratatouille. But the lamb itself lacked the familiar, meaty flavor. Seemed to lack any sort of seasoning whatsoever.CRISPY DEVILED EGGS: A fried egg white with nicely fried crispy texture, topped with a bland but creamy egg yolk filling, and entirely too much paprika. I had anticipated a version similar to a Thai hard-boiled egg, yielding a barely-cooked yolk. This just didn't work for me. Other that the paprika, there wasn't much going on... and for $8/4 pieces, CK's version with caviar is the better option.I was dying to try their sticky toffee pudding, but my BF refused to order anything else and experience additional frustration. Around this time, our server disappeared for a solid 20 minutes and eventually the super-sweet food runner settled our bill for us. This spot has great decor and the menu all sounds like food I'd love, but the execution and/or consistency are just not there at this time- perhaps Chris and I had different chefs working on our visits? I'm too hopeful not to give them another try sooner or later, but right now I'm underwhelmed.

I really hope this place stays around for a long time.I was hungry for dinner and i clicked on my Yelp app and this place had great reviews and had what i wanted, which at the moment was tacos!The really unique thing about this place is that all the meats are cooked in a smoker which adds an added layer of flavor to your typical taco meat. I asked for the 3 taco special which included rice and beans.  I had smoked chicken, smoked pork and smoked beef.  they were all pretty good!The salsa bar is one of things you need to try. The salsa that stands out is an orange colored salsa that has some bite, and tastes like nothing I've had before.I'ts good, you need to get some. . The other salsas were also very good and I'll have to go back and try some different ones. They have a good selection of meat, pretty much anything you want and many items on the menu that I have yet to check out, Overall this is a great spot with people that care about the food they make. I'll be back for more

I know, it's a seafood restaurant and I didn't order seafood- what was I thinking?!  I personally dislike how "market price" is listed for nearly every dish in the category, but found a bunch of other tasty items to try. Dishes are made quick and served family-style.HOUSE SOUP: Gratis with meal, on the plain side, mostly broth with hints of ginger. Much appreciated to warm us up on our 40-degree evening.SCALLION PANCAKES: Four-piece order, delicate and light with a nicely crisp exterior. These complemented our heartier entrees nicely.LAMB AND LEEK: So good! Plenty of leeks and green onion, generous and tender portion of lamb, definitely something I would get again! "EGGPLANT WITH GROUND PORK": I assume there was a miscommunication because my dish had eggplant but no pork, but it was still good. Soft chunks of eggplant, a rich dark sauce, bits of ginger and red pepper everywhere. HOUSE DESSERT: Black sticky rice, date, and red bean soup, allegedly good for circulation, balanced flavor but not to my BF's liking. Service was shockingly good- I'm used to receiving the bare minimum at most places on Spring Mountain, but here we were checked up on regularly by several staff members. Pricing was reasonable, the above was just over $30 with tip. I will be coming back to try the seafood items or clay pot dishes.

I checked out the Nook during a friends and family soft opening. I visited the location in Osseo many years ago, and it's great to have one just around the corner in De Fo--although my waistline will beg to differ! The interior is very welcoming, with homey, slightly kitschy Norwegian decor. More impressive is what greets you right when you walk in the door: the carb-o-licious behemoth that is the bakery case. There are some kinks yet to iron out--really not worth mentioning at this juncture because that IS the purpose of a soft opening. As for the food: it took quite some time for my party to settle on what they wanted, with much flipping from front to back of then menu, and then back again. The Ruben sandwich on pumpernickel was filled with flavorful corned beef, and the bread was excellent. I have to admit that I ordered the Lefse wrap with Swedish meatballs and mashed potatoes because I hadn't tried anything like it before, and it tickled a wild hair. Now that I have had that experience, I likely would not repeat it. It wasn't bad; just really not my thing, as it turned out. The burgers and other sandwiches looked great, so maybe I'll take the less exotic route next time. We capped off our meal with a slice of pie, which was a rich, decadent little piece of heaven. Overall, I have positive feelings about this place and will be interested to see how it develops after the official opening.

Review Text :
This place is going to be the next Robertos of sushi! I've seen this concept done in SF and LA but they have a unique twist by incorporating a few subtle Mexican flavors.  Most of the other places have been pretty much just Japanese flavors.  I'm always a fan of fresh ingredients that I can pick up on the go.  Definitely healthier options than your normal fast food or burrito options.  Pretty much all the basic sushi roll ingredients you can think of(salmon, tuna, shrimp tempura, egg, crab salad)...I would like to see them put eel into the mix as well in the future. And for the non seafood eaters, they have chicken and steak. I like that they have tons of fresh veggies you can add and seaweed salad.  The tortilla chip option also gives it a nice crunch to the rolls.  They also have chips, I wish they had a wonton chip nachos with a mix of fishes/crab, eel sauce, etc.  Lol....if the owner is reading this...I've been dreaming of a place that would serve nachos like the ones at Samurai Burrito in Fountain Valley, CA ;). They were quite the money maker there...I have no doubt it would be similar in Vegas.  They have a plethora of interesting unique sauces to pair with all the rolls.  They also have a thicker house made soy perfect for topping the burritos, as well as the normal pico de gallo, salsas, wasabi and ginger. Quick service, large burritos, reasonable prices!  This is truly fast food sushi heaven.SUSHI BURRITOS IN VEGAS UGH YES FINALLY.I may have gotten a little too hyped for this place, which means my expectations were a little bit higher than usual... The staff was friendly, but I had to wait 25-30 minutes until I could finally order. I kept in mind that there were new hires who were working the assembly line, so it was understandable.Redondo - 3/5 // $12.95The first thought that came into my mind as they were making my sushi burrito was "that's all the rice they put on it? Really?" I thought there'd be at least a little bit more rice to make up for the lightness of the fish and toppings. The quality of the fish was pretty good considering the fact that we don't live by the coast. All the other toppings felt like they were a little bit skimped on and there was supposed to be Chipotle Mayo sauce, but I barely tasted any in mine. Overall, there was't really much flavor to it and it didn't really fill me up, which was a little disappointing (and I have a small stomach tbh). My friend told me that I could have gotten sauces on the side, which is what I should've done! Next time, next time...Other than the food, the atmosphere is refreshing with its white, open space. I got my order to-go, so I didn't really get to bask in the restaurant. When coming here, keep in mind that there may be a line... because there will probably be a few first timers who will take forever choosing which toppings to put on their sushi burrito.I'll have to try the taro chips and maybe one of the juices next time, but I probably won't be going back any time soon since I won't be dying to have another sushi burrito again.First time trying sushi burrito and I wasn't too impressed. Having been raised in Japan, I grew up eating something similar but under a different name. It is called temakizushi (手巻き寿司), a Japanese customized hand-roll. In my opinion, sushi burrito is just more creative name for a customized hand-roll. SERVICETheir "assembly line" was disorganized and inefficient. I understand they just opened last week but I saw one guy grabbing something over another guy's arm. Then a new hire looking through recipe getting in the way of another guy. They should take some notes from Subway and learn to run the line smoothly. 3 people in front of me and I waited over 20 mins to order. Meh.FOODI ordered Mission ($8.95) which comes with salmon, sushi ebi, cream cheese, pico de gallo, tortilla strips, romaine lettuce, yuzu guacamole and tomatillo shiso sauce. Took out the pico de gallo since I can't handle any heat. There's definitely some texture, but it had absolutely no flavor. Tortilla strips gave some nice crunch and I liked how they are generous with salmon and ebi. However, even with their yuzu guacamole and tomatillo shiso sauce, a quick dip in soy sauce was necessary. Odd that I only tasted yuzu guacamole on one half of my sushi burrito. Put more sauce please. You can totally customize your own in bowl, burrito or nachos. Choose your toppings, protein and sauces. Will try this next time.CONCLUSIONI paid around $10 (tax and tip included) for a burrito that wasn't filling. Maybe I would've enjoyed my experience more if I didn't wait for so long. I will give another chance in the future but 3 stars for now.Sushi roll, burrito-style.This fusion concept has made it's way from the Bay Area down to SoCal, across the desert to Vegas! The hardest decision: do you want a burrito, bowl (think poke-style/rice bowl) or nachos (aka Jachos)? I was on my way to McCarren so I went with a burrito as the most logical vessel for a grab-and-go situation.You are able to either pick one of Jaburritos' own creations (named after different seaside locations) or customize your own sushi burrito.  Burritos come wrapped up in either traditional nori (seaweed), flour tortilla, or for carb conscious folks there's soy paper!I opted for a custom burrito. Why? Because I've got old lady eyes and I could simply not be bothered with squinting to read the menu board and messing up my RBF in the process, plus you can't beat ordering your food Chipotle-style.Need help? The friendly staff can help come up with a tasty concoction without judging you for adding all those extra proteins, extra toppings, extra sauces, etc. because beach club season is over now.But let's be real here.... I wouldn't really call this a burrito, it's more of an oversized temaki-style sushi. All in all, I enjoyed my experience here and Jaburritos will be one of the options for food when I'm back in the area and need a quick bite to eat. The sushi burritos were pretty filling (I only added one extra protein serving this time) and the ingredients were all fresh, backed by a reasonable price.  We spent about $25.50 before tip for 2 burritos, 2 drinks and a side order of taro chips with cheese.Pro-tip: opt for the taro chips as your side, or base for the Jachos vs boring tortilla chips.Went on Saturday 10-17-15 around 4:30 PM with my new yelp friend Jamie P.  This restaurant is located in a small shopping center on Sahara just west of the 15.  David's Bridal, McDonalds, and Landry's are in the same area.  The line is set up kinda like Subway...you pick whether you want nachos, a burrito, a bowl, or a salad, and then you can choose between their signature burritos or build your own.  I got the redondo which is Ahi Tuna, Salmon, Yellowtail, Cucumber, Tobiko, Guacamole, Red Onion, Tortilla Strips, Jalapeno, Cream Cheese, Lettuce, Avocado, Cilantro, Wasabi Mayo, with Soy Paper ($11.84 after tax).They have an awesome machine that rolls the rice onto the nori/soy paper.  A sushi machine! Never seen one before.  Fancy-schmancy.  Honestly, I don't even know how to review this place because...well...I don't like sushi.  THERE.  I SAID IT.  I've tried, really.   I want to like it so bad because it's to beautiful and hip!     Like Manami S. noted, the assembly line was chaotic, with the guys reaching over each other and reading the recipes off a piece of paper.  The same guy asked me twice about somebody else's burrito, then the cashier tried to charge me for the person behind me.  My burrito was missing the cream cheese and the onion.  Mildly irritating but understandable in their first few weeks of opening. The place was crowded and there's only seating for maybe 20 people so we took our burritos over to McDonalds and ate them.  I got about five bites in before I gave up and gave my other half to my new friend.  If I ever go back, I'll stick to the white girl options like the waikiki (chicken) or the boardwalk(steak).Hot and new, Jaburritos lived up to the hype on our first visit for dinner last night.  I created my own Jachos with taro chips, ebi shrimp, crab, guacamole, pico de gallo, and had the nacho cheese on the side.  Wow, those taro chips are amazeballs!  I could have eaten another serving and plan to very soon.The b/f created his own Jaburrito with salmon, ahi, brown rice, and chips and was also tempted to get another creation, but the line became super long as we were eating our first go-round.  Word is definitely out on this place.Sometimes new spots disappoint because those expectations become unreasonably high, but Jaburritos did not; we'll definitely be back sooner than later.*TIPS:Our party of six arrived around 6:15pm on Tuesday night and we were lucky enough to snag a table for all of us.  However, it wasn't too long before the place got packed.  It's new, so patience is key.  Check out the menu online so you have an idea of what you'd like to create or try one of their own Jaburritos.It's an American sized sushi roll.Jaburritos isn't a new idea; it's just new to Vegas. There are a few locations on the Western side of the U.S. that serve this style of enormous sushi roll. Yes, this is sushi and not a burrito, but "Jaburritos" sounds better than, "Large Sized Sushi Roll Eatery", moving on... The ordering style is the "create your own" model, but they also have pre-made options to choose from for the creatively drained. This was me when I walked in, and after a brief explanation of the menu I ended up going with the Long Beach Roll; spicy tuna, shrimp tempura, surimi crab, romaine, cucumber, tortilla strips, guacamole, chipotle mayo, Anguilla sauce and a side order of Taro chips and nacho cheese. This crazy ass meal was actually very good and very filling. All the ingredients were extremely fresh, fried additions weren't overly fried, the veggies were crunchy and weirdly enough the house made salsas fit-in perfectly with the other flavors. I did have a problem with the nacho cheese on my Taro chips; it definitely came from a can. Jaburritos can be a bit pricey depending what you order, but no more than any other decent lunch place in Vegas. I would definitely come back and see what else I can jamburrito into my face.The crew that opened SOHO now has this place: sushi, in burritos, with mexican influences. I dig it! Sushi burritos on their own aren't new, the Jogasaki truck from LA rolls into town whenever we have food festivals and Sushirrito is a hit in SF, but I'm glad to see we finally have an option here- especially from a place that does it fresh, fast, and friendly.Walk up and order, Chipotle-style. Customize your creation in a wrap (soy paper, seaweed, or tortilla) or bowl, with raw fish or simply chicken/beef options. Tortilla or taro chips, edamame, and mochi are also options.The ROCKPORT is my favorite so far- soft shell crab, spicy tuna, surimi crab, jalapeno, tobiko, cucumer, red onion, chipotle mayo, and sweet anguilla sauce. Every ingredient harmonizes, would maybe add avocado or guac but it's pretty perfect as-is.The MISSION (salmon, sushi ebi, cream cheese, pico de gallo, tortilla strips, romaine, yuzu guac, and tomatillo shiso sauce) channels some south-of-the-border flavor but seemed to be missing something- maybe add a spicy element like sriracha or jalapenos to perk it up a bit.The REDONDO was runner up- packed with ingredients I love but somehow not the explosion of flavors my tastebuds had anticipated.TARO CHIPS: rather heavily seasoned with furikake (and some other stuff?), these were sweeter than expected and served with a cup of toxic-orange gas-station nacho cheese. The sweet-savory combination oddly worked, but I can't say I'd get it again. Service is super friendly. Vibe is crazy-positive. They're still in their soft-opening phase and busy as hell. This location is way more convenient to me than SOHO, so I'll probably pop by pretty often. Average price per signature 'rrito is ~$11, and they are filling. NOTE: The prices posted on the walk-up menu are a buck or two less than on their takeout menu. Is it foolish to be crossing my fingers that they don't go up?When I saw the culinary mind behind Soho in the house, my expectations grew higher. They were exceeded.I've anticipated the opening of Jaburritos ever since I heard that Chef John Chien Lee of Soho Japanese Restaurant was launching a new place. I finally got to try it when I met up with friends for an early lunch. And yes, the man himself was present, watching the front line and working around the back counter and the kitchen while still smiling to customers. How could that not be a great omen?Jaburritos is his take on the fusion of sushi and burritos. Unlike other concepts that I've tried (local AYCE joint JJANGA and LA-based food truck Jogasaki, the latter a regular sight at the twice-yearly Foodie Fest), Jaburritos actually incorporates Mexican ingredients into the burritos and provides a basic "salsa" bar to boot (mild salsa, salsa verde, and salsa roja in addition to ginger, wasabi, and house soy sauce).I like the location and the space. It's on Sahara across from Palace Station, so it's not far from the freeway. The inside is bright and welcoming with environmentally conscious decisions (full-on LED lights, anyone?) and relatively modest seating (maybe 30 people max). The line moves quickly, and it's very natural to compare the ordering experience to Chipotle because of the assembly line format, the "burrito" bowl option, the possibility of customization (although the pre-designed, beach-named menu items seem like winners), and of course the (sometimes) bagged chips available at the cashier.I decided not to look into the possibility of "jachos" (corn or taro chips topped with sushi ingredients) and I didn't feel up to making a burrito from scratch, so I went for the easy preset options. For the choices available with these, I asked for the soy paper, not the nori wrap, so as to match the presentation of the aforementioned sushi burrito purveyors. I also stuck to the white sushi rice instead of the brown rice because they stated that the latter didn't have the sushi vinegar.Taro chips with queso ($2.99 for the side order, i.e. not the combo): I must mention this first. I kept munching on this and almost ignoring the burritos because they're so addictive. The taro chips are much like the Terra packaged version except dusted with furikake. They're fun on their own, but something about the combination of the taro chips with that liquid cheese dip that makes it very tough to stop. I somehow tasted a light sweetness with the combo, and it definitely wasn't from the queso alone. Definitely make this a part of your order, whether it's the shareable-size side portion or a smaller portion in the drink combination.Rockport ($10.95): soft shell crab, spicy tuna, surimi, jalapeño, masago, cucumber, red onion, tempura crunch, chipotle mayo, sweet anguilla (eel) sauce. It's easy to point to the two powerful sauces as the reason that this has been a winner with others, but it wouldn't succeed without the other ingredients combining harmoniously. The tempura crunch is the standout of the non-sauce components. I could probably eat this all day, but I shared half with a friend in exchange for...Redondo ($10.95): ahi, salmon, yellowtail, cucumber, masago, red onion, tortilla strips, jalapeño, cilantro, wasabi mayo. It wasn't as purely fun as the Rockport, but it's almost as delicious. The fish stand out in this burrito, proving that you don't need so many sauces to have a good sushi roll. Or a good Jaburrito, one that I'd also order again.[UPDATE 11/3/15: Went again with different friends, tried the Kodiak ($8.95): grilled salmon, romaine, cream cheese, pico de gallo, tempura crunch, mango teriyaki, chipotle mayo, and furikake. It wasn't very good, and I had to keep adding flavor from soy sauce and the various salsas. Skip this, and design your own grilled salmon combo if you must.]I tried the salsas with everything. I didn't find that they significantly elevated anything (except for the lackluster Kodiak), but they weren't incompatible and provided a fun accent. The soy sauce helped the Redondo more than the sauce-laden Rockport. I skipped the ginger and wasabi since I feared unnecessarily sharp flavors, but they looked like standard fare at least.Jaburritos is a great choice for lunch or a light dinner. With fresh ingredients and solid execution, Chef Lee has proven the concept of sushi and Mexican fusion while creating the best rendition of the sushi burrito that I've had thus far. I can't wait to return to try different options and eventually make my own Jaburrito from scratch.Big ol' sushi rolls the size of your face? Yes, please. I came in during their first week and I opted for the select your own option. I chose salmon, soft shell crab, cucumber, yuzu guacamole and tobiko. The staff was new and just learning, but patience was key and they were really trying to learn.They let you try any of the sauces and add anything on the side if you prefer. I was impressed by how friendly and accommodating everyone was and I look forward to giving them another try soon. If only they were closer to home.We've got to learn to Reduce, Reuse, Recycle...Are they huge sushi rolls or somewhat small burritos?...yes, they're Jaburritos!!! What you're getting at Jaburritos is fresh, clean food you can customize to your liking. Chef John realized the good thing going on in other places like San Francisco and teamed up a sustainably minded partner to bring Vegas their first glimpse of sushi burritos...think over-stuffed sushi rolls, or hand rolls.Jaburritos is an easy win for me. Price, quality, and flavor. For about the same price as a lot of sushi rolls in town you can purchase a sushi burrito...not Philadelphia and California roll prices, but a comparable value for anyone that regularly orders sushi rolls....and JSB's are larger. You won't find some of the high-end cuts of fish that Soho and other sushi places have, but then again you wouldn't want to "waste" those cuts in a roll or a sushi burrito. What you will find is fresh, good quality fish and meat to make your sushi burrito enjoyable. One of the secrets to a great sushi burrito is the sauce. JSB might even do this better than some other sushi burrito spots. As with most sushi rolls, the sauce is where the flavor is. JSB has a lot of great Japanese sauces, salsas, salsa fusion sauces and even some Asian sauces that aren't necessarily Japanese in nature. Ex: Yuzu Guacamole?...Yes please! I would recommend Jaburritos to friends based on these reasons alone. Throw in the customization of your sushi burrito and the fact that JSB is immensely sustainable in their efforts and I find myself with a business I can really get behind!On your first visit feel free to jump right in to the create-your-own game if you have some ideas to explore before you arrive, however most would do well to check out one of their pre-determined concepts such as:Redondo - ahi tuna, salmon, yellow tail, cucumber, masago, red onion, tortilla strips, jalapeno, cilantro, wasabi mayoLong Beach - spicy tuna, shrimp tempura, surimi crab, romaine lettuce, cucumber, tortilla strips, guacamole, chipotle mayo, sweet anguilla sauceMission - salmon, sushi ebi shrimp, cream cheese, pico de gallo, tortilla strips, romaine lettuce, yuzu guacamole, tomatillo shiso sauceRockport - soft shell crab, spicy tuna, surimi crab, jalapeno, masago, cucumber, red onion, tempura crunch, chipotle mayo, sweet anguilla sauceTL;DRPricey, decent, good texture, long beach. Sushi? Love. Burritos? Love.Pick and choose style eateries? Love. Jaburritos? :(Having eaten Jaburritos 3 times now I can't say I'm a fan no matter what the hype says. It isn't terrible, its pretty decent, but so many aspects makes it a place that I wouldn't eat regularly. It isn't exactly mind blowing, and really more so a giant hand roll that isn't so giant. Smaller appetite patrons may be satisfied after one sushi burrito, but larger appetite patrons may consider getting 2, which ends up costly. Consider quickly though because the lines are tremendously slow and as the place gets busier it'll only take longer. I have been in line for at most 20 minutes, which isn't bad for a sit down, but for a pick and choose restaurant its rather slow. Lunch breakers consider ordering ahead of time.The Long Beach may be the best of the ones I've tried.The sauces are great here (my favorite is queso, weird eh?) but mask most of the flavors of the fish which seems counter intuitive if you're here to eat fish.                There is good texture though, with creamy and crunchy being most prominent. The salsa cups are paper cups but a larger variation is needed for dine in (there is 2 separate cups for dine in and take out), too small to be useful for chips. There is a variety of prices for each burrito ($6-12) but seems to be a bit expensive for the size.ATTENTION: Jaburritos is not closed, per se. They just did a name change to SOHO SushiBurrito. They're still located in the exact same location, same employees and management team. They claim they are still using the same ingredients and such but I can't comment on that since I haven't tried it for myself. Expect a new review on their SOHO SushiBurrito Yelp review page shortly.No more waiting for the Foodie Fest to be here so I can get my Jokasaki fix. We now have JABURRITOS here in town!In a nutshell, it's sushi in burrito form. Please take a moment and take a look at the many pics already posted here. It taste just as good as it looks...if not better.Our first time here, our eyes were bigger than our stomachs. We wanted to try everything to our hearts content. You can choose between soy or seaweed paper for your burritos.I ordered the Rosarito $5.25: spicy tuna, cucumbers, cabbage, tortilla chips, rice and their diablo sauce. Whooo!!!!! Just a word of caution: I LOVEEEEEE anything spicy but that diablo sauce made my lips burn. Yes, it was more of the spicier foods I've eaten in a while.....but it felt sooooo good! ;)Boyfriend ordered the Rockport $10.95: soft shell crab, spicy tuna, cucumbers, rice, tempura and chipotle mayo. He LOVED IT!!! This seemed like the more popular burrito because while waiting in line, two separate people in front of us AND one in the back of us ordered this.Then as if that wasn't enough for us, we also ordered the Long Beach: spicy tuna, shrimp tempura, crab, romaine lettuce, cucumber, tortilla strips, guacamole, chipotle mayo, sweet anguilla sauce $10.95. We split that one. This was just as delcious but we rather stick with our first choice.Only downside is the seating arrangements. Very few chairs and tables. If you come during peak hours, hope you can find a seat. No doubt this place is going to do really well so they need to sort this out somehow...someway.This is like the Chipotle of sushi rolls. You pick what form you want: rice bowl or sushi burrito. Pick a wrapper: soy paper or nori. Pick your rice: white rice or brown rice. Pick a sushi burrito concoction or create your own. Pick your sides: taro chips or edamame. Do you want extra protein? Pay extra. They also have tofu as a protein source.I tried the Kodiak with brown rice and fresh salmon. This normally has grilled salmon so, the fresh salmon was extra. The fish quality was good.The create-your-own option is neat. The combinations you can make...oh, the possibilities!The restaurant is tiny with only a few tables. I'd recommend taking your food to-go because of the lack of seating and you'll end up smelling like cooking oil. The service is great though. The price per sushi burrito is about $9. You can get tiny sushi rolls/maki from other restaurants for about $8 but a sushi burrito is roughly 2-3 times bigger than a maki.

You know?..there are plenty Mexican restaurants in town, but every now and then you you run into one that totally stands out from all the others and lucky for me this is the case with Las Tarascas Michoacanas. The food is amazingly good! The place is nice and clean with minimal decorations and although it lacks some more Mexican colors, the arches on the wall are a nice touch giving it a feel of authenticity. Service was great, this is a family owned restaurant and they really make you feel like you are part of it. They constantly check on you to refill your beverages and to make sure you're enjoying your meal to the fullest.I ordered the gallina Zamorana, thats chicken covered with a special strawberry sauce and mushrooms, something I never had before and it was delicious, specially with the freshly handmade tortillas. We also tried the enchiladas Doña Andrea and we loved them but let me warn you, this are authentic Mexican enchiladas and not the ones most people are accustomed to here on the states, so if you're a "green grow", I recommend you try the regular enchiladas.We really had a great time here at Las Tarascascas, ask for Viri (I think that was her name) she will definitely take good care of you! I can't wait to come back and try other items on the menu that sounded delicious, the only bad part is that I live so far from this place, but as my friend would say..... I usually don't hang around on this side of town but when I do I eat at Las Tarascas Michoacanas.....don't stay hungry my friends..try them!#great food#awesome service#super margaritas

Review Text :
Another welcome addition to the restaurant scene in the Burgh.  Cool place.  Nice to have some Spanish cuisine.  There are mostly highlights but a few minor things that I am sure will evolve since only open a week or so. We stopped in for a drink and some small plates. The bar is a stand up bar and limits orders from the menus of small plates, just what we wanted to try.  Morcilla cures meats in house so we decided to give them a try.  There is a small case of the many of the menu items on display at the end of bar.  The bar staff was good and friendly.  It was nice to be able to talk with the staff while they mixed sangria and some interesting drinks. We tasted a few of the wines available as a 2 oz. pour.  Not real familiar with some of the Spanish wines, so asked the bar staff for some info on a couple of the wines.  While they were helpful, I think a little more info/description would be helpful.  One was compared to a french wine but did not get a real description.  I would think this will change over time, but a little more of a description would be helpful. One of the wines tasted was probably open overnight and seemed to be a little oxidized but was drinkable.  The others were quite good. We had a couple of the Montaditos (sandwiches), the  Matrimony was terrific, the beef tartare was good but it probably had just a little to much aiolo, The Cecina of cured dried beef  and the Morcilla sausage were both excellent.  The menu includes some Jamon and seafood that we did not get to try, but will definitely come back to sample.  Will have to stop in with more time and have a dinner, too,

Review Text :
This is the second location for Pinches in Las Vegas and is completely different from the one in the downtown Container Park.  It's at the Gramercy just off the 215 at Russell Road.When you enter, you place your order at a "food truck" window.  You're given your drink there unless you're getting soda from one of the many flavors Coke machines.  You're given a table marker and you have a seat while they make your order and then bring it to your table.There was no one there at 5 PM on this Saturday night and I was able to take in the decor and get some photos of the interior.  It was designed nicely with whimsical wall paintings, faux garbage cans that have paper flowers in the top, and a kitchen in glass with wooden closures like a Mexican food place.One of the owners took my order and he chatted with me about the decor and explained the Dia de los Muertos style art done of member of the Anaya family.My meal came--a combo plate with chicken mole taco, adobada taco, and carnitas taco.  I also ordered a Mexican corn.  I asked if they'd hold off on bringing the corn until I could enjoy my tacos.  When I was done with the tacos, I was asked if I was ready for my corn and it was brought to me warm.  This was so much better than getting everything at once and having the corn cool off while eating the rest.  I also got a horchata.The tacos were good with the chicken mole being my favorite.  I thought the other two were OK. The rice was standard and the chips and refried beans were OK, too.  The corn would have been better if it had more chili powder but I'm sure they use what the average customer would like rather than what I prefer.Service was great and the friendliness of the staff was exceptional!If I were rating the place solely on atmosphere, it would be 5 stars all the way.  The interior design was well planned and it's a very inviting place.  I need to come back and try some other tacos and ask for more chili on my corn.  It's easy getting here from where I live.For those uncertain, exit the 215 at Russell Road and head west.  Halfway from the 215 to Fort Apache, there's a left turn into the Gramercy complex.  Drive a semi-circular path around the back of the building along Russell.  Just keep going past the coffee house.  Shortly after an open space, there's another building and Pinches is in the corner of that building.  You can see the 215 and the signs from the parking area.  On leaving keep going around the semi-circle and you'll be back to Russell very quickly.

Looking forward to trying it again in about a month. Hoping they can make some changes before I go back. When we got there (about 6:45pm) they had run out of bbq, except for chicken. So I had me some chicken. I give the chicken 5 stars; it was absolutely delicious, and priced fairly (1/2 lb for $8. So, they have at least one main dish right. The rest of my experience was lack-luster. Here's what went wrong: ISSUES:~ staff unorganized. This is not the fault of the staff; this is a management issue. Why open a place if it's not organized?~ they ran out of bbq! I know it's cheaper to run out than it is to make a little extra, but it isn't very nice for the customer to only have one option~ side dishes were good (green chili mac-n-cheese, and coleslaw), but severely overpriced. Those two sides cost us $6 and the portions were really small. Suggestion: if you are going to have small side dishes, just include it with the main course instead of jabbing everyone for every morsel on their plate.~the bar didn't have basic liquors; just knock off brands. Also, what's a bbq place without beer on tap?~ when we placed our order at the counter the process was not organized. ~ pet peeve: hate it when I stand in line to order and the receipt I am supposed to sign has a line for a tip. I like to have my food served before I issue a tip. Isn't the reward supposed to come after the service? I'm going to give this place another go in a month or so. If they can make a few corrections it could go from below average to great. In my opinion there's a-lot of work needed to achieve that goal. I want it to work. We need a great bbq place in these parts. Need a lesson on how? Go have a meal at Little Miss BBQ in South Phoenix. People stand in line there for the privilege of having great BBQ because it's that darned good.

Review Text :
I dont understand what the hype is all about. We waited an hour Saturday around 10:30am. It was packed. We sat outside (after waiting for an hour outside) in the sun. Its too hot to have tables outside in the sun with no misters. We were able to sit half way in the shade after a while, but still didnt help with the heat. Service was mediocre, ran out of water a few times and had to flag people down for re-fills, ordered the omelette..... nothing but grease. Hash browns had no taste to them at all....... just really not worth the hype or the wait. I think its just busy because its a newer place in old town Gilbert. Dont let it fool you, honestly if you are going to wait an hour, it should be worth it!I would like to preface with the fact that I have really never left a bad review as bad as the one I'm about to give. I worked in the food industry and I get the whole being short staffed super busy on a Sunday morning thing, I really truly do. However...Snooze is Over-hyped, understaffed, unappreciative of its customers. This "80's themed" breakfast joint seemed like a perfect hip place to have a family breakfast this morning, and especially so for my sister's last meal with us before she moved out of state. Boy, were we fooled! Upon our arrival I had my two year old son, my sister and her boyfriend, my parents, and my grandmother. We def anticipated a 45 minute wait so when we approached the hostess stand we were very content at being quoted 45 minutes. Not too bad for downtown Gilbert on Sunday morning. 65 MINUTES LATER I had to approach the hostess stand and ask how much longer of a wait we were going to have. "You have three more large groups ahead of you, so maybe 10-15 minutes." (70/75 minute wait total) This was after my whole family sat outside sweating our asses off. Here's a hint Snooze Owner, we live in Arizona, not sure if you've either A. EVER been here, or B. Lived through an Arizona summer, but it's pretty standard to have misters, fans, SOMETHING. It's great that you offer water and hot coffee but let's be real, ICED coffee would have been more satisfying to your customers, and COLD water, not pipe temperature luke warm water that really doesn't cool your internal temp down. Now, I do understand that there is availability to stand inside but it's so packed in the lobby area (which isn't a lobby) that you can't really stand comfortably, especially with a two year old and about 40 other hot, sweaty bodies. Finally the hostess is ready to seat us, oh and let me say that I had approached the stand about three times after our given wait time and the hostess taking names never remembered who I was. It's called "surprise and delight" to which this woman did not. Hire suggestion, find someone who's younger and mature enough to put a little pep into their voice. I mean really Snooze? You're a multi-location breakfast joint. Breakfast is the pivotal moment in everyone's morning and from the look and sound of almost all the customers around me you ruined that for a lot of people today.Upon being seated we sit at a table closer to the door so we have feel a breeze because we were seated outside where there were again NO fans or misters. After everyone sits down and begins to settle at the table some other, either hostess or kitchen staff member comes over to the table and tells us this table is for another party and we need to move over to the other table. It would have been one thing if she had asked us kindly, but she was pretty rude about it and didn't apologize. So, my family gets up and moves over to a table sitting in the sun. The waitress who ends up coming over to serve us is THE ONLY ONE who apologized, showed any enthusiasm, and was kind. She helped us move the table more into the shade and grabbed a high chair for us. If it wasn't for her I'd be giving a one star review. She was prompt about getting our order in and very understanding that we were starving and sweaty. It took her a bit of time to bring us ice water (she even brought a kids cup for my son) but she came to the table and explained she wanted to ensure a timely delivery of our food. May I also say that this waitress had been outside serving people all morning long who have also been cranky and irritated at their entire experience thus far and she truly upheld the moral part of running a restaurant. Serving good food to good people. For the price the food costs I expected better. The food was good no less, but it wasn't any better than the Good Egg down the street who has a shorter wait, happier staff, and indoor only seating during the summer. I ordered my son french toast which had good flavor and syrup, but the bread was a little dry and lacked a little in texture. The hashbrowns were great. They came very close to beating Beth's Cafe in Seattle WA, which has been a 5 year mission of mine. My dad ordered a simple eggs benedict sandwich which did not have a good portion of hollandaise sauce and fell short. Everyone else seemed fairly happy with their food and as was I. However, like I said it did not live up to the hype or my expectations (which were not set high at any point), not just because the service (minus our waitress) was the worst ever, but because Snooze has expanded too quick & too soon. The recipes should be revisited and refocused. The interiors were fun & simple, however like I've said; it's Arizona don't have outdoor seating during the summer, it's a different story when the high is 80 degrees. Overall, there is significant room for improvement. Owner of Gilbert Snooze, if you would like more feedback, I'm more than happy to give some so you can create a more positive experience for everyone.Zero stars.....We got there at 7:00AM to beat the rush. There was no wait time and we got seated instantly. That's where the good ends, we sat there for 10 minutes never got water or even a server to let us know they would be right with us. It wasn't busy and didn't seemed under staffed, the reason I say that is there were plenty of servers just huddled around talking and making eye contact with us. So five minutes later we just walked out. The couple right next to us were flustered too and were commenting on the bad service. I now know why there is always long lines at this place. I thought it might have been the food but I guess I'll never know.I enjoyed two cups of coffee and the front lobby ambience here this morning, for an hour, as I waited for my table and watched people who came in before me get seated...before me.  (We'd requested a table for two, at the first available spot: inside, outside, at the bar....didn't care.)We kept checking our text messages as we thought maybe we'd missed our text alert that our table was ready.  Nope, we hadn't missed anything.  Yet people were walking in and being taken right back because their party, by blind luck, happened to fit the correct size requirements for the table that was currently available.  I know I wasn't alone in my anger and confusion over why people who came in after me were being seated after me because I watched a steady stream of other waiting patrons walk up to check on what was going on with their table too.  This seating arrangement seems grossly unfair.Did I mention that I did this for an hour before I finally got mad and left?  And the kicker?  When we finally told them to cancel our table and that we were leaving BOOM a table for 2 was suddenly available!I was at the Snooze in downtown Denver two weeks ago where I enjoyed amazing food, stellar service and our party was seated in 15 minutes flat, with none of this seating stupidity. Get your shit together, Snooze-Gilbert.  Honestly...

Review Text :
I just landed a new job (thank you, thank you!) and the lady wanted to take me out for a nice celebratory dinner. I'll preface this review with a tl;dr at the beginning: It's gonna be hard for me to top this place as far as dining experiences go.You walk down the staircase, and suddenly, everything changes from sports bar to swanky '20s speakeasy, complete with bowtie'd hosts and hostesses, jazz noir music (provided by their very own pandora station), dim lights, and mason jar lined tables with dark tones. This is legit, man. The only thing that The Cellar shares in common with upstairs? The owner and the use of Ipads for drinks. Even the general manager is separate.The Drinks:The Cellar prides themselves on providing rare beers, and they sure do excel. In fact, I hadn't heard of a single one of them on their menu. They have a good variety of aged stouts, porters, belgians, farmhouse ales, even some wine type drinks. We didn't even delve into the cocktail menu. The staff is super knowledgeable about the beers as well, citing their flavor profiles and prominent flavors. FYI, since these are so rare, you're only gonna get 5 to 9 ounce pours on most. Sip and enjoy, this is NOT the place to be slamming nattys with the guys.The food:Food is served tapas style with dishes coming right to your table when they're done cooking. I could honestly write paragraphs describing the handcrafted details and complexity and deliciousness of this food, but I'll keep it short:3 Cheese/Meat Plate ($15) : We chose the Sopraseta, Aged Gouda, and a cheese I had never heard of called a Challerhocker (literally translates to 'sitting in the cellar'), all paired with different dips and preserves, as well as spent-grain bread from Birdsong. Amazing.Tuna Tartare ($12) : Beautifully prepared with crispy noodles, an awesome guac, and crispy wontons to eat it all up with. Incredibly well seasoned and tasty.Truffle Mac N Cheese ($12) : Both the Lady and I tasted it and said "...wut." It's not food, it's just bliss. Heavy on the truffle, but little bits of prosciutto add the needed saltiness throughout the dish. Perfectly cooked and fantastically flavored.Scallops ($19) : Jesus. How can they make food that good? Paired with a cauliflower puree and a salsa of roasted corn and currants for sweetness, this dish was out of this world! Service: Our server, Gabby, was absolutely delightful. She stayed with us to talk us through the intricacies of each dish, and was very attentive the entire night. Made us feel very welcome. Thanks, Gabby. The manager came up and introduced himself to make sure everything was going alright. At the end of the night, I spotted the actual beer bottle cellar and he took the Lady and I in and explained their long term plans, interesting things about the building (it very well may have been a real speakeasy!), and talked to us about the chef. He took about 15 minutes out of his time there to show us around, it was really cool!Overall, I can't recommend this place enough. Go and try it for yourself, I know we'll be back for the smores and cocktails which we were just too stuffed to fit in our stomachs!I had heard great things from friends but the wife and I needed to check it out for ourselves. So we headed down to the cellar. I will say that you really feel like you're in another world when you first enter the cellar through the sliding door. The wife even exclaimed "it's like we're not even in Charlotte anymore". Promptly we were seated and our server was quick to introduce himself and explain the menu and the concept. There was a lot of info to consider, and we perused the extensive beer (both draft and bottle), cocktails, wine and spirit lists. There were definitely some rare beers on draft, but the real rare ones are on the bottle list. Prices for the bottles are overall reasonable, while others are definitely wallet busters. The drafts that we chose were alright but not spectacular. My favorite beer of the night was a peach sour beer from Allagash. It was from a bottle and definitely pricey. The wife switched to a cocktail on the second round, and if her Vieux Carré is any indication of the quality of the cocktails at the cellar, we will become regulars here. I will say that the bar crew seemed to know what they were doing. On to the food, the smoked salmon flatbread was split between us and it was delicious. The flavors of the salmon were perfectly paired with the basil mascarpone spread and fried capers. The flatbread itself is very thin and crispy, not doughy like other flatbreads. The wife got the black grouper entree as her main and the burger sounded too good to pass up for me. First of all, the portion on both entrees and the flatbread were very generous, especially for the price point. My burger was cooked medium or maybe a little under which was perfect. The result was a juicy tasty burger that I will order again and again, along with recommending to others. The wife's grouper was cooked perfectly and the accompanying candied carrots, pesto rice and grilled artichokes complimented well the fish. No room really for a real dessert, but room for a liquid one in the form of a Greenman brewing chocolate stout to spilt between the 2 of us.The service was on point, friendly, informative and engaging in conversation with us about beer, food, etc. I will say that the only drawback was the wooden vintage like high top chairs which are a little clunky and definitely not comfortable for the majority of people. Maybe I felt it more sitting on that chair since others in the booth or the low top tables had really cushy leather chairs. The haves versus the have nots I guess? We shall return often, but may skip if only high tops tables with vintage chairs are available. I would be worth the wait for me to get a cushy leather chair on my next visit.

I noticed as I came into this plaza a few days ago that the name had been changed from its previous incarnation and I believe the menu is different also but it was so long since I was here that I don't remember.  I looked at the menu in the window and decided I'd give it a try sometime.I ordered online through the Eat24 ordering available through Yelp checking a pick up time of ASAP.  I ordered one order of vegetable egg rolls (comes four to an order), an order of Singapore vermicelli, and an order of combo chow fun with a note requesting no shrimp.The egg rolls were standard and OK.  The Singapore vermicelli had a pepper symbol next to it on the menu but there was little heat to it at all.  Since this was a take out order, I added crushed red pepper from a Thai restaurant I had leftover onto the vermicelli and I made it peppery on my own.  There was a fair amount of been, chicken , and good sized shrimp.  My wife's combo chow fun was good.  It had a nice tasting sauce and they did not add shrimp as requested because she won't eat shrimp.  The take out order was packed well.  I had a 5 minute wait as they had two orders in front of me and my drive is just about a mile.  I was offered water while I waited and the staff was present.I'll give the place another try.  I could see getting take out from the Chow Mein House from time to time.

Yup 5 big smackers for Hendertucky's new prized pig Tucky's. It was finger lickin delicious no doubt!First off if you are an uptight food snob and take yourself too seriously please don't come here. They are brand new so they are still working on the flow of things. Also if you've been to any popular BBQ place across the country you know you have to come and get it before it sells out. They are bbqing the brisket slow and low for 18 hours and it's so popular it does run out along with the ribs! Get there early! You have been warned son!They make the BBQ sauce in house and keep it in warmers. What a concept? It's sooooo good and soooo smooth. Original is sweet, yet balanced and Zesty has hints of pepper. My two friends and I devoured the 4x4 ($24.94) which is four meats and I think three sides. We all agreed the pulled pork was where the party was at as well as the spare ribs! We looked like the wild pigs from Hannibal getting down on this food. Yes, it was that good. Other highlights for me were the Mac n cheese and the sweet cornbread muffin. I asked about the cobbler and they said they haven't perfected the recipe yet so they are not serving it. I like that answer. Overall really good people serving really good food. I can't wait to go back fifty more times!For a brand new business, Tucky's BBQ is solid: The vibe is chill. The service is friendly. And the bbq is bomb. I'd love to give Tucky's more stars but they aren't there yet... My first visit was within a week or so of opening, and it was clear there were a lot of kinks to work out.. A month later, much better but  they still have some room to improve. Tucky's is not a spot to go if you are in a hurry. It is casual, order at the counter service. Each time I have been in there has been a line to do so and the person taking the orders has been friendly but lacked a little pep in their step.  Pricing for BBQ is right where I expect it to be, as compared to both national chains and other locally owned BBQ joints. Platters like the 4x4 or the Carload are a great deal if you have a group of 2-4.  On my first visit, quite a few items were sold out, this is understandable at a newer restaurant and especially at a BBQ spot.... On my more recent visit there was a noticeable improvement, the only item that was sold out was the spare ribs. I am not really a fan of the sides. The mac and cheese is decent enough I suppose, I prefer it to be a bit creamier than how Tucky's does it.  Cornbread is hit or miss, it was a bit stale on my most recent visit. But the meat...  Oh that smoky, sweet delicious meat. I am a rib girl, and Tucky's ribs are meaty and tender and so yummy. My husband enjoyed the brisket which is what he judges all BBQ spots on. The pulled pork is always on point. As others have pointed out, Tucky's epitomizes old Henderson, aka Hendertucky. It's not going to be a spot for everyone. This is not a hifalutin eatery, just some delish bbq served in a very laid back environment.

Review Text :
The menu here is not as extensive as in the more established places like Pho Thanh or Da Vang, but enough of the standard favorites are listed to make this a good destination for lovers of Vietnamese food. The food is tasty and very fresh with the requisite herbs and flavors. The restaurant itself is spacious and very clean and the staff members are very friendly and attentive. Note that the restaurant is in the inner corner of a small commercial square, so that it is not readily visible from the road.

This small taco shop, open less than a week as of this writing, oozes with potential. The good? Quality ingredients. Clean functional décor (Chipotle-like rather than Mexican taco shop). Friendly service. A simple menu with lots of variety. Indoor and outdoor seating. Breakfast available. Television. Great location on University just west of ASU.The not so good? The taco sauce, both green and red, lacked flavor. Definitely needs to be addressed with a reappraisal of these sauces or with more variety. A salsa bar would be ideal. This is Arizona and we are used to heat in our Mexican food. I loved what I ordered and look forward to exploring the rest of the menu, but the taco sauce...The specials seem to be the best values. The #1 (three tacos, rice, beans, tortilla and drink for ten bucks) is a much more substantial meal than ordering tacos ala carte. My taco was not nearly as generously filled as those in the photo posted on Yelp, an understandable consistency issue I suppose for a restaurant still in training and development mode. The tacos, however, are sized more like street tacos, so at $2.75 each it's important that they be generously filled if the nearby starving student population is going to be attracted.I'm giving Taco Shack the benefit of the doubt in the star rating because the restaurant is so new. Hopefully I'll be rewarded over time.

I really have to change the light on this spot.  In terms of vegas pricing, this spot is very affordable. Ramen puts you out about $8-$9, versus the $17 other nearby asian joints selling ramen!Please negate a previous reviewer commenting about the plastic cup. Any of these shops on the Grand Bazaar are going to be inclined towards a tourist, or someone else quickly passing through.  It makes no sense to serve ramen in a big ceramic bowl. Why use reusables, and bother with re-cleaning, when most people come in for a pit-stop and continue on? Silverware is more ideal if it offered full dinner service, and someone truly meant to sit and dine for an hour. I don't even think half the shops are connected to a water line, or have a sink.There IS an eating area, but offers very little seating (only well suited for 2's or 4). But come on. You wouldn't come here for dinner. Or with a group.  It's a healthier, Asian, on-the-go. But the food was pretty good! It's flavorful. It hit the spot. Well balanced. Noodles cooked well. The pork was cooked well. I also got seaweed salad, which was good, and a melon soda. Altogether my meal was about $18.Next time I'm in vegas, I'd definitely hit this place up again if I'm staying at Paris or Bally's. Ideal for lunch or a quick bite. The sushi looked pretty good, too. And that was priced about $6 a roll; also pretty reasonable.

My expectations for this place were a lot higher (from reading the reviews and looking at photos) before I drove up and saw a drive-thru lane. This place isn't on par with McDonalds or anything, but it's not about to replace a trip to Lolas either.The red hot chicken is labelled as their hottest dish, and it's an enjoyable buffalo-sauce based building heat that makes me think of wings without the mess. The crawfish etoufee, which I expected to be one of their stronger dishes, was pretty dismal, with minimal heat and a rather bland roux, and large finger-sized pieces of celery. Both dishes were large for the price (under $10/pp), and all dishes seem to be served over rice- a disproportionate amount of it.Service was okay- it's a walk-up style spot. Dining room is clean with Vegas and New Orleans-themed art on the walls. Tables have a variety of hot sauces available, along with a store-brand bottled version. For those outraged about the lack of dishes like alligator, crawfish, etc on the menu, their website offers an explanation that references their commitment to quality and inability to guarantee fresh-sourced specialty products. I'd rather they be straightforward about what they can execute well rather than have dishes they know won't be their best effort.We both ordered the bourbon chicken which was very tasty! The staff is very friendly and sweet. The only issue I have is their inconsistency. I know they are fairly new and still working out the kinks. The bread pudding I ordered this visit was completely different from what I had on my previous visit. It was not executed in the same way, if I order something I expect it to be the same as it was prior unless it is improved. Also the bread they include with your meal has no flavor and is very dry. They should revamp that as it could be so much better or just do away with it. I stand wrong with my love for the bourbon chicken and that won't change. I just hope that stays consistent.

Review Text :
Asian Comfort FoodGrowing up in East Central Wisconsin, I wasn't exposed to decent Asian food in the wayward days of my youth.  My memories of this cuisine sadly consist primarily of overcooked veggies in gloppy brown sauce.  As a result, I tended to shy away from Asian food in my college and young professional days.  However, after recently taking a job on Madison's south side, I've enjoyed a Renaissance of sorts as I've enjoyed the vibrant flavors of dishes from Ichiban, Orient House and recently SoHo Gourmet Cuisine during my lunchtime forays.  But I really didn't experience Asian comfort food until my recent visit to Mini Hot Pot.  Maybe it was the fact I came in soaked from a mid-November rain, maybe it was because I didn't eat much breakfast during my early morning meeting, but my Spicy Pork Bowl was as a soul soothing dish I've consumed in recent memory.Mini Hot Pot sits in an unpretentious Park Street strip mall next to the Copp's grocery store.  I was immediately greeted by the owner as I entered the restaurant and he expeditiously escorted me to an open table.  The interior of the restaurant (the former home of Mabuhay Philippine) has received a fresh coat of paint and new dark brown flooring.  The restaurant was absolutely spotless, from floor to ceiling.  While there is no booth seating, there are plenty of tables, with built-in heating elements and matching red and black chairs.  While the restaurant offers free wi-fi, I couldn't figure out the password the owner shared with me.My soft-spoken server appeared soon after I took my seat.  He diligently explained the different menu options, but there was a bit of a language barrier, so I didn't quite comprehend all of the information he was sharing.  I've been pigging out on pork lately, so I zeroed in on the prefabricated Spicy Pork Bowl ($7.95), ordered it spicy, and hoped for the best.About five minutes later, my server dropped off my order and I immediately fell completely and hopelessly in love.  The aroma from the garlic and ginger in the potent broth immediately snapped my senses to attention.  To the delight of my taste buds, my hot pot was brimming with thick, chewy noodles, thinly sliced pork, plump dumplings and lightly cooked broccoli. I thoroughly enjoyed the all the variety the flavor-packed dish provided.  The restaurant offers three spice level (mild, spicy hot and super spicy) and the medium level provided appreciated heat without blowing out my palette.   While I normally loath Wisconsin winters, these hot pots are going to help my kick Old Man Winter's ass until spring returns to the Badger state.Throughout the meal, both the owner and the server checked in so see how I liked the meal.  My grin of contentment surely tipped them off that all was well.  They will be seeing plenty of me in the coming months as I explore my way through their menu.  This is yet another fantastic addition to the Park Street dining scene (along with Noosh and El Rancho).  If you're in the area, I highly recommend you pay Mini Hot Pot a visit.

Review Text :
The gyro I had here is quite possibly the best I've had, ever- and I've had a lot of freaking gyros, trust. The meat is super-tender and flavorful, the pita is perfectly pillowy, and the tzatziki tastes great. They're not stingy about the sauce and feta, either! Efficiency needs a little work. Note that the shop has no seating, it's exclusively a grab-and-go counter. I spent 30+ minutes placing and waiting for an order. Two other customers present during my visit came in to pick up a call-ahead order and both still had to wait quite a bit. They've been open two months, so I would think this had been worked out a little better, but maybe they just haven't found their groove yet. Menu is limited, with a few sandwiches, a salad, and options for pastries. Quality is really decent and prices are very fair.NOTE: They're offering BOGO gyros for their grand opening, so hurry in to take advantage!Gyros are magical because they have the capability to mask the potency of onions. Even an onion hater like me can suddenly consume onions once they're inside a gyro. Unfortunately, the onions inside the gyros at The Little Greek were not the magical kind. They were regular diced onions that smacked me in the face with their spiciness and bitterness. My husband and I each ordered a gyro combo ($8.99), which comes with a gyro with the works, a bag of chips, and a pastry. I got my gyro sans meat, and told the employee to give me extra everything else. I've done this at other gyro places and have never really been disappointed. Here, the gyro was sparse and was about 80% lettuce. There were few tomatoes and I felt there was barely any tzatziki sauce or feta cheese. Even worse, once I took the first bite of my gyro the pita wrap completely crumbled. It's not everyday that I eat a gyro with a fork.  My husband said his meaty gyro was alright. I don't see us returning until a suitable vegetarian option is put on the menu (like falafel) or they at least get fries. If there is a next time, I'll remember to hold the onions.YELP 100 CHALLENGE 2015: #258

Review Text :
I don't understand where everyone else went, but my food didn't match the raving reviews.  Grabbed takeout at 11:30AM on a weekday, and the food was disappointing. Maybe we came on an off day, but it was hard to find anything to like, though we were unable to try the ribs, which sound like their best meat option.SERVICE:  An hour after opening, they were out of ribs. When my boyfriend  expressed surprise, she said "this happens every day." Uh, basic supply and demand would then suggest you make more. W e'd planned to split a three meat plate. Now, with only brisket and chicken left, we'd have to double up on one. To do so, we were charged an extra $7 for the double brisket. This is ridiculous, and we were put in the position to do so by the lack of other available meats. Takeout box was put  on the counter, had to get bags and utensils separately. If the majority of your orders are for takeout, perhaps someone should be bagging up orders appropriately.  Just a thought.THE FOODBRISKET: My initial thoughts were complimentary. But as we got away from the edges of the piece of meat and into the interior, the meat became dry and unappealing. The brisket was the best of what we tried, but we didn't finish it.CHICKEN: It was fall off the bone tender, but lacked flavor and was also on the dry side. This went unfinished as well.MAC AND CHEESE: I found it interesting, and kind of fun, that they used bowtie pasta for the mac. But it was falling apart and the only flavor seemed to be from the seasoing sprinkled on top. The first few bites were fine, but again, as we got more into the dish and the noodles broke into pieces and the seasoning was gone, flavor was very one note. I do like that they were nicely saucy (dry mac is the worst offense!), but this version was lacking.SAUCES: Okay, even average bbq can be made to shine with a good sauce. BF grabbed two different types for us to try and both were gross. One was sickeningly sweet with a chemical-like after taste we couldn't place, while the other (the Godfather?) was similarly sweet but with a punch of pepper. This wasn't balanced, it was just pepper. No bueno! I may be from Texas and used to great bbq, but after two years in Vegas, I've scaled back my expectations-- and even so, this spot didn't meet them.  Perhaps I'd feel differently if I tried the ribs everyone raves about, but I don't feel inclined to give them another try for a while.OK take a look at the pics, enough said. Fine I'll make it longer.Jessie Rae's BBQ is a small BBQ joint that you'll should try if you haven't already done so. Yea they're small 10 slim people could maybe fit inside. There were only 2 tables and a few stools on the inside and a few tables on the outside. They get busy during lunch and I've heard they do run out so come early. Got there at 11:30 am no one was there but a few minutes later it was packed.Obviously when it comes to BBQ everyone is gonna have their favorites mines ribs and brisket and of course that's what I went with. The ribs here were tasty. It had a nice bark, a good smoke ring, and was real tender. Mmm I'm craving these ribs right now. The brisket I got were served a little cold, not sure if that's how they usually do it but would've enjoyed them warm or hot at least. Will need to try again.If you like sauces on your BBQ they have three of them. The Pig Sweat which is their Carolina style vinegar sauce, the Fallen Angel which is their spicy sauce made from Carolina reaper peppers supposingly one of the spiciest peppers out there, and their God Sauce which I didn't get to try. Enjoyed the Fallen Angel and didn't care to much for the Pig Sweat.They also have these things where it starts with a pile of waffle fries, mash potatoes, or mac n cheese then top it with sauces, cheese, spices, and meat. Doesn't look like its good for you but I want one. I'm for sure going back.

Review Text :
OK Cheesecake Factory (CCF), I am waiting for you to finally come around and show me what you're really made of. After being told last Saturday that a party of 5 would have a 2 hour wait to get a table not including the 50 minutes it would take just to get a buzzer,(yes... 50 minutes just to get a buzzer) it is difficult for me to justify how the food is worth such a wait. I understand that the CCF is a hot commodity around Madison making its recent debut but there has to be a better system for seating people faster than some 3 hours! You'd thought Bobby Flay was the Head Chef with waiting time that long. I did dine at the CCF on its grand opening for dinner. Since it was only a party of 2 around dinner time, we were seated immediately. Drink was good I must say. Bartender did a great job hooking me up. Food however came out cold and way over spiced. My Cajun Paster had so much creold seasoning in it, my dish was black! Had heartburn the rest of the night. Understanding it was the CCF first day of operations, I was willing to give them a pass and return 3 weeks later to only be told it would be a 3 hour wait. No thanks!I prefer the CCF in Brookfield, WI. It seems to be a bigger restaurant and offers great natural light unlike the one at West Towne Mall. I may return one day not anytime soon.Like several reviewers here, I have been to Cheesecake Factory restaurants in other locations, enjoyed my various experiences, and was excited to see one land in Madtown. But...oh, boy...The place was hopping at noon on the Monday before Christmas--admittedly one of the busiest times we could have possibly chosen. Lucky for me, my party was already seated in the bar when I arrived. The decor seemed swanky and modestly cool, but the first thing that struck me as I sat down was that the bar tables are far too small for a party of four to comfortably sit and eat lunch (amazingly, though, no disasters with water glasses or plates happened during our meal). The noise level was really quite uncomfortable. My party had ordered nachos as an appetizer, which gave me some time to peruse the menu and order. Quite a bit more time, it turned out, than I needed. 35 minutes later, the nachos arrived, followed shortly after (5 minutes) by our entrees. Our waitress, to her credit, was clearly annoyed that the food had arrived as it did. Back to my order. It was foggy and miserable outside, so I was in the mood for comfort food. I am a sucker for Shepherd's Pie, which I ordered despite the misnomer: SHEPherds herd what? SHEEP. Like, uh, lamb. (C'mon man, ground beef makes it COTTAGE pie! But, whatever.) When the entree arrived, it looked fine, albeit with an entire parsley sprig plopped unceremoniously on top (I tore off some leaves and shredded them over the dish). But my first bite revealed the insidious truth: hiding out beneath the copious mashed potatoes and gravy was...not ground beef. Not in the traditional sense. You see, my dish appeared to be a subterfuge for hamburger patties that had not made the cut at the grill (it didn't take much for my imagination to slide to the slimy bottom of that slippery slope--GAAAACK!). Many of the huge chunks of torn-up patty were burnt on one side or both, and all of them were quite bland. (Which made me wonder about the quality of the hamburgers--but I'll leave that for some other hapless patron to review!) A few vegetables had been tossed in and the mix was slathered in gravy, then cleverly hidden under fluffy mounds of cheesy mashed potatoes. After a few bites of this vile concoction, I ate enough of the mashed potatoes to fill me up--as in, the part that was not in contact with the slop--and left the rest. There were no questions from the waitress when she took my almost entirely slop-filled plate. It didn't matter, because I would not have ordered anything else: I was too grossed out. The very idea of re-purposed food makes me gag.So...to recap. Long wait. Loud. Slow service. Expensive. Truly sub-par food. Sounds like a job for Kitchen Nightmares.Need I say that I won't be back?

Restaurant name  Portillo's Hot Dogs
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
One of the irritating inevitabilities about living in The Valley is eventually being unable to escape some douchebag who migrated here from ANY OTHER METROPOLITAN AREA, and drones on incessantly about how much better things are "BACK HOME."Chicagoans might very well be the worst.Enter Portillo's.Know somebody from Chicago? (Who doesn't? They're everywhere. Like cockroaches.) Ask them about Portillo's, and you'll never get them to shut up. "Dis is da gratess hot dug effer." "you kain't git hot dugs like dis in Feenix." "I'd keel yoo for a Portillo's"On and on.It's a hot dog guys, nothing more, nothing less. You'd do just as well from a CART GUY ON A DOWNTOWN STREET CORNER.We arrived at the new Tempe location and parking situation was a clusterf**k-zoo, which I can't see getting any better any time soon. Portillo's DID have staff poised in the lot to assist, but they seemed just as confused as most of the drivers.Inside? Holy Crap. Cavernous and full. Very busy, very loud and very colorful. Portillo's has a standard walk up counter for ordering, but today we were greeted by order takers who would then hand back our written orders to give to the people behind the counter. After paying, you are given a number and guided to the other end of the restaurant to wait at an "order up" counter. BTW, the lady working the mike and calling order numbers was extremely irritating, sounding like a carnival barker and, for some reason, feeling it was necessary to add a rhyming quip to every number called.I think this Portillo's was purposely over-staffed because it was grand-opening week, and they were still working out the kinks.ONE KINK IN SERIOUS NEED OF A WORK OUT was delivery and presentation. we ordered 2 JUMBO CHILI DOGS, 1 LARGE CHEESE FRY AND A LARGE ROOT BEER. We waited 20 minutes and what we got was a soggy lukewarm mess. We were confused as to why were asked "for here, or to go" when we ordered, as, even though we clearly stated we were dining in, we were handed a paper sack of food and a drink TO GO.Chili dogs don't wrap in paper very well. So what we unwrapped was a couple of smashed, room temperature messes with half the chili sticking to the paper wrapping. The dog was only ok, the chili generic, and they were a little too generous with the onions, but like I said before, "HEY IT'S JUST A HOT DOG." In this instance, a hot dog with absolutely nothing special going on. The cheese fries were hot and tasty with the cheese served on the side (again, in a to go cup). Not nearly enough cheese to satisfy the large order of spuds though, and I later noticed it was the same sized cup of cheese that came with the small order of fries too.I would discount this place as just another not worth it FRANCHISE OF THE "BACK-HOMERS," and the parking situation really does need a fix. But just as we were finishing up, I spied a rather frail elderly lady hoisting a ITALIAN BEEF, and man, did she look happy. Happy enough, in fact, to make me want to go back to Portillo's and give it another shot, this time with the ITALIAN BEEF.However, if you're just looking for a hot dog to throw down for lunch, see the guy on the street corner and avoid the Portillo's hassle.After all, IT'S JUST A HOT DOG.***********************************************************************UPDATE ALERT!!!***********************************************************************9/21/13Ok....went back and tried that Italian Beef I referred to earlier. Nope. Nothing special. Not bad, not great. There are a lot of "CHICAGO JOINTS" in The Valley. So far, none can hold a candle to LUKE'S Italian Beef.Just as many employees as the first time, but, even though Portillo's was much less crowded than the first time I went (is the luster really wearing off that fast?), the employees seemed even less organizedOnce again, our food took a little too long to come, and was, once again packed TO GO even though we specifically, ONCE AGAIN, said we were dining in.Overall, after 2 trips to Portillo's, nothing special or worth the crowd, wait time, or parking hassle.I HATE having to leave this review because the Portillos in Scottsdale blew me away when I first heard of this chain. My 1st visit to this Portillos in Tempe, was this past weekend. I was super excited for I was traveling from QC to Scottsdale and new this location had just opened and I had to pass it to get to my friends house! Why not try it out since the other location is out of the way and FAR from me! I was soooo super excited I think I may have exceeded the speed limit to get there! LOL! The drive through was pretty thorough and awesome when I arrived. You had very nice (but crazy people, because they are standing outside all day in this heat) taking your order. I ordered my norm, chili cheese hot dog and chili chesses fries. My ordered was confirmed by at least 3 different people walking down the drive through taking orders and by the person who collects payment; they were all very nice and quick. I pulled up to the last person who brought me my order (even repeated my exact order back to me), super happy my order came out before the 2 cars ahead of me (how nice and fast) left the drive through and rushed to my friends to devour my delicious food. When I got home and opened up my bad of deliciousness I was completely disappointed!!! Immediate sad face! I received the wrong order! You know the feeling you get when your parents tell you you're going to Disneyland and they end up taking you to the doctor instead? It felt like that, the build up of awesomeness, then the tremendous sadness in the end! I was so sad and frustrated, for you are looking forward in enjoying a delicious meal and you receive an order you don't even want. I received a regular hot dog with mustard.... it would have been fine and I wouldn't be upset if I liked mustard, if I liked mustard a tiny bit, but I completely cant stand the taste of mustard, I hate it. I tried scraping the mustard off the hot dog and throwing the bun away, but it still had its mustard taste, so I tossed it! My chili cheese fries ended up being normal fries, so I ate those and pouted! I know things happen in the drive through ever now and then, it was just frustrating for my order was repeated to me so many times, there was no way I felt I even needed to check it before I left the drive through. Then getting all the way home to eat it and it not being the right order is just frustrating. It's a waste of money and then a waste of gas to drive back to get my correct order. I will try to give Tempe another chance if I am in the area and checking my order every time will be a must now! You wont find me driving out of my way to try it again though :(As the Chicago area hot dog critic one thing I've noticed is that when traveling to other metropolitan areas hot dogs aren't nearly as popular other places as they are in Chicagoland. I did a search for hot dog stands near where I'm staying during my trip to the Phoenix Arizona area and found a place called "Ted's Hot Dogs" and the next closest place was immediately familiar. It was Portillo's, a very popular and abundant chain started in suburban Chicago that has apparently made its way to Arizona.I finally had a chance to stop by and the first thing that I noticed is that it's every bit as busy as the Chicagoland locations. The parking lot was completely packed and there was very little available seating inside. There were also tables outside, but people had birds coming up to their tables,sometimes managing to get away with a french fry before fluttering off.  Now, I've been to the Chicago area Portillo's many times and have reviewed a few locations. As a child I met Dick Portillo on a number of occasions and used to be a very big fan of Portillo's as a chain. Over the years, the quality control at Portillo's has diminished. The same quality ingredients are being used, but it seems like the training on how to properly assemble hot dogs, burgers, and everything else has suffered. Or management has simply stopped paying as vigorous attention to quality control. With a location over a thousand miles from Chicagoland I wondered if the menu would be different, if the way things were made would be different, and if being so far away the same degradation in food preparation that has infected the Chicagoland locations was present here.Upon walking in and looking around it sure looked and felt like a Portillo's. I didn't thoroughly inspect the menu as my order was taken while in line by a lady who wrote it down on the back of a bag, it appeared to be the same as the Chicago locations. I placed my order, and then got into the pick-up line to wait for my food. One trend I've noticed at the Chicago locations is repeated rhymes based on your order number. So they would call out things like "Number two, your order is due", "Number three come see me". I noticed with certain numbers they were doing the rhyming as well (this must be something they train on), but it wasn't the constant irritation of hearing it at the Chicagoland locatons to the point where you're trapped in a Dr. Seuss book.Finally my food was ready and I struggled to find an open seat without subjecting myself to eating outside where birds interrupting my meal was nearly a certainty. I finally sat down took my food out and snapped a picture. This was a regular Portillo's hot dog. The problem is we had the same inconsistent preparation we see at the Chicago area locations.For any of those reading this review that are unfamiliar with what a Chicago style hot dog should be, I'll go over the basics. A Chicago style hot dog has a few different variations. The version served by Portillo's is the most traditional style which is an all-beef natural casing sausage. The natural casing is skin that when properly heated will give the frankfurter a nice bit of resistance and a snap when you bite into it. The classic Chicago style hot dog comes on a poppy seed bun which has been steamed to become soft and easy to bite into. It has a pickle spear or slice, tomato slice, sport peppers, bright green relish mustard, onion and celery salt on it. Ketchup is considered to be the worst possible addition to a Chicago-style hot dog as the sweetness overpowers the flavor of the other ingredients.So how did the Portillo's of Tempe hot dog fare? The sausage itself was fine, but the relish application was a bit excessive. This added to the biggest problem,  the bun was steamed  too much along with being causing it to become a tad soggy. As a result the back half of the hot dog dissolved as I picked it up forcing me to struggle to finish the rest without getting my hands wet and sticky. The taste of the hot dog was roughly on par with other Portillo's, the big problem being a bit too thick of a pickle spear. I also got fries with cheese sauce. These fries were a litle over cooked, I'd say they were crispy but a few were so crisp there was no potato paste to be extracted from the inside. My overall impression is that this isn't any worse than the Chicago area Portillo's on any given day. But Portillo's food quality isn't what it used to be either. I did notice quite a few people at this Portillo's with Chicago themed shirts, Bears and Bulls jerseys. While I'm sure Chicago transplants and visitors only make up a small fraction of their clientele, it struck me as interesting. This is especially true since there doesn't seem to be a lot of other Chicago themed eateries around the area. Overall, I'm going to give my Portillo's experience here two stars. But for the Phoenix area readers your mileage may vary as its unique to the area.After all the hype about Portillo's coming to Tempe Marketplace and the photos friends had posted on Yelp, I was looking forward to trying this place. I've never been to Chicago, but I've had a delicious Chicago style hot dog before. I figured Portillo's had to serve up a hot dog better than the one I had from a food truck in Phoenix. Honestly, the one I tried tonight from Portillo's was not any better. On a positive note, the Beef Hot Dog "with everything" ($2.65) had good flavor with all the fixings: mustard, relish, freshly chopped onions, sliced red tomatoes, kosher pickle spear, and sport peppers. My primary complaint was that the "perfectly steamed" poppy seed bun was pretty soggy from all the fixings by the time I got home. It seems that the hot dog might best be enjoyed in the restaurant as the bun doesn't stand up very well - or maybe they should serve the fixings on the side for customers taking the hot dog to-go. The onion rings ($2.19) were pipping HOT and crispy, but lacked much in the way of flavor - definitely nothing noteworthy. The customer service was excellent! The drive though service seemed like a souped-up version of the In & Out experience: a person takes your order outside (instead of an intercom at the menu), another person confirms your order and collects your payment (also outside by walking up to your vehicle), finally a third person grabbed my order from the window and brought it to my car. This doesn't seem like the most efficient system (and unlikely sustainable during the summer months) but it's a nice attempt to make the experience more welcoming and customer-focused. Overall: good, not great experience tonight. I will return to try other offerings and re-evaluate. Thanks to a fellow Yelper (shout-out to Irina), I was surprised to learn that they actually have vegetarian and pescatarian sandwiches which have received positive reviews. Next time, maybe I'll have to try the Grilled Tuna Sandwich or the Halibut Sandwich!I don't get it. It's a lame hotdog in a soggy bun with annoying seeds. It also had neon green relish that had next to no flavor. I ate it because I was hungry and on the way to the bar. But otherwise I would never come back. We also ordered fries which look like the frozen Oreida kind you get in the super market and make at home. They even have the nerve to charge you for ranch dressing for the french fries! Nuts! Not returning.Lets start off with the cons of this placeCons: No combo mealsNo kid mealsIts literally right up the street from me (this is bad , very bad LOL )If you can get over that, then I guess you will be okI have been a few times now and I have to say they are slowing winning me over. The 1st time I went I swore I would never go back the 2nd time I went I thought damn this is a good hot dog the 3rd time I went I had to admit I am a fan.I love the Chicago style dog, I always order the Portillos all beef dog, it comes with mustard (big win for me since I'm not a fan of catsup) relish, freshly chopped onions, nice slices of tomato, a quartered dilled pickle and hot peppers all saflely bounded together by a perfectly steamed poppy seed bun and all this for just $2.65!! LOVE IT! When you check out there menu you will see they have a lot going on, from hot dogs, to sandwiches to burgers, to salads even soup & deserts and for you veggin love fools they even have a meatless menu too, so Im sure there is something for every picky eater out there.If you haven't given Portillos a try, I think you should, if they didn't win you over the 1st, like me, go back and try it again, believe me it wasn't love at 1st bite for me either but now I'm a fan!4.5 starsI have passed this Portillo's many times.  If I am headed down this way, it is usually down the street a few more miles to go to Ted's.  My intent was to get some dogs at Ted's again today but when I pulled off the 202 and McClintock, I had a strong craving for Portillo's cheese fries.  Something about that magical cup of hot, melted cheese sauce reeled me in.I finally figured out the perfect order at Portillo's.  2 Jumbo Dogs and a Large Cheese Fries.  This comes in at just under $10.00 and it is well worth it.  I have had other things at Portillo's (sausages, Italian beef, salads, etc) but nothing is as good as their Jumbo Hot Dogs.  I get mine topped with mustard, onion and that neon green relish.  They are a hefty sized dog with a little bit of a snap to them.  These dogs are laid in a nicely steamed poppy seed bun. They are flat out delicious and filling!  For their fries, they use a crinkle cut fry.  They aren't the best fries in the world but because of the crinkle cut design, they are the perfect fry to dip in that molten lava cheese sauce.  It coats all the nooks and crannies of the fry and makes it one hell of a dip!I'm sure I will be back soon enough!  Service was very attentive and friendly and this place is pretty easy to get to.  The parking lot is a little confusing if you aren't paying attention, but if you can navigate that and get inside the door, great hot dogs and cheese fries are waiting for you!"The noblest of all dogs is the hot-dog; it feeds the hand that bites it."  ― Lawrence J. PeteAlways a great place to grab a quick bite.  Located on the outer region of Tempe Marketplace, this place is great.  Lots of parking, ample seating, and fast!  Pay attention for your order number if you decide to grab a seat instead of waiting at the counter.I like grabbing a Portillo's all-beef hot dog.  What's not to love about a Chicago-style dog?  It's no Superdawg but it's a super dog!  Mustard, Play-Doh green sweet relish, freshly-chopped onions, two slices of tomatoes, a kosher pickle, and sport peppers nestle up against a hot dog in a steamed poppy seed bun.  Mmm!  Don't even touch this beast with ketchup or I'll throw my shoe at you.  For $2.85, I usually have to refrain myself from getting two.  It's cheap but I like to get other items besides hot dogs.  The Beef-n-cheddar croissant with both hot and sweet peppers... oh man.  Need I say more?  The Char-grilled Maxwell Street Style Polish is pretty darn great as well.  It's an explosion of grilled onions, mustard, and a meaty sausage [That's what she said].  All in all, it's a great place to grab a bite without breaking the wallet.  All that grease for such a low price.  ;)After reading Joyce W's review, I starved myself all day so I could relive her experience in person.  Upon walking in, I noticed the place was huge.  So many places to sit.  I liked the yesteryear vibe.  Thankfully, I followed a young couple in, as I had no idea what to do.  I found out, you need to walk to the back of the restaurant to place your order.As I waited for my order to come up, I enjoyed the young lady calling out the tickets as they came up.One-nine-zero, you're my hero.  One-nine-one, your order is done.  One-nine-two, we've got an order right here for you. One-nine-three, come see me. One-nine-four, wait no more.   One-nine-five, look alive.  One-nine-six, come get your Portillos fix.  One-nine-seven, (I didn't hang long enough to hear this rhyme).  One-nine-eight, no more wait.  One-nine-nine, it's your time to dine.  Two-oh-oh, you're good to go.When I sat down with my order, I bit into the signature hot dog, and it has a good snap.  However, my beef and cheddar croissant was so greasy it literally turned its paper wrapping translucent.  I texted Joyce a photo, and she remarked that they must hate me.  Yes, of course, it all made sense now.  The bread was too thick for me, and I tossed most of it.  The crinkle cut fries were okay.  I'll try the pasta, ribs or salad next time, with my dog.I'd never have imagined finding a Midwestern/Chicago staple so far away from the Midwest! This AZ location is set up exactly as the other ones I'd been to in the Chicagoland area - you can see everything done behind the counter, the lines and tables are the same, etc. Thankfully when I met up with one my friends here the lines were nonexistent and it wasn't terribly busy. First things first - gotta order a Cake Shake! She wasn't aware of their existence, so at my insistence she ordered one - hallelujah! I also got a plain hotdog with peppers to liven things up, and I knew a #CakeShake wouldn't hold me over until dinner. The employees were nice, the place was clean, all wonderful. Cannot wait to return for a more proper Chicago meal.I've heard a lot of really good things about this place but every time I come by, it's always too packed to try.  My co-worker and I noticed the drive-thru line only had 2 cars during lunch rush so we jumped at the chance to check it out.  To my amazement they had someone outside taking orders, at noon, in the hottest state in the country during the hottest month of the year with no shade.  After we turned the corner we saw a second person standing next to the menu and speaker box collecting money, again no shade or water in sight.  I was completely appalled by Portillo's inhumane treatment of their staff.  I wouldn't treat a dog like this and especially not an employee providing a service for me.  I understand that there are jobs which require individuals to work outside under the extreme conditions of an Arizona summer but the drive-thru line of a fast food restaurant isn't one of them.  So what if your customers have to sit and wait in their air conditioned car a few minutes longer for their fast food, it's no excuse to make two human beings stand outside in 110 degree heat when you have a functioning speaker box and two windows to pass money and food.As for the food, my co-worker enjoyed his dog but my burger was in styrofoam which is well known to trap moisture so my bun was soggy and my burger fell apart.

We stopped in here for a quick dinner tonight because it is the newest sushi place in the neighborhood and we've been meaning to try it! We were excited to find that we made it just in time for happy hour because it goes until 7 PM! The Sushi HH prices were good, although we did have a few problems with our order as they weren't made to match what the menu said. They also don't give itemized receipts and i'm pretty positive that our total was wrong! When we brought it to their attention, they weren't able to reverse the charges. Oh well, they ended up giving us a gift certificate to make up for the wrong total. I am giving them 3 stars because they are brand new {...they don't even have a liquor license yet!} and have to work the bugs out! We will give it another shot! :)

Doh Korean BBQ is a new Ayce Kbbq on the southwest/west side. They are part of the same restaurant group as Doh Sushi, Tofu Hut, and J Karaoke on Spring Mountain Rd. They are also located in the popular shopping complex that houses gelato shop Gelotology, coffee place Seranade, and the Rice n Noods. These guys are doing a solid job and it's a welcome addition to this neighborhood.They have a couple of different menus; lunch, dinner 1, and dinner 2. Lunch is available until 3pm, Dinner 1 includes everything for lunch plus short ribs, and Dinner 2 includes everything for Dinner 1 plus rib eye. I chose lunch this time, but I would like to come again to try the dinners.What I noticed first, Doh is using the more modern vents that more places are switching over to, a smaller fan that sucks up the smoke that is adjustable, rather than the old fashioned hoods that creates a lot of noise. After ordering, the food quickly started rolling out.The banchan was good, and their kimchi is very good, aged correctly. The steamed egg came out, and it was good as well, nice and fluffy, without being watery. My meats then started coming out. The brisket is excellent as well as their beef tongue. I thought their bulgogi is good, not at the Gen level, but good nonetheless.The service was excellent, with my server asking if I needed anything, and asking if everything is good, which it was.While Tofu Hut has been declining in service and food quality progressively through the years, I'm glad to report that Doh shows that a brand can reinvent themselves. Oh yea, one more thing...Ftr Ftr Ftr Ftr Ftr Ftr Ftr Ftr Ftr Ftr Ftr Ftr Ftr Ftr Ftr Ftr Ftr Ftr Ftr Ftr Ftr Ftr Ftr Ftr Doh!!!!

Uh-oh. I think Kinh Do and Dakao have some competition on their hands- the bahn mi here are cheap, huge, and tasty, with an incredible bread! The sandwiches are usually pretty low-priced but the version here is a "foot long" - literally two huge halves, double the portion that you get elsewhere, for only a buck or so more. My usual complaint about bahn mi is the lackluster bread- but here, it is fresh baked, fluffy, and beautiful. It almost reminds me of a challah bread. I'm definitely coming back here for more sandwiches, though the selection is a bit limited . Grab the dac biet!The namesake pho is also a good option- broth was lighter than is typical around town, and meat was an average portion but less fatty than cuts served at other shops. Large and small sizes are offered, typically under $10. Two of us split a large and didn't finish it. I was a bit surprised to see the pho included sliced white onions. Menu has some healthier-sounding options, including a chicken pho and a shrimp version.The spring rolls were the only item we were slightly less than blown away by- portion of two rolls came nicely plated and generously served with two cups of creamy peanut sauce. However, the filling seemed to be mostly shredded iceberg lettuce with the protein/noodles. Everything was fresh and priced appropriately though ($5).Service was attentive and friendly- much more so than I'm used to receiving at a Vietnamese place, to be honest. The massive order above was $22 for two before tip, and was enough food to leave an entire roll and half a sandwich for my lunch the following day. I'll be back!Still comparing vermicelli bowls in town, I found myself here. The glowing reviews made me do admit, I must admit.It's located in an old strip mall along Sahara Ave. The place was empty and the air smelled like old grease - the type that sticks to your hair and clothes, a pet peeve of mine.Should I get pho? Banh mi? Rice combo? Appetizers? Bun Thit Nuong Cha Gio:Huge portion. Lots of noodles, egg rolls and meat. However, I was not impressed by the taste of the egg rolls. I didn't like them at all and I just can't figure out what exactly I didn't like about it. Were they fishy and salty? Maybe. I haven't had this dish I did not finish so, this was a first. 2/5Com Dac Biet:Steamed rice with grilled pork, sausage, pork cake, and egg. Pork cake? Por que? It's not what you think it is. It's like meatloaf slices made of pork. 3/5Banh Mi Thit Nuong:A huge fat sandwich with grilled pork and veggies. Oh my goodness, this thing is thick and delicious. They bake the bread on premise so, when you get your sandwich it is so lovely and warm. You'll ask, "where have you been all my life?" Whatever bad things I said in the previous paragraphs, just disregard them. Their Banh mi more than made up for everything. Your first bite, the warm flakey crunchy bread...oh, my! And it's packing some good meat...lots of it. It's just perfection. It's about $6 and it can feed 2 people. Those places that sell sub  sandwiches has nothing on this. 5/5So, yes, come here for the Banh mi and take it to-go. Skip the egg rolls.

So I was invited by Jib W to come try this new Thai restaurant. It's only been open for three weeks and I love these family owned places. I was a little hesitant to come here cause my family really doesn't like spicy food and all these reviews are giving them five stars (no one gets all five stars). What the heck, just told my family we're going to this Thai restaurant tonight. Came here for a early Saturday dinner. Very interesting when you first walk in. Looks very clean, very new with a modern Asia flare. We were greeted when we walked in by the waiter. Smiling and thanking us for coming in. Very friendly. I started off with a Thai coffee and my wife had a Thai iced tea. Both were good but really sweet. Little bit too sweet to my taste but it was very good. We started off with two appetizers the Chicken Chon Thai rolls and the Sweet & Sour Wings. I was going to order the spring rolls but our waiter said the Chon rolls are special. Can't get this anywhere else. It came with three rolls sliced in half. So the rolls were ok. Couldn't tell what was in the rolls but putting the sauces on the rolls was good. Nice and crispy. The sweet & sour wings were a little spicy and good. Liked the sauce on the wings. Little sweet yet spicy. Really liked it. I had the Crispy Garlic Chicken with a side of sticky rice. Huge portion of chicken. Fried with this garlic sauce and asked for medium heat. It's was really good with dried basil leafs. Enjoyed it. Crispy but not dry inside. Moist. Really likes the sauce but couldn't really taste the heat. My daughter got her favorite Drunken Beef Noodles. I got a taste and it was really good. Loved the beef and the noodles. Unfortunately my daughter finished off her dish and she really liked it. My wife got the Chon Thai Seafood Special. It had shrimp, scallops, calamari and other stuff with no heat. Thought it was really good. It came with a side of rice too. Seafood was cooked really good with nice spices and really good portions. So for dessert, we got fried banana ice cream. It had a nice portions of fried bananas with ice cream in the middle with whip cream. Really good. The fried banana had a little taste of coconut. We could barely finish it but It was so good. So the service was outstanding. Our service was the tall Asian man who I found out is the cousin of the cooks. The cooks is a mom and pop show. So he was really good. Very thoughtful. Always thanking us. Filling out water glasses and pulling the dirty dishes. So we had a really good time tonight. Good Thai food, excellent service, and a nice friendly ambiance. What else could you ask for. Oh yea, prices were reasonable too. Enjoy. We sure did.When you eat food that's too hot and start breathing like Mu Shu the Dragon.I was invited by Jib W. to try out this new family-owned restaurant and everything went great!  They have only been opened just shy of a month and the place had a steady stream of customers throughout the night.  I was pretty excited by the time we were seated.  Since this is a family-owned restaurant, the service was excellent.  From the tall courteous waiter to the young sweet waitress, everyone here was super friendly.  After browsing the menu for a bit, we had decided to order a Tom Kha Chicken, Chicken Pumpkin Curry, Crispy Panang Chicken, and shared a Fried Banana with Ice Cream for dessert.  If you know me, you know I love me some Tom Kha and their Tom Kha is super fragrant.  It was delicious, had great citrus flavor, and super smooth.  I just love hot and sour coconut soup!  My only regret is not getting the large like I originally wanted.  The small is a good size but it was just too good to be shared. Now I'm normally a creature of habit and usually order massaman curry but the Chicken Pumpkin Curry piqued my interest --- so glad I ordered this.  I seriously couldn't stop eating.  I didn't miss the potatoes in a massaman curry at all because the pumpkin was AMAZING.  I loved the texture.  And at medium spice, it was absolutely perfect.  As for the Crispy Panag Chicken, it was delish.  I didn't put 2 and 2 together to realize we ordered two curry dishes on top of our coconut milk based soup so I was overwhelmed by coconut milk and that food coma afterwards hit hard [like a little baby who had too much milk lol].  And when we were stuffed to the brim and contemplating on going to EOS Fitness afterwards, we were offered dessert and just couldn't say no.  A beautiful dish of Fried Banana with a mountain of Ice Cream and whipped cream was placed in front of us.  We shared a look of, "What did we get ourselves in to?" before diving in.  I've been scarred in the past from soggy fried bananas in grossly thick tempura batter but this place does no such thing.  Had I been wearing a skirt, it would have flipped!  The ice cream had coconut and maybe some pineapple in it and it was good.  Like really really good.  The bananas stayed crisp and was perfect.  Although we were happily full, we managed to eat the whole thing.  No shame.All in all, it was a perfect dinner --- amazing service, a clean modern restaurant, some soft tunes in the background, and delicious food!  And with Chon Thai Food being two miles away from home, I will DEFINITELY be back!  Seriously, come stop by this great Thai eatery.  You won't be disappointed!What happens when really good food is topped by stellar service?  Five stars!I was invited out by "Aunt" Jib, to try out her family's new Thai restaurant.  After informing our waiter of this, and he lit up like a Christmas tree.  This guy was very happy... like a happy that's contagious...Looking at the apps, we decided on their Chon Thai Chicken rolls, which were fabulously crispy on the outside, and creamy on the inside, by what I can only assume to be potatoes???  It was served with a sweet spicy sauce and diced cucumbers and red onions, which gave it nice crunch and fresh flavor.The Chicken Tom Kha was delicious, with its coconut broth and bobbing mushrooms.My companion ordered the Drunken Beef Noodles and I went with the Panang Curry with Beef.  I adored both dishes, but was even more impressed when the waitress told me that I can call ahead, and place a special order for mussamun (pronounced "muss a mun", not "moose sa moon") curry, as its not on the menu.  For me?  You'd make a special dish just for me?  WHO DOES THAT?!?!Then, as if they hadnt been kind enough, our waiter asks us not to go anywhere because he has a surprise.  A surprise for me?  What could it be?  A sword?  Clown makeup?  Singing lessons?  Wonderful gift ideas raced through my mind, but none were as tasty as the mango and sticky rice dessert which was placed before us.On our way out, my companion mentioned to our waiter, how much we enjoyed his service, and he said that her words was the nicest thing that's happened all day.  My companion said he was the nicest thing that's happened all day.$5.99 lunch specials! With such a great deal and with numerous 5 star reviews, we knew we had to check this restaurant out for lunch. The interior is relaxing and elegant with a nicely laid out space.There are several lunch specials to choose from and they include a piece of crab rangoon and your choice of soup or salad. The soup for the day was a vegetable soup, which I chose with my red curry chicken, Thai hot. Preparing in advance for the spicy feast to come, I also ordered a Thai iced tea ($2).The Thai iced tea had a lovely ombre transition from creamy white to rich auburn. It was almost too pretty to mix up to even out the cream and tea (Almost). It was served in a tower-like tall glass. It was an excellent compliment to the bold, spicy flavor of the red curry, which had a hearty amount of meat and a variety of nicely cooked vegetables. As Thai hot, it was actually the penultimate level of spiciness, as the "super hot" was the one spicy level to rule them all. They definitely delivered on the spice end, and I thought the heat level was appropriate for Thai hot. As for the crab rangoon and the soup, they were pretty plain and served more as filler for the meal. Service was excellent and the young gentleman here especially did an admirable job making sure everyone was satisfied with their meals.So, exceptional service, great prices, and a lovely atmosphere. How can you go wrong? :)

Five stars because:1. DELICIOUS food2. Super reasonably priced3. The nicest staff1. My beef kebab roll was outstanding. The beef was perfectly juicy and flavorful. The lamb shawarma and fries also taste great.2. I don't know where else you can get a meal in Madison for 5.99. One of the best values in town.3. The friendly folks behind the counter are really why I am rooting for this spot. They were polite, smiled and were really helpful.It's not fast food, so don't go if you need to be in and out in 5 minutes (or call ahead). I really hope they start offering delivery and late night food!

Restaurant name  Burgatory

Review Text :
I was on the North Shore last night and was looking for dinner after going to the 21+ night at the Carnegie Science Center.  Given that I'd seen a few photos posted from this new Burgatory in the past couple of days, I knew it was finally open, so I decided to check it out.  Having been to the Waterworks and Waterfront branches, I knew what to expect, and fortunately, this Burgatory delivered.  My dining partner and I started by splitting a cookie monster shake.  It was delicious, with lots of cookie chunks, and provided just the right amount for both of us.  The kitchen also honored my request to go light on the whipped cream, an option I recommend if you don't like mounds of whipped cream on your shake.For our burgers, we both opted for custom burgers, since this is what Burgatory is known for.  I had the crab burger on a pretzel bun with the cajun rub, grilled pineapple, truffled shallot aioli, tomato, and arugula.  While the crab patty was decent in flavor, it was quite soft, making it a bit awkward to eat on a burger.  The flavor of the grilled pineapple complemented it nicely, though the juice made the crab patty a bit soggy after biting into it.  While it wasn't a bad burger, I prefer the chicken burger I had last time due to its firmness.  My dining partner had the fifty-fifty burger, which comes out looking pink despite being well-done.  Since he chose the options, I don't remember all of them, but I know he got it on herbed focaccia and with field greens, cucumber, and onions.  He enjoyed his burger very much.Surprisingly, we were able to get seated without any wait whatsoever--a rarity at Burgatory.  I'm guessing this is because people don't realize that this branch is open yet, so enjoy it while you can.  Our service was excellent, with our waitress stopping to check on us at several points in the meal, which was probably a result of it not being super-crowded.  Needless to say, this new branch of Burgatory beats many of the mediocre North Shore eateries, so if you're in the neighborhood and are hungry, check it out!"Vegan Tuesday" ...At Burgatory?! That's right, Yelpers! The famous burger and milkshake joint offered a spicy black bean burger & pineapple coconut shake this past Tuesday. I expect that they will switch up the vegan burger and shake option every week or month. Unfortunately, the black bean burger was not gluten free, womp womp...Just when I thought I was out of luck, the waitress brought me the gluten free menu. They had gluten free AND vegan options on this special menu! What a delight! I decided to get the naked (no bun...even though they DO offer gluten free buns!) portobello mushroom with an onion dust, tomato, onion, cucumber, avocado, and a Sriracha glaze. Instead of chips, I got the Quinoa salad. There wasn't a description of the Quinoa salad on the menu so I didn't realize it came with feta cheese on top. Not a huge deal, it was easy to take off. The Quinoa salad was quinoa, peppers, onion and spices tossed in a light vinaigrette. Tasty side dish & a plentiful portion size. My favorite part of the meal was by far the onion dust on the portobello mushroom! Slightly crunchy on the outside and the flavor seeped through into the warm, soft middle of the shroom. I will get a dust on my portobello burger every time I'm there! I would have liked a few more avocado slices (a few thin slivers is never enough) and a spicier Sriracha glaze would have given the burger the perfect punch. I understand making the glaze mild for those patrons who have a weak tolerance for spicy food. We didn't have any issues with our waitress. She was friendly, attentive and made great suggestions about the food. She was quite good at up-selling, I'll give her that! The layout of the restaurant is standard Burgatory and what you'd expect. Clean and spacious- no complaints from our group! We'll be back!

Restaurant name  Shawarma House
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
This area has been desperately in need of a good Mediterranean option, and Shawarma House fills the void- service is really friendly and genuine, menu has lots of options and great, low prices. Menu has several specials, like a whole rotisserie chicken meal with pita for under $9. The best option though, is their Sultani Plate, $20 and enough to share, with a little bit of everything on the menu. I'm pretty picky about shawarma, and the chicken version here was good but not great- what kicks it up a level is their garlic sauce. It seems to be sour-cream based which is a little unusual, but it packs plenty of garlic flavor! They also offer garlic fries as a side, though I have yet to try them. The kibbeh are solid, and so is the Armenian salad (do the +$2 to add feta).

Worst experience ever here. For a new place that just opened you would think they would've been more organized. When we pulled up to the drive thru I wasn't sure what I wanted so I told the guy to give us a minute. He then must've asked me five or six times what I wanted to order. Didn't I just say to give us a minute? So here is our exact order. 2 orders of the two piece dinner meal. One order with cole slaw and an extra side of Mac and cheese. Also wanted both of them to be legs. Both of them must be mild.  We pulled up to the window to pay and get our order. Didn't even get a thank you. When we got home the order was completely wrong. I didn't get two legs like I specified, they forgot my Mac and cheese, and our chicken was spicy. After 5-6 phone calls to the number that was on the receipt, and someone actually answering, they told us that they have new staff. They are only getting two stars from me because they would give us the same order for free. Note to staff, maybe you should check the order before actually giving it to your customer.

Review Text :
NEW OBSESSION ALERT! Braddah's Island Style blew me away! I had been reading the reviews of the other locations and Braddah's was definitely on my radar, but I never had a chance to make it in.I happened to be in the area and saw that a new location was opening somewhat near me and I felt like that lady in the annoying Mervyn's commercial back in the day... OPEN! OPEN! OPEN! So I kept checking back to see when it was going to open and low and behold, today I saw that it was and IT WAS ONNNNN!!!!!So I just tried their amazing food and I'm hooked! It was sooo good! It's fast casual style, a lot like Chipotle with the bowls, burritos, tacos or salads but with a way better vibe and food. The menu is a lot more creative with higher quality ingredients. Like seriously though. Soo OVER Chipotle. I had already been saying that anyway because their meat is so nasty. Tons of gristle. I'll never eat there again but thankfully I have an alternative. And a healthy alternative at that. So here's how it works:Step 1 - Choose One - Burrito, Bowl, Salad, Tacos or NachosStep 2 - Choose One - Huli Huli Chicken, Kalua Pig, Pulehu Steak, Grilled Fish, Grilled VeggiesStep 3 - Choose Any - Seaweed Rice or Brown Rice, Black Beans, Grilled Veggies ($1.25)Step 4 - Choose Any - Charred Pineapple Verde (Mild), Mango & Roasted Corn (Medium), Tomato with Grilled Maui Onions (Hot), Guacamole (Upcharge), Sour Cream, Cheese, Bean Sprouts, Lettuce, Purple Cabbage, Cilantro, Chopped Jalapeños or HabanerosThey also had some side sauces to choose from: Mango Habanero, Raspberry Jalapeño and Kiwi Jalapeño.I had the Steak Bowl (pictured) and in mine I got: Pulehu Steak, Seaweed Rice, Black Beans, Charred Pineapple Verde, Cheese, Jalapeños, Habanero, Cilantro, & Bean Sprouts with Mango Habanero sauce. Highly recommend. I ate every last grain of rice.They gave me a sample of their soon to be world famous Coconut Bark because I was a newb and WOW that stuff is fantastic! That salted caramel and chocolate with the coconut just melted in my mouth. It's won awards and I can see why.I am so happy! I'm going to be like their best regular now. I wish this place was closer to me though. That's the only thing that sucks. But it's close enough. I'm going to make the trek because it's worth it!Do yourself a favor and try the food here. It is soooooo friggin good, I can't even tell you.Shaka Braddah! See you guys tomorrow.First time visit disappointedBEWAREMy daughter ordered Huli HuliChicken tacos and found a BIG chicken bone in her food.Waited for other patrons to leave before I said anything.No sorry no concern no nothing!Luckily my daughter didn't choke on the 2" chicken bone.Asked who was responsible for cutting upChicken - they need to be more careful !All FIVE employees - said absolutely nothing.I'm taking my money elsewhere where they care.Well it's unfortunate that someone's safety and well being has to be taught to your "young leadership"! As well as their common sense and courtesy to at least acknowledge the issue; then show concern for your patron and at minimum an apology regarding the situation. NOT ONE of your staff whom varied in age offered an apology which leaves your patrons "the perception that there is no concern regardless of how long they have been in leadership".Obviously they learned from you as your lack of sincerity comes through your response.

I don't understand why this spot has a separate business listing: there is one counter inside of Jackie Bee Boba Tea. I guess the signage implies that the food and the tea are provided by separate businesses, but it's one space with one counter and staff provide service for both menus. Shrug.The location is across the street from a community college and next door to a computer gaming store, which helps to understand the target audience. I would compare the food quality to a step above a food court, with more variety than that description suggests. I've grabbed a few apps here and a $7 lunch combo before- it's Chinese/Thai fast food, with dishes like pad thai and orange chicken, and sides/apps like spam musubi, spring rolls, egg rolls, and of course, the boba.Service is quick and generally friendly. The shared dining area is clean with new furniture and games available. The parking lot is very small, so you may want to utilize the adjacent Dennys lot and walk over.

Restaurant name  Pomo Pizzeria Gilbert

Review Text :
POMO = Apple?! Yes! Super short story: Back in the days the tomato was introduced to the Italians from the New World and was then used throughout their cooking. And since tomatoes have seeds in it, it is considered a fruit. The tomato is a fruit variation of an apple, hence pomo!  Hopefully I have captured and given the word Pomo its origin. If not, you are more than welcome to correct the story! :)Anyway, the wait was 45 minutes. Started at the bar area to order some drinks. The Peach Bellini is a good sweet bubbly! Misters and the fan were on to help cool off in the summer heat. Within less than the suggested 45 minute wait we were seated to our table. All the pizza prices were roughly around $16 or so for thin crust pizzas cooked in a wood fire oven. We went for the calamari appetizer with a few surprises of fried shrimp, a couple lemon wedges to squirt some acidity over the breaded seafood. Pizzas:Pomo - Italian sausage, roasted red bell peppers, sautéed onions and mushrooms over the pomodoro sauce and cheese. The crust was a bit on the chewy dry side. $15.95Donna Rosa - (no tomato sauce pizza). Thin crust, with pesto sauce, cherry tomatoes and shrimp. A bit on the very salty side but overall was my favorite pizza. Pizza crust was more edible here. Calabessas - (I think that's what it was called). Thin crust as well, with tomato sauce, fried eggplant and shaved parmegiano cheese (which I loved). What I didn't like was the literal 4 teeny tiny pieces of eggplant about 0.34 cubic cm!!! What the heck happened here? A shortage of eggplant stock at the restaurant??? Not cool. Beverages: Pomo Lemon Drop - pomo juice (some pomegranate juice), vodka citrus, lemon juice. A bit strong and sour. $9Peach Bellini - peach juice and champagne $8 I would have to say that the intentions of the pizza menu was there but the ingredients were not.  With a little more care into the pizzas this place would be great. Good ambience.I looked down at my pizza and the heat fogged up my glasses like some sort of nerd who saw something sexy.Just kidding. I had my contacts in but I did see a sexy pizza in front of me!I love Pomo's and with one being so close to home in Downtown Gilbert, nestled nicely in the Heritage Marketplace, I'm over the moon! Great ambiance; beautifully golden tiled, wood-fire, pizza oven where delicious pies are cooked; and a friendly staff! EJ was our waiter this afternoon and he was super friendly, charismatic, and those dimples! Phew!  Since we strolled in shortly after 1:30PM, and after the lunch rush, there was absolutely no wait time.  It was nice and clean, the A/C kept us chilled, and EJ kept the waters full and the food coming!  Here's what we had:Bruschetta Classica:  Homemade Pugliese bread, roma tomatoes, garlic, fresh basil, and evoo.  I love me some bruschetta mainly because I'm a carb-whore and love bread!  The bread was toasted to perfect crunchy-on-the-outside-and-chewy-in-the-middle median and the fresh tomatoes were delicious.  Splash on some of their house evoo infused with crushed chili flakes and I'm in Heaven.  It was the perfect antipasti!The Napoli:  Described as, " Imported Fillets of Anchovies, Basil, Sicilian Oregano," I was immensely pleased with how delicious this came out.  The thin crust was on the chewier side which I wasn't anticipating since it was baked in a 900°F wood-fire oven and was pretty flimsy.  There was a good amount of cheese-drag whenever I bit into the mozzarella and the smoky salty anchovy was delicious.  It was a delicious combination that made my skirt flip.The Pomo:  "Italian Sausage, Roasted Red Bell Pepper, Sauteed Onions, Sauteed Mushrooms."  While I only had a single slice of this bad boy, I gotta admit, I wasn't too impressed.  The crust held up better with The Pomo than The Napoli but it was kind of vanilla.  Eating this pizza, the one that's suppose to be "the house" and special, was kind of bland.  It needed a kick from some crushed peppers.  Good sauce ratio on this thin crust pizza.Crème brûlée:  We wrapped up the meal with a classic crème brûlée.  We were actually torn between the brûlée and tiramisu but I was offered the dessert I wanted.  How could I say no?  Perfect caramel crust and a smooth creamy custard.  It was a bit strong on the vanilla but I loved it!  The strawberry shaped as a rose looked pretty but I wish they cut it into slices so I could eat it with my brûlée.  Also, I'm never one to turn down a little whipped cream with my berries.  Just saying.All in all, Pomo is a great place for a pie.  They're actually ranked in the Top 10 pizza places in town!  So give it a try!

Had the opportunity to try Corkbuzz during a friends and family event - what a fun experience!The decor and vibe inside is sophisticated, yet warm. Lots of seating options, including small tables and a private room. There is a 2000 bottle wine room that will look tremendous when fully stocked!Service was gracious and knowledgable - our service person made great food suggestions, the manager chatted with us about pairings and we even had a chance to speak with Laura, the owner! Everyone was attentive, even though it was busy.Food-wise, we had a couple of the starters - warm olives, and house made ricotta, along with the chicken-fried rabbit. All three were solid, but the ricotta is addictive! The chicken-fried rabbit was an unusual twist on a southern dish, and the warm gravy will be great when it's cooler outside!The wine selection looks tremendous and paired with the food and attentive service I suspect Corkbuzz will be a hotspot in South Charlotte!

I'm happy to say that there is new sushi bar in town which has a great all you can eat option. Luckily we were passing by on their first day of business so we decided to give it a try! I was originally just looking for some appetizers to snack on but the all you can eat dinner for 28.00 seemed pretty reasonable so I went with the all you can eat. I started with the Kobe beef sushi roll. It had Kobe beef, avocado and a sweet type of sauce drizzled on the top. It was delicious! The crispy buffalo shrimp was tangy . They were bite sized shrimp with buffalo flavoring. The 007 was like a California roll but with big pieces of shrimp and avocado draped over the rolls. I enjoyed these as well!Bacon and scallop skewers were mostly bacon with tiny pieces of scallops inside. They had different skewers available . I would like to try the bacon and mushroom skewers next time. Chicken Katsu wraps were good especially for people like my husband who don't eat sushi. He was happy with the wrap and his cucumber salad .We ended the meal with some honey toast. It reminded me of hawaiian rolls with ice cream and honey on the top. It  was my first time having this dessert be prepared for sweetness overload!I liked the variety on the menu and that there wasn't a lot that was left out of the all you can eat. Except for the sashimi but it was okay with me because I don't eat sashimi. I thought the picnic type of chairs were cute and comfortable. The service was on point and I can't wait to go back. My husband even found something he would like to try on our next visit!Let's be honest, everyone in this town is a sushi expert.There are just a couple of rules you are going to have to follow if you want to roll out a new AYCE sushi bar in Las Vegas:1 - Keep your prices competitive ($3+ more than everywhere else? Why?)2 - Keep your fish fresh (if you cant sell it before it starts to turn, don't try to pass it on to unsuspecting customers)3 - Don;t be cheap (buy sushi quality fish - believe me, we can tell the difference)3 - Offer what everyone else does (if you wont serve me sashimi with AYCE, why should I come here?)4 - Don't skimp on portions (look, stop being cheap, your fish is going rank, use it before it goes)I will say it not the worst place I have tried in Vegas, but if I am paying piece meal instead of going AYCE, I expect you not to give my tiny little sliver of fish.I'll be honest, the salmon tasted like crap. Sushi grade salmon doesn't taste like the cheap, color added, farmed raised crap you buy at Vons.We are all sushi experts in this town - if you want to succeed, respect that.Great AYCE deal! Fish is fresh, dishes are fun, service at the bar was attentive. As other reviews state, the AYCE dinner price is $28, which is slightly higher than the local average. However, quality here is among the best AYCE I've had and the majority of lower-priced businesses in town have significantly lower quality to match.APPETIZERS: This was our favorite section of the menu. The Jalapeno Popper dish that is commonly found around town was nicely presented here and actually had a good kick of spice for once! Salmon poke had a great spicy chili sauce, both were offset by the seaweed salad. We really enjoyed the grilled mackerel and the soft shell crab, but I did not care for the oysters. The real standout was the Rock N Roll appetizer, which is a riceless roll! NIGIRI: Nigiri selection was ample, and fish was typically pretty fresh. The super white tuna, scallop, golden eel, and squid were good options, but I felt the salmon and yellowtail weren't that great and lacked flavor. Rice was an average portion, fish was cut on the thin side.ROLLS: We tried the Twilight roll and the White Dragon roll, both had several sauces and fishes, both were tempura-shrimp based. I generally try to be more adventurous with my roll picks but by this point I was too full to care. Rolls were solid and they had a lot of new specialty options, but I wish they had more riceless options.The space was another sushi spot before Hanabi took over, but the modern, clean décor and chalkboard specials menu are a bit different. Service at the bar was attentive and we were frequently checked on by both chefs and management, though our empty dishes stacked up- this didn't really bother me, as they were pretty busy.For those who are outraged by the higher AYCE price here- if $3 is really a deal breaker for you to drop your rating over, you have no business coming here. Stick to the Dollar Menu. The quality of dishes, freshness of fishes, and variety on the menu are more than enough to warrant the difference in cost.TIP: Follow them on social media for a 50% off coupon for November & December for a la carte orders (good lunch option).Another decent AYCE spot. This one takes over the space formerly occupied by 808 Tapas. Hanabi has a fairly large menu with some items only available a la carte. Nigiri is the way to go here. The quality is pretty good for an AYCE place. Rolls on the other hand weren't my favorite. Some, like the yellowtail special with cooked shrimp, jalapeño, cilantro, cucumber topped with yellowtail, ponzu, habanero, were too hot for my tastes. The Tiger roll (shrimp tempura, crab topped with spicy tuna with eel sauce) was the best of the bunch, the Mad Caterpillar (fresh water eel and cucumber topped with spicy tuna, spicy eel sauce) was decent, and the Crispy tuna scallion was not good with tuna that looked and tasted liked canned tuna. As a whole, the rolls seemed hastily crafted and lacked the precision of superior rolls found elsewhere.2.5 Stars

Before my favorite churrascaria opened, I used to go here. Although it's cheaper here and they're open for lunch everyday and they have goat cheese at the salad bar, the service and food quality is marginal. They have the usual Brazilian BBQ salad bar items such as smoked salmon, lettuce, tomatoes, mushrooms, asparagus, cheeses, olives, salami, beans and rice etc. They give you pao de queijo, fried bananas and mashed potatoes. The meats include chicken, beef, pork, sausage and lamb. I've tried their Key Lime pie, cheesecake, flan and chocolate mousse all of which were just ok.The gaucho guys seem to take longer going around and when I come to a churrascaria, I come famished...waiting cannot happen. They seem careless too. I'd have blood/ oil/ meat juice drip next to my plate or my arm! Obrigadinha!Out of the churrascaria's in Vegas. FdC on Flamingo is #1 on my list, TdB is #2, VB in Summerlin is #3...and that P place in Planet Hollywood? Forget it!Took my dad for his birthday here since he's never been and since he's a major carnivore; definitely had to put my vegetarian on the side today for my dad lol. Located in the Town Square shopping center and across from Look Style Society, very easy to get to and has it's own parking spot.There was a bit of a wait, not too long, about 20 minutes on Friday, Labor Day Weekend so that's pretty good. But I made reservations earlier for 8pm, which I think is the best way to go.Came here for Dinner at $49.99/person which included unlimited salad bar and unlimited meats! The salad bar had tons of options! My favorites were the Lobster Bisque of course, and the Potatoes Gratin. I also saw a variety of cheeses, deli meats, curried cauliflower, all types of salads with quinoa, beans, and your typical toppings with romaine lettuce, grilled veggies, mushrooms, smoked salmon, shrimp, breads, etc. Pretty amazing but don't get too filled up on all of that since at your table you get unlimited meats coming around!If you've never been here, they have little coasters on the table, one per person, with one side green and one side red. If you want meat, you flip it to the green side, and if you need a little break or if you've decided to throw in the towel, you flip it to the red side! When it's green, they have servers that walk by your table, each with a large skewers of a different style of meat and you tell them how many pieces your want! The options from what I can remember were Filet Mignon, Top Sirloin (The infamous Picanha- the FAVE at our table), Lambs Chop, Parmesan Pork/Chicken, Bacon wrapped Filet, Pork Ribs, Flank Steak, and Brazilian Sausage! Phew! Tons of meat options!Then if you're still not full, or if you suddenly get a second stomach like me right when dessert comes, they have a lot of great options as well! Brazilian Cheesecake, Crème Brûlée, Brazilian Flan, Chocolate Mousse Cake, Bananas Foster Pie, Key Lime Pie, Carrot Cake, Pecan Pie, Brazilian Papaya Cream, and Coconut Pie. They brought the dessert tray out and I wanted to try basically everything especially the Crème Brûlée, Flan, and Papaya Cream but decided to go with the Carrot since it's my dad's favorite. So this carrot cake is pretty amazing. It doesn't have raisins in it and it has a coconut element to it so just that makes it an A in my book but on top of that it was super fluffy and moist and wasn't too sweet. I mean it was sweet definitely but it wasn't that artificial, loaded with powdered sugar type of sweetness. Perfect way to end the meal! Even though I don't eat meat often nowadays, on meat days, this is a definite contender especially if it's a special occasion. Yum! I'll be back! (In Arnold voice lmao) :)Went to Texas de Brazil for dinner this past Saturday night 10/10th @ 9:30pm for a fantastic 2 hour dinner. Really late to be feasting as a carnivore so late at night, but the only other available reservation time was at 7pm. Given the fact I made the phone call at 6:56pm, those 4 minutes was kinda untimely; so we ate late into the night.This Brazilian steakhouse was half filled with patrons when we arrived. Immediately greeted by a very friendly hostess, who sat us at a nice table for 2, staged among a classy and romantic ambiance; close to the salad bar.The lobster bisque was outstanding! Plenty of gourmet cold and hot salad bar food selections to savor.Our server Hanna, from Rio, was excellent! She coordinated with a few other servers offering us plenty of mouth watering tasty Brazilian meat selections, all hand carved tableside, with impeccable service. Our bottle of fine red wine was delicious & intoxicating, yet overpriced; but what fine dining restaurant doesn't mark it up 300%?! Surprised we were offered desserts considering we were the last couple in the restaurant and everybody probably wanted to go home. But we agreed we were stuffed with no room for dessert! However, the dessert selection our server Hanna presented to us at our table looked absolutely amazing.Overall, Texas de Brazil was an outstanding fine dining experience that I would gladly return to; at an earlier dinner hour. Reservations recommended in advance. No pictures taken. Go see for yourself :-)YELP 250 CHALLENGE 2015: #232

Review Text :
My coworkers were talking about crepes, places to get crepes, and about a really popular crepe place that sold their crepes from their house and advertise through the Mexican "Craigslist" got popular and opened up a real brick & mortar store. Typical water cooler chitchat with our delivery truck driver when he stops in for order pick up.That got me interested. At first they told me it was on E. Charleston. But I later found out after another coworker said it was closer to W. Charleston and Decatur. I was thinking how come I never heard about this place, I used to only lived a few streets away.So after a mandated doctor's office visit about a mile or two away, I decided to give Crêpe Station a try. I nearly missed the small strip mall it was located on due to alerts that popped up on my phone, plus a lane was closed on Charleston due to who knows what. But with the slow moving traffic, I was able to turn into the plaza it was located in.The place it turns out has only been opened about 2 weeks. But the owners did have several months to perfect their recipes & techniques while operating out of their underground home operation. Hundreds, if not thousands, of satisfied Mexicans can't be wrong :) And I am really glad to learn about this place through words of mouth networking.Their menu is simple and organized logically. You have your sweet crêpes, your savory crêpes, paninis, beverages (coffees, smoothies). For first timers, ordering is not as stressful as trying to narrow down your option to just one from a 400+ items Chinese takeout menu.I wanted to try their Red Velvet dessert crêpe, but ultimately picked the Chicken Pesto Crêpe (it was around noon and I have not have had lunch yet). The young kids behind the counter were nice and took the order and had it prepared and delivered it to my table after a nominal wait.The included side salad looks better than most side salads you get at 95% of the restaurants out there. It has some sliced strawberries and mangos on top of mixed mesclun greens, with a light balsamic dressing. The Chicken Pesto Crêpe looks good, the presentation is nicely conceptualized & executed, the crepe was cooked just perfectly. I was happy with my selection and the price tag. Service was pleasant and efficient too.Would I go back and try some more of their items from their simple menu?  Yes, of course. I'll be back. Probably next Thursday after another scheduled visit back to the medical specialist.  No, it's not a tomb-er!  (I hope you sound like Arnold Schwarzenegger in your head as you read that).Both Yelp and the door say they open at 9am.  The girl opening up today did not arrive until 9:05 to open the door and then spent 10 minutes setting everything up before even acknowledging me in the store.  One customer left because she was not ready to start business for the day.When she was finally ready she was very short and rude acting like I was bothering here.  Another worker showed up around 9:10, never said a word just started helping her open.If you want repeat customers, employees should be ready and be a little more polite to customers.As for the food, the coffee was good. A Carmel Macchiato.  I also ordered a veggie crepe which is just tomatoes, pesto, mozzarella and basil.The crepe itself had no taste, if not for the inside it would have been bland.  I would rate the food 3 stars, and maybe even given an overall 4 stars if not for the lack of customer service and customer interaction.Teaching moment:  things happen, if you are running behind, still greet the customer with a smile, have some fun with the fact you are running late and let the customer know it will be a minute.  That goes a long way versus acting like we are bothering you.

Review Text :
Wow, there's a new kid on the block, but not all that is new means good, I almost am in shock at my experience when compared to other reviews and opinions I've read so far.Maybe it's just Sunday's. The Sunday morning service was laughable at best, laugh because I didn't want to cry. I wasn't certain how they handle call aheads, or reservations, it was also a weekend brunch, so I attempted to call ahead to at least ask what the wait looked like. Two calls later and no answer, we were already there and parking, but upon entering the compound that is Ocotillo, I found the lady at the maitre d stand, with a phone just below her left elbow. (Seriously?)I inquired as to the wait as I put the name in with her and was told just a few minutes, tables were being cleaned now. I guess "being cleaned" meant 30 minutes, I must have forgotten my English to English translator, silly me. I was unpleasantly surprised to find 6 or 7 open tables as I was getting seated, and the wait had stacked what appeared to be 4 more parties behind me. At this point my best guess was that there weren't enough staff for a weekend morning to handle guests demands. I ordered the roast beef and potatoes hash, which came with a sunnyside egg, and after requesting the egg medium, the egg was way undercooked; about 3 minutes under. I tried the roast beef, which was chunks of tough beef, overly chewy and super fatty and the potatoes were large cubes about 1.5inch by 1.5inch, this was not a hash. I had about two bites before deciding to give it back to the server. As I returned the hash, the server replied with a friendly, can I get you something else in stead, which was kind of her, trying to appease my dislike with a different dish, was helpful on her part but I was short on time and wasn't interested in something else at that point.The rest of my party all independently came to the conclusion that their meals weren't so amazing as to spend the $$ they're charging here, and the wait was over the top. One of the people in the party tried to order the breakfast chimichanga, which they were out of. Their second choice; scrambled farm eggs, was quite underwhelming. Our party also ordered the bread pudding bowl, which was neither bread pudding, nor was it in a bowl. It was tasty though, and had they called it loaf of gooey cinnamon bread on top of roasted apples with cream, it would have been spot on.Being as objective as possible after such a poor experience, the server was friendly and tried to resolve my complaint by allowing me to order a different meal and the bread pudding bowl tasted good, but caveat emptor to the person who orders it expecting bread pudding.I can't say that I'll be back soon, but they do have a to go coffee bar, so if you drink coffee maybe you can grab and go from there on your way to work.Happy yelping!Fab "new" spot located in Central Phoenix. It does a great job of delivering delicious New American food and providing an open and industrial/modern space. The spot contains a restaurant, cafe and tons of open space like a beer garden, bar and patio.For the restaurant (menu wise), they serve lunch and dinner. However, they only serve brunch on the weekends. I came here for lunch with Stacy M to get a little taste of what Ocotillo had to offer and was pleasantly surprised. We ordered their Iced Coffee Boba, filled Dates, Cabbage Salad and a Egg White Breakfast Burrito to share and it was more than enough.Iced Coffee Boba: I would pass on this as the coffee tastes like any typical iced coffee you can get, however the boba was overly done and mushy instead of having the chewy, bouncy texture it should have.Dates: dates filled with ricotta and topped with almonds and blackberries, this appetizer is deliciously simple and perfect for sharing. No judgement if you don't want to, it's perfectly acceptable because they are that good!Cabbage Salad: this salad is fresh, light and comes is a more than generous portion. It has shaved cabbage, carrot and comes with a lovely tea dressing that adds a tart and fragrant flavor to the salad.The Egg white burrito: was probably the best egg white anything I've ever had, it was so flavorful and clean. This entree surprised me the most. Filling, clean tasting but nothing short of flavorful from the ingredients and house salsa that's served with it.The cafe is the only cafe in Phoenix that serves Sightglass coffee and has a good arrangement of drinks, snacks and pastries. Although separate from the rest of the restaurant, this area is quiet and perfect for solo coffee/tea drinkers. I've had their Autumn Latte, breakfast burrito (egg and bacon) as well as their Nutella Croissant and it was all so delicious. They definitely take typically made items and add their own twist which is truly refreshing. The price is also a lot cheaper than most other cafes I frequent, which is a definite plus!The staff here can be a bit slow, but they are all so friendly and easy to talk to. They truly make you feel welcomed and show their appreciation. They are also really receptive to any questions or concerns you may have. Definitely a place to check out!

Review Text :
Crack fries: aptly named. Beer selection: ridiculous. Burgers: gigantic and tasty. Staff: exceptionally attentive (especially since it was the first day). To be honest I went in expecting to be let down because it seems like the kind of thing I would hate, but they seem to have figured out a really solid recipe for making this behemoth establishment something interesting and worthy of return visits. I was especially impressed with the service as our waiter was super friendly, knowledgable, and on top of everything. I'm also excited for their killer happy hour specials (half off burgers and $3 taps!) and their giant Bloody Mary bar on Sundays. The real test will be seeing what the atmosphere is like when the students return as that will really make or break a place like this for me and my friends.Okay, HopCat, color me impressed. HopCat you can be my best Madison beer friend with extra benefits. You promised so much, and I was left skeptical. Your offerings were written like a profile on eHarmony. Everyone lies on those a little bit so I assumed not everything you said could be true! HopCat lives up to the hype that has been blasting throughout Madison social media. If you love beer, this bar is THE place in Madison for you to check out.I didn't even on plan on stepping in on your grand opening, but it just happened to work out. I had a friend from out of town visiting, and we were hanging out at the Capitol. We decided 3:00 would be a good time for a brew so we stopped by HopCat to give the new place a shot.When we walked it, it was completely packed. I was quite interested in trying out the new beer house in town so I was willing to wait the 30 minutes that was apparently needed for a table because they were so slammed. Well, the table only took about 5 minutes so I'm not going to complain there!When you first walk in, you are going to notice the massive floor plan and giant bar on the ground floor, as well as, the giant staircase that leads up to more of this giant beer house. The second floor is about half the size of the first, maybe a little smaller. The bar is significantly smaller than the one downstairs. The main bar has 130 beers on tap from around the country and many more in bottles from around the world. The upstairs bar has 30 local beers on tap. My tip, if you're impatient is to order local beers if you're seated upstairs. If you like trying new things like me, you won't mind the slightly longer wait for a beer to be transported from downstairs.Did I mention that there are 130 beers on tap? Well, there are, and I am truly impressed by the diverse, well organized beer list that has been assembled. The list even includes a key that educates the customer about glass type and size. I truly did not feel overwhelmed, despite the number of beers, because the list was well curated. MEGA props for pulling this off. I have felt overwhelmed with much smaller lists. The tap list was also dated so it appears that the list will be rotating frequently. I am happy to see this, although I doubt I will wear the current list out any time soon.We were served two orders of "crack" fries with our beers. They were both free for the grand opening, but I'm glad that we got to try them because I'm not sure if I would have randomly ordered these. They were very good WITH the cheese sauce that the fries came with. The fries alone were slightly overpowering on the seasoning. There was A LOT of pepper and salt on them, but the cheese balanced out the seasoning. I would have liked to see a little more garlic and less pepper/salt to mellow the spices out a tad.Our server was quite attentive. I jumped the gun a little bit by asking another server for waters because we hadn't received any. Our server came back with a 2nd set of waters as soon as he returned (oops). I am just assuming that they were so slammed this afternoon that he had a lot to juggle.The atmosphere feels very trendy, and I appreciate the classic rock images plastered all over the walls. It's a little loud but not unbearably so for this type of establishment. I could still hear my friend at the table. The awesome classic rock mix playing over the sound system was greatly appreciated.The management encourage that you carve into the table with whatever knife or other sharp object you brought with you. Do not assume the people before you are rude. Table carving is HopCat's trendy thing. Add a note!HopCat, you're a CoolCat, and I would like to bring more of my friends over to try out what you're offering. I can see myself staking out a table for many hours to poke around your beer list some more. As a beer & wine drinker, I truly appreciate what the well curated list that you are offering this community. There is beer and mediocre tap selections everywhere in Madison, but I think I finally found a place that the proud beer lovers of Madison can call their home.Keep up the good work. I'm honestly unsure how you made such a beer behemoth run smoothly. You are the Mussolini of beer (he made the trains run on time). Let's hang out again sometime soon!The newest hottest joint in Madison. It is where all the cool kids are going. A few things to remember before you step into the vortex of beer and crack fries. * No one under 21 unless accompanied by a guardian.* No one under 21 after 10:00 PM. * Come hungry and thirsty. Now lets get rolling. You walk through the door to be greeted by an array of friendly staff, have your I.D. ready. Once you get your table prepare to read. The beer list is extensive.* 30 beers on tap from Wisconsin that don't change* 100 rotating beers on tapThe food. I just cant get past the crack fries.~ Vladimir Poutine: Crack fries with potato and cheese pierogi, cheese curds, stout caramelized onions and cherry smoked bacon smothered in sour creme gravy.~ Buffalo Rolls: Simple and delicious. Tender chicken coated in house made buffalo sauce wrapped in wantons. It was crunchy on the outside yet the inside layer of the wanton had a nice chewy texture to it ~ Wings: I am an avid supporter of wings. I just feel like it is one appetizer that does not get enough credit. These wings were tossed with an apple BBQ sauce. Not a lot of spice but some darn good flavor. The meat lulled right off the bone with little resistance. Definitely a must try app.  The rest of the food looks amazing so I guess more trips and more pictures are in order. The atmosphere is laid back and fun. Get to know your server and you will have a great time. Too many times a place opens and they have to weed out the bad staff. This establishment seems to have done that before opening their doors as I received a smile and hello from every employee that walked by.  One last note.  Ask for Allen as your server. He's one of the great ones.I have this thing about overhyped places...I lose interest. So even though I initially was looking forward to HopCat...HypeCat... opening, I decided to wait until the masses were on to the next new thing. When I found myself downtown today, I popped in to check it out. What the heck...? Ok. So this place does everything right. Ambiance? Clean, well decorated and the perfect lighting and music levels (and every single song played was a favorite, during my entire visit). A singing waiter, who sang the whole time I was there (and thankfully in a good voice) is a clue that the staff enjoys being there. That sounds like it could be annoying, but it really wasn't. The downstairs bar is a huge U-shaped affair, and there was only one bartender working when I stopped in, but he handled everything well on his own. Calm, friendly, knowledgeable, and just attentive enough. Adam is a pro. I inquired about half pours of beers, and that indeed was an option. I tried two beers that were new to me, one of which Adam recommended, and it was much better than the one I picked on my own. Both were very good, though.I had intended to only grab an order of the much-lauded crack fries for lunch, but then Adam informed me that all the tempting-sounding burgers were half price. I'm not sure what the hours or days of that special are, but I was there around 3:30 pm on a Thursday. I rarely ever order burgers, but I'd been in the mood for an old favorite, a blue cheese and mushroom burger. When I saw that was one of their special burgers, I couldn't resist. I'm gonna tell you guys, it was fantastic. It came with lettuce, tomato, swiss, and shoestring fried onions in addition to the mushrooms and blue cheese mayo. It was cooked exactly medium, just as ordered. It was a bit of a mess to eat, but they bring you plenty of napkins when it's delivered to your table. Or the bar, as it were. As I were...sitting at the bar. Crack fries are all they are hyped to be. Addictive. Everything was all I could want it to be. Corporate entity, yes, but you kind of forget all that once you fall under their spell of perfectly executed everything.Two half pour-beers and a huge platter of delicious food came to twelve dollars and change. Amazing. I am a fan for life.

Well worth the wait!  Estrellon is finally open for business and serving up some amazing cuisine.  The restaurant itself was gorgeous.  Stunning woodwork, fabulous tables, and we loved the view into the open kitchen!  The bar area is completely separate from the restaurant and the perfect spot for after work, pre-show at the Overture, or after dinner drinks.  The tapas bar is in the bar area as well which is fabulous to sit and watch and drool over their wares.The drinks were delicately hand crafted.  We had the Herbs and the Bees (a blend of gin, yellow chartreuse, lavender honey) and the Monk Melon.  My Tempranillo by the glass was the perfect complement to the food as well.Most importantly, the food!!  First, if you have any questions on the menu, don't hesitate to ask your server...they perfectly explained anything we threw at them! Prepare to order a lot of plates due to smaller portions, but it's a blast to try so many different things!  Pan con Tomate was a great easy starter (fresh crushed tomatoes on toasted bread), the heirloom tomatoes were the most amazing fresh local tomatoes prepared simply with EVOO and a dusting of delicious flavors, the charred beets are served atop a crisped baguette, and the mortadella was as excellent as you'd expect from a Spanish restaurant.  We absolutely loved the seared padron peppers that were sprinkled with sea salt and the dragon tongue beans were out of this world....they are beans I know, but trust me, you need to order them along with the patatas bravas (aoli and red sauce topped frites).  We also had the brisket with chimichurri (don't think of this as a southern BBQ brisket) and the seared scallop with the most amazing fresh corn relish.The night ended on an amazing high note with dessert.  When our server recited the dessert menu, our table of 5 said yes....we want them ALL!  Best decision we made all night!  Out of this world was the basque cake served with seasonal berries (it's a delicious almond base cake that is perfectly crunchy on the outside while moist and creamy on the inside), their take on a crème brulee, sorbet with fresh berries and, of course, churros served with the most insane drinking chocolate (perfect for dunking!). We are already planning our return visit for the paella, which looked outstanding at a neighboring table!  Cheers to Tory Miller and his dedicated team for another unique and outstanding addition to Madison!If a restaurant can or could be rated on serving staff alone, then Estrellón would get five stars.Let's begin with the highlights; not the least of which was that we had quite a few staff running out at random points helping us try a few things that fun and fresh such as a few oysters on the shell with specially prepared relish.  Delicious!I follow Tory Miller's restaurants with glee (L'Etoile), and I delight in the chance to see what he was creating in the brand new renovated Ovation building (if you're going to build next to the historical Fire Station 1 on the back, let's be classy).  The staff that he chose for the new place was top-notch.  Our server was absolutely the highlight of the night, and I believe we were one of the first tables of the evening, as well as the restaurant.  Again, if kindness and good service were food enough to serve guests, I would recommend never eating anywhere else.  There are two menus at Estrellón.  One is the actual "Tapas" menu, the other is "La Cena," more of a "dinner" portion menu.  It's left a little ambiguous (notably on purpose), but essentially it's very different from most true Spanish tapas places.  The "tapas" menu is a very very much single serve (at $5+ an item), and the true shareable items are $10+.  This isn't to say that most everything wasn't absolutely delicious.  However, I do wonder, out of a tapas menu, how our table ordered more than half the tapas items to the tune of at least $150 for that portion (around $250 for the meal) and most every single item was brought out on a crostini.  Some items worked, and some very much did not (skipjack tuna with mayo just makes a tuna sandwich).When the table ordered what felt like eight/nine items and a single plate was brought out that had just a few bites, we felt as if we'd missed something. One might say, "well, you just don't understand tapas!"  Actually, we do.  Tapas, in Spain, is a round of drinks and a side dish. Order another, get another dish.  Should one desire a real hearty dish, you order one; at that point it's no longer free because you respect the chef and must now pay for the talents that you admire. Also drinks make one hungrier, cycle continuing.We scoff very much at free in the US, but tapas encourages discussion about the chef and his or her talents. Surely, prices could be adjusted to allow two bites?  Or the same ingredients on two crostini?  Some of the ingredients were piled so high that they immediately toppled over upon arrival; another piece of bread to allow more than one person to try would help.  That (if not free food) would have said to me that this restaurant understood the heart and soul of tapas: drinks and sharing.Tapas that is one item per person that does not allow sharing, individual portion (and a menu for single items, one bite each) flies in the face of everything that is the heart at soul of the cuisine.So thus, we had the "Cena" menu, but why is it different?  This was the menu that was meant to be shared, but then we had the Tapas menu?  I was not sure what the idea was behind this new way. I was there for tapas (shared portion meals), and it seemed to me that we had a very long "amuse bouche" menu that per portion would cause most parties to mistakenly blow through a dinner budget before ever getting to the real "tapas."My confusion aside, the drink selections were wonderful, and the wine list was phenomenal, but this isn't unusual.  Our party was not filled with wine drinkers, and we mocked ourselves a bit for that. Again, this is going to make some people feel not at home.  Sadly, the beer taps were out - but they do have a tap list that I hear is coming soon.  We look forward to returning for that.My crowning sadness of the evening, and the removal of one last star for me was the Paella.I have a special fondness for Valencian paella, and there would be a special cultural shock for a Spanish person; Valencian traditional paella is not seafood paella. Valencia does in fact have seafood paella, but the two are never mixed. Estrellón's version is made with the traditional Bomba rice and was very aromatic, but when I ordered the paella for two (at $45 a plate), I was hoping to see the happy sight of a giant steaming paellara. While I did read the description beforehand and knew it would be mixed, I was not expecting to see the smallest paellara in the world filled with very little come out to the table. It was very overcooked (paella is supposed to rest for 10 minutes, but not be dry and cool). The purposefully burned 'socarrat' at the bottom was black, when it should be toasty brown.Estrellón left me with many questions as to what it wants to accomplish and that brought my rating down.  I had a decent meal, but it came at the expense of having no food fun with my group - and it didn't feel at all like tapas, it felt like a string of appetizers that I couldn't share.I came for Tapas, but I'm not sure that's what I received.I could not be more disappointed with Estrellón. If you enjoy paying $1 per shishito pepper or $.50 per white bean, then this is your place.Besides the absurdity of menu prices (come full, don't eat, leave almost as full because WTF), the food can consider itself mediocre at best. It's not at all in league with similarly priced places in Madison (especially those places that charge this ridiculous amount for nearly no food on a plate WHICH IS NONE) and not worth your time. Please. Not. Worth. Your. Time.We literally laughed as the plates came to our table. Decor could be considered "fancy joke hahah."It was also nice when we were trying to be sold on the most expensive glass of wine in the restaurant that our waitress wouldn't even tell us about.

NOTE: Yelp has two listings for this business but even after submitting edits, will not remove or merge them. The other page is under Jin Jin You Wei. Not sure what the deal is, or if that's just a translation. Former space occupied by Island Malaysian #2, in the same building as Ichiza.Now that that's out of the way...Went in to grab takeout, was the only customer for dinner at 7PM on a weekday. Small order took literally half an hour to come out and the food was mediocre.Ordered the steamed dumplings and lamb pancake. Dumplings were mushy, overcooked, and bland. Taste and appearance were identical to what you'd get frozen in a bag at the grocery store and boiling yourself. Pancake contained a small portion of flavorful lamb- too bad it was overshadowed by all the grease. Opened the takeout box to a puddle of oil. picked up the pancake and had it all over my hands, bit in and got a mouthful of it too. Gross!Service was dismal at best. As the only customer, the wait time was unacceptable and no excuse or apology was given. I found it frustrating that the dumplings only come 10/order and cannot be mixed and matched with other flavors or styles. I thought it was a reasonable request, and possibly one they should consider in light of their lack of customers as a new business. Server barely spoke to me, not even when dropping off or picking up my bill.

I don't get why this place has a 4.5 average rating. I JUST finished eating (what I managed to eat) and after 1 short rib, I was over it. Look at all my pictures, and you'll see what I'm talking about. Short ribs: waaaaaaay too much fat. After eating just 1 short rib, I had a big pile of fat sitting on a napkin. And nibbling on the bones is usually my favorite part about short ribs. I couldn't do it with these because I refuse to eat pure fat.Furikake chicken: the majority of the serving was the crumbs/breading. There were only a few big pieces of chicken. Korean short ribs: mushy and all breading. Don't get me wrong, the flavoring of the short ribs and furikake chicken were good, but the execution was a huge disappointment. Sometimes trying new places isn't always a good thing.Big flavor. Big portions. Head to Island Flavor Express!People who lived in Hawaii are blessed that Vegas is the 9th island. You don't have to go far to get some Island grinds. The newest addition to Henderson is located in the shopping area on Eastern Ave & Pebble. Same owners as Island Flavor on Durango, they are a casual place-order/pick-up order or take-out service style restaurant. The staff has been incredibly friendly on each visit and the place is clean and simple, with about 6 tables inside. Food I've ordered:Furikake Ahi PokeHawaiian-Style PokeKalbi RibsFurikake Chicken & ShrimpFurikake Chicken - Let's cut to the chase. I don't even eat chicken. The batter and glaze they use is insane, I couldn't help but try a few pieces that were just crumb batter. OMG. Sweet and salty deliciousness! My boyfriend and toddler loved it, too. I tried the shrimp version, and they over-fried it, so I wasn't as happy with it. Poke - The portion they give are great. The fish is cubed into good sizes. However, I can't say it's the best I've had. The fish tastes good, but I prefer the poke to have been marinated longer. Melt-in-your-mouth kind of poke...Kalbi - Ridiculous portion and the meat is tender! Look at the posted pictures below.Desserts - They have a rotating selection found in the fridge by the door, so you can self-serve and take it to the counter. I have yet to try any, but I've seen Chantilly, Haupia, Guava Chiffon, and Coco Puffs. They also stock Hawaiian Sun canned drinks.Look at their chalkboard for their daily specials. They serve Lau Lau on Fridays and I've seen Mahi Mahi and Kalua Pig posted, too.This has become one of those regular stops I'll make when I want some quick but tasty Hawaiian eats for the family. I'd love it if they could start serving oxtail soup and malasadas! That's the only thing I can say they are missing. But I'd highly recommend stopping by if you're hungry in Hendertucky!I expected a really mindblowing experience after all the hype around the original location and the positive comparisons drawn between the two, but the Eastern outpost of this restaurant lands merely in the "really good" category.Island Flavor Express is in the Regal Colonnade plaza on Eastern and Pebble, and it's very clearly a Hawaiian restaurant given all the depictions of the islands, reggae/ska music, and typical plate lunch menu options. They also offer varying specials and some desserts, although the desserts seemed to have run out in the waning evening hours. The decor is very simple but doesn't detract from the experience. Make sure to walk to the far end of the counter to place an order, but feel free to sit down if you're not taking it to-go. They'll bring the food out to your counter (or table, if you've picked the one table).I ordered the mixed plate ($11.25) with Furikake Chicken and Kalbi Short Ribs (+$1.00 for this particular meat). It's presented in a foam to-go box even if you're dining in. My favorite part was actually the macaroni salad, which was salted in a good way, and as creamy as you'd expect. The chicken was kinda like the "KFC" at Gen Korean BBQ in a not-so-good way. It has more of a dry, stringy texture than a moist, natural chicken texture, and the furikake didn't stand out as much as the sweet glaze did. Sriracha saved the day though, bestowing a little extra sweetness along with much-needed acidity and heat. I don't like having to add a condiment to make something stand out, but I'm very glad that I had the option.As for the other parts of the dish, the white rice is cooked perfectly, and the kalbi is a great rendition with tender beef, a nice touch of ginger, and some charring. It's a little on the fatty side, but let's remember that fat = flavor, which was proven in this case. Actually, it has muted sweetness when you eat it after something as sweet as the Furikake Chicken, but I was able to taste the full flavor when I dove into my my leftovers. If I get a mixed plate again with kalbi, I'll probably have to go for something like a pork dish that's not so sweet.My friend shared a spam musubi ($2) with me. It was a nice-sized portion, but the rice ratio was a bit high for me. Also, the seaweed was a little too mushy, which my friend pointed out may be a side-effect of the heat lamp. Although there are interesting seasonings and herbs in Island Flavor's version, I prefer the Ross J's rendition, which I'm sure is prepped to order.I also tried my friend's oxtail soup ($10), which actually comes in a real bowl if you're dining in. Unfortunately, I can't compare it to the renowned Hawaiian oxtail soup at that one hotel downtown (because I've yet to try it), but this version tasted well-seasoned and meaty. The vegetables are a welcome sight, but watch out for the not-so-edible ginger and the inedible bay leaf. I'd consider ordering it again, especially now that we're getting soup weather daily, although I might have to make it a to-go order or otherwise bring my own soup spoon to avoid dealing with the inadequate plastic spoons.Given that the food here is reportedly much the same as OG Island Flavor, I wasn't quite as impressed as I'd hoped. I certainly enjoyed having plenty of leftovers with the huge portions, and I'll definitely come back to try their other proteins and specials (pork chops w/ mushrooms and onions, anyone?), but I expected to experience something "sublime" other than the music. Maybe I'll find it in the future.

Nums!!! It's really sad to see that Simon restaurant is no longer, but this new burger bar is pretty darn good. The burn your face off is a great explanation of how your taste buds are going to be feeling. If you can't handle the heat, stay away from this burger .. My friend had the pull pork burger "the smoke out??" Something like that .. Like anything with BBQ sauce expect to get messy with this one ... Finally the Dr. Pepper burger .. A pretty thick portobello mushroom paired with a burger and grilled onions .. My least favorite of the 3 choices that were had. The burger was just too sweet (yes sweeter than the BBQ burger). Oh and you can't leave without trying dessert! Def need to try their nutella shake .. Okay I have more to say, but I'm getting hungry all over again .. I should've taken photos also .. Next time!Cafe 6 is the new cafe inside of the Palms Place casino. It replaces the Simon restaurant that was there for a long time. I wanted to check out what was different, and what was the same. There are some similarities, plus some differences, so I will go into detail.This restaurant is located on the 6th floor of the Palms Place. There is self parking and valet options all around, so just take the elevator to the 6th floor when you come inside of Palms Place. After walking through to the restaurant, I was immediately sat by the hostess, given my menu, and my server came by shortly and asked about my drink order. Looking around the restaurant, I noticed that they didn't do a major overhaul of the dining room, which is a good thing because the dining room does look elegant and comfortable, with great views of the pool and people watching.While perusing the menu, I noticed that the humorously whimsical Kerry Simon menu has been replaced by a simpler, more straightforward one, with a focus on being more casual and approachable. There is a wide variety of crowd pleasing favorites such as burgers, salads, sandwiches, as well as appetizers including chicken wings, and pretzels. I came in during lunch time, and during that time I was handed a drink menu that was full of standard beers, but also had a large selection of craft ones. I chose an IPA called Le Freak by a brewery in California called Green Flash. It was a hoppy beer that complimented my meal very well. The server took my food order and I waited for my food.There seemed to be a mixup in the ordering when my food arrived. I had ordered a couple appetizers and a burger meal. The burger came out first, rather than the appetizers. I didn't really mind since I'm not crazy anal like that, but my preference would be the other way around on most occasions.   So first, the burger. I ordered the Land and Sea. The burger was cooked to a perfect medium rare, just as I had requested. It was also seasoned well, and was hot and juicy. I could tell that they are using quality beef for their burgers. The crab dynamite was fresh. The condiments were subtle and very fresh, and the bun was toasted nicely, and held its shape very well. There is a choice of fries that comes with all the burgers, and I chose the waffle fries. They were hot and crispy, and seasoned well.Next were my appetizers. I ordered the chicken wings and beer battered rock shrimp. First, the wings. They used the big sized ones, which I appreciated. They were good wings, and sauced well. As for the rock shrimp, the batter was light and crispy, and the rock shrimp were fresh and of good quality. Here's a tip, eat the shrimp together with the celery, you're welcome.My server was really good, she asked if I was doing well and if the food was good, which it was. I thought they had priced their menu extremely well, taking into consideration that this is a casino restaurant.Suffice to say, I was really pleased with my meal, and would come back again. This is a spot that's making very solid food, with good quality product. The service is good and I enjoyed myself here.I was invited to come to Café 6 by PR at the Palms and was comped our meal.  We arrived when they opened at 5 PM and were seated along the window that faces the Palms Place pool.  Menus were left and in a very short time, our server, Alejandro, arrived to take drink orders.  He was soon back with our two iced teas.I had a question about the Burn Your Face Off burger and with Alejandro's description, I opted to go with something that would leave my face in tact--overhaul though it needs.  I ordered the Land and sea burger which the menu describes as Angus Beef, CRAB DYNAMITE, Red Onions, Fennel, Arugula, Breakfast Radishes, Havarti Cheese, Tomato Tartar Sauce, Hawaiian Sweet Bun.  I asked for it rare and that's the way it came.  My wife ordered the Dr. Pepper/Shroom burger that the menu describes as Angus Beef, Roasted Portabella, White Cheddar, Caramelized Onions, DR. PEPPER GLAZE, Dijon Mustard, Brioche Bun done medium which was the way it was done.  We each ordered skinny fries which come with your sandwich.Both burgers were very good.  I was pleased that my burger was indeed rare, something that some restaurants are hesitant to do.  The burgers were very large--probably 8 ounces.  My burger, while having a good amount of crab, didn't have much of a crab taste.  The crab was mined and mixed with a hot sauce to be the dynamite mentioned in the menu.  There wasn't much dynamite to it, but the burger was good.  The skinny fries were salted in the kitchen and were the perfect accompaniment to the burger.For dessert, we split the To Die For Chocolate which the menu describes as Chocolate Ice Cream, Frozen Brownie Bites, TOASTED MARSHMALLOWS, Crème Anglaise.  This was very good.  Very chocolatey--very worthy of its name!Throughout our meal, service was top notch.  Our iced teas were refilled without needing to ask.  Alejandro was very good!Café 6 would probably rate another star if there was more of a choice.  Except for burgers and sandwiches, there are only two "main course" options--salmon and steak frites--so it's a burger and sandwich café with some apps, salads, and desserts.  There is an option to build your own burger.  The price of the burgers amounts to Strip pricing in an off-Strip place.  While the room and the view of the pool are very nice, this isn't a stop I'd make.  It's much easier to get gourmet burgers in the neighborhood at more reasonable prices.  For tourists staying at the Palms or Palms Place, this is a perfectly good option.We were invited to Café 6 at Palms Place for a comped meal.  Located on the 6th floor, this hideaway has a very inviting, upscale feel, with floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking the pool.We were attended to immediately by Jeannette, our wonderful server.  Though the restaurant has what looks like a classy, full bar, there is no cocktail list.  There is no wine list.  Instead, the restaurant is selling off what remains from its predecessor's wine collection, and will not be replacing it.  Huh????The only Riesling available was the one we both dislike.  Instead I ordered an Ace Pineapple Cider from the Beer/Cider menu, and hubby had a Sierra Nevada.   If you don't like either, you're SOL.  Or, you could have a million-calorie shake to go along with your This is Not Health Food meal.  They're probably delicious.  Fattening stuff always is (except for Fried Twinkies).  It IS nice that they stock a selection of local brews, but as a non-beer drinker, the lack of wine is a huge turn-off for me.  The pineapple cider was interesting - tasty, but too sweet even for me.We started with the Baked Soft Pretzel, an enormous creature served with Dijon Mustard & Warm Cheese Sauce.  Loved it, but needed to make room for dinner, so it was the first entry in the take-home bag.We ordered a Dr. Pepper/Shroom burger for me, without the Dr. Pepper Glaze.  I never liked that soda, but did want all the other stuff on it:  the Roasted Portabello, White Cheddar, Caramelized Onions, and Dijon Mustard on a Brioche Bun.  I asked for it medium, and it was slightly less than that, but in the good 'ol days I would get my burgers medium-rare, so I was fine with it, Health Dept. be damned.Mr. G. got the Smokehouse Burger, and he enjoyed it a lot.  We ordered one with onion rings and one with waffle fries, well-done.  The onion rings were humungous, and I didn't dare eat more than one.  The waffle fries were perfect:  crisp, well-done but not burnt, simply scrumptious.  I couldn't even finish my burger, and we took home a lot of fries and the remaining onion rings.We finished up with dessert - the To Die For Chocolate.  We were too full to go the whole nine yards, so we asked for the ice cream to be served and all the other stuff packed to go.  We did miss the beautiful presentation that I've seen in some of the photos posted here, but the three scoops of chocolate ice cream that were served to us made me almost comatose, 'cause I ate too much of it.Café 6 has a lot going for it:  great atmosphere, big and tasty burgers, rings, fries, pretzels, desserts, stellar service.  But not so great menu:  just TWO entrees, a few "sammiches" that don't sound particularly enticing, a bar that looks like a bar, but maybe it's just a mirage (oh, that's a different hotel), Strip pricing.  If you're craving a burger and a beer, this may just be your place.I loved the décor and poolside setting when this spot was Simon's, but service was terrible. Glad to see that Café 6 has tasty burgers and a total turnaround in the service department- but the cuisine doesn't really fit the spa-like locale. That said, I'd still keep this spot in mind for a great burger.FRIED PICKLES: These are spears instead of the expected chips, perfectly crisp and served with a trio of dipping sauces (an acidic ranch, a sweet bbq, and a spicy sriracha). Interesting presentation features vinegar chips under the pickles? THE WEDGIE: More like a wedge salad mated with a BLTA sandwich, minus the bread. Presentation deconstructed the wedge to more manageable pieces,  with generous amounts of avocado and bleu cheese, two slices of bacon. One of the few fresh/healthy options, lots of textural contrast, would get again.MINI BURGERSTURKEY SNACK: Turkey burger with lettuce, avocado, swiss, and apple-cranberry marmalade on a Taro bun. The purple taro bun is fun and slightly sweet, tastes like a Hawaiian roll. This is a great turkey burger, surprisingly juicy.BACON BLEU: Angus patty with bacon (allegedly, didn't detect any on ours?), bleu cheese sauce, LTO, on brioche bun. Lovely buttery bun and an incredibly strong sauce, burger was juicy, a bite of perfection.TOADSTOOL SWISS: Angus patty with roasted portabella, caramelized onion, lettuce, swiss, Dijon mustard, house-made ketchup. The burger I'd most anticipated was underwhelming. Portabella lacked flavor, mustard didn't really harmonize with other ingredients, small chopped onions were falling all over the plate and didn't stay on the burger.FULL-SIZE BURGERDR. PEPPER SHROOM BURGER: Huge, thick Angus patty with roasted portabella, white cheddar, caramelized onion, Dr. Pepper glaze, Dijon mustard on brioche bun. The full sized burgers are gigantic! Aside from our cooking issues (below), the sweet Dr. Pepper glaze worked better than expected and added to the mushrooms' savory meatiness. Really enjoyed the flavors of this burger. WAFFLE FRIES: These are perfectly crisp and wonderfully seasoned, served with a spicy ketchup with a lot of kick. I ate way too many of these, enjoying them more than any other version in recent memory.NUTELLA DONUTS: Puffy donut holes, dusted in cinnamon-sugar and served with a trio of sauces (the crème anglaise being my favorite). Nutella filling was a good amount, not overflowing, happy my BF pushed to order these despite my not being a dessert fan.  I recommend the Trio of Sliders ($14), which allows you to try more burger styles, though the giant patty of the full-size burger is a good value. The sliders were cooked perfectly, whereas our full-sized burger was served first overcooked (to well done) then redone to practically rare. If you're charging $15/burger, every one should be cooked perfectly- an area to improve upon.Service was fairly good: lots of positive staff around to check up on us, they had no problem remaking our burger or upselling drinks, apps, and desserts. Now if only they could get people in the door! Despite a Friday evening date-night, there were few diners here and they were mostly older groups. Location away from the casino floor plus $15 burgers (pricey for some) doesn't really help. Hoping this place lasts as a concept (as I want to return for the bbq brisket burger!) , but it doesn't really fit the location.Confused why they have 5 stars, but oh well. We came here after we checked into the Palms Place and were disappointed with the food. The service, however, was fantastic. Our server was amazing and definitely went the extra mile to take care of us. He was really excited and kept the energy high even though we were both incredibly tired. We ordered the Rock Shrimp appetizer, I ordered a "Build Your Own" turkey burger, he ordered their "Smokeout" (which is apparently what they are known for) and we also had the sweet potato and skinny fries. The shrimp appetizer was okay. It wasn't great or absolutely terrible. I think the batter could have been a little better and fried a little longer, and I don't think they should toss it in the Tobasco Ranch. I LOVE Tobasco, however it made it really soggy. This was probably the best thing we ordered. My turkey burger was really bland. I got the normal toppings on it (lettuce, tomato, onions) and added mushrooms. They put way too many onions on there and it was an overwhelming taste. Usually I don't complain about that because I do like onions, but they must have given me half of an onion. The Smokeout looked unappetizing and he said he was really unhappy with it. I didn't even want to try it. The sweet potato fries were pretty good but a tad too salty. We didn't come back here, although we would have if the food was good. It's convenient if you want something basic...like fries. I don't recommend this place.I'm not a burger person. I was skeptical about coming here... But I am a total fan. It's located in palms place where the old Simons use to be. We went on a Sunday night... It wasn't busy... But it definitely should be! We were greeted immediately and sat a comfortable table. Our server was an amazing young man from back east. Dang, I wish I remembered his name... Probably the best service I've had out in a long time. We ordered the pretzel as an app. Actually... My boyfriend and his friend ordered it. It was huge! A total mealWithin itself and definitely not vegan... But appeared to be extremely enjoyable. I ordered a glass of wine and the Virgin lettuce wraps... Holy smokes!!! They were super flavorful... Totally vegan... And absolutely delicious! Score!! My boyfriend ordered 3 pork belly sliders and fries and our friend ordered the chicken Caesar salad. Everyone loved their food. Of course... We left with left overs... But it was absolutely delicious. Will I be returning? Definitely!

Restaurant name  Blue Ribbon Fried Chicken

Review Text :
Cluck yeah, fried chicken! The newest spot to hit downtown Summerlin features the Bromberg brothers' take on your favorite fried feathered friend, available in tenders, wings, and sandwiches, with sides, salads, and sodas. That's a lot of alliteration.SANDWICHES: The classic Blue Ribbon sandwich is a solid offering with special sauce, while the Bluebird kicks it up with blue cheese, red onion, and bacon. The chicken for both was super-juicy without being greasy, but the breading didn't adhere very well and the chicken itself didn't have much flavor. I appreciate that the blue cheese on the Bluebird is more of a sauce than crumbles, allowing for more even distribution of flavor.SIDES: A small is just under $4, while a large is just over $7. Steep. Mashed potatoes didn't taste instant but also weren't worth the price. The small fry is a huge portion of skinny-cut seasoned spuds, great for sampling all of their dipping sauces!DIPPING SAUCES: BRBQ (bourbon-tinged barbecue), Chipotle honey (possibly my favorite), habanero hot (is hot), wasabi honey (very slight wasabi flavor), and a couple of others. I felt that the sauces were a nice touch, but wish the chicken itself had more flavor. The multitude of sauces seem to be compensating.SODAS: Their fountain drink station features cane-sugar sodas. I'm not generally a soda fan, but there was no button for water so I sampled a few and was surprised to really enjoy them. The ginger ale, crème soda, lemon-lime, and black cherry, in that order, were my top picks. There were a few I didn't try.SERVICE. Here's where I'm torn on what to rate this place. I understand I went on their second day, but I experienced a few hiccups (charged incorrectly, then brought the wrong order). However, management was quick to apologize and fix the issues, and the service from one employee in the dining room in particular was awesome. Rounding up for that dude.Overall, this spot is a bit overpriced for what you get, but it's in downtown Summerlin so no one's really surprised. Recommend the wing lunchbox combo (5 wings, fries, and a drink for $8) for a better value, only available 11-3PM, Mon-Fri.EDIT: Dropping a star. Returned for another visit, still had issues with my order. This time I didn't bother bringing it to their attention. You've been open two months and the kitchen still doesn't know the menu? Retrain your staff or hire new people who care.My coworker who usually shows zero emotion showed so much emotion and raved about how delicious the fried chicken was at Blue Ribbon on the Strip, so I was stoked when this place opened! I really wanted to love this place since I LOVE fried chicken, but the bf and I were sorely disappointed after eating there last night. The menu had plenty of options with tenders, boneless thighs, wings, sandwiches, salads, sides, 3 draft beers, and cane sugar sodas. We each decided to go with the 2 pc tender meal ($9.75), a boneless thigh ($3.75), and a cane sugar soda ($2.75). The 2 pc tender meal came with a side of cole slaw and shoestring fries. Each table was stocked with a variety of sauces: Bahhhbq, Chipotle Honey, Wasabi Honey, Habanero Hot Sauce (their house hot sauce though personally I prefer buffalo), and... I feel like there was one more besides plain ketchup but I can't remember.We were pretty excited and did our fair share of taking pictures of our food (we're THOSE ppl, I know) before diving in. Everything was alright - started with the fries which were pretty good, tenders had great breading and seasoning but were a little on the dry side in both orders, cole slaw was fresh and vinegary, and the ginger ale soda was refreshing. The seasoning on the chicken is already delicious itself so I didn't think there was much need for the sauces unless you were using the sauce to make the dry tenders more juicy. Overall, the above mentioned were good though I'd swap out the tenders to try the wings.Here comes the big disappointment and my primary reason for dropping it from a 3 star to a 1: our boneless fried chicken thigh was UNCOOKED in the center!! It looked perfectly fried on the outside and we had started to peel off some of the chicken skin to eat and were excited because it was seasoned well and crispy, but upon tearing the thigh open we noticed the entire center was uncooked! Thank goodness neither of us jumped the gun and bit straight into the chicken thigh. It would be understandable (though still unacceptable) if maybe a tiny bit of the chicken was UNDERcooked, but we literally had an UNcooked center. It took us a moment to process the raw chicken we were staring at before bringing it to the counter to show them. The cashier that helped us said sorry and said they would redo the 2 boneless thighs. A few mins later we got back up to ask when they would be done and requested it to go since we had lost our appetites already. The gentleman that spoke with us seemed to be one of the supervisors but showed less apologetic emotion than the cashier. Meh. Our thighs were finally ready and was brought to our table boxed up with fries, a bottle of their habanero hot sauce, and a chocolate shake. The manager (I'm assuming) apologized and was very courteous. It was nice of them to throw in the extras along with our new order of thighs, but it wasn't able to erase our disappointment. When we walked out, there was a guy standing outside texting that sorta looked like Bruce Bromberg? but maybe not... Couldn't really tell because it was dark and he had glasses on. Anyway, he said, "sorry again guys. They pulled the wrong piece out of the fryer too early."  Ah, so that's why... Yikes?!?!Maybe I'll give this place another chance eventually, but definitely not for a really really long time. I understand they just opened and may experience hiccups, but what a rookie, gross, and dangerous mistake to make on chicken when you're a fried chicken restaurant. There's too many other dining options in Downtown Summerlin for them to risk making a mistake this big. Overall- Service could improve to be more consistent from all employees. Dining room was clean and had TVs. I recommend taking a close gander at your chicken to make sure it's edible before consuming.To the owners of Blue Ribbon Fried Chicken, I would like to offer my heartfelt apologies just in case the spirit of my dearly departed grandmother appears and hits you with her cast iron skillet.  Yes...your chicken is that good.As a transplant from the Great American Southeast, I am somewhat of a chicken snob, and have been continually amazed at the lack of quality fried fowl west of the Mississippi.  One of my fondest childhood memories is of grandma's cast iron skillet fried chicken.  Every Thursday night was chicken night, and man could she fricassee a bird.   It wasn't a meal as much as it was an event.After joining the Navy in the 80's (yeah I'm and old dude) and moving to San Diego, I realized that the only easily attainable fried chicken was from the Colonel.  It may have been good stuff a long time ago when he was fryin' it up himself at his roadside diner, but in the decades that have followed Pepsi Co. has done an excellent job of turning it into an over-salted, polymer-laced, fast food facsimile of a bone-in Chicken McNugget.  Put another way...yuck.Having recently moved to Summerlin Las Vegas, my wife and I have spent our weekends exploring the Valley's ample food scene.  To my chagrin however, all the highly touted chicken joints in town have fallen flat.  It seemed as if we were doomed to seek what pleasure we could from a greasy bucket of corporate squab emblazoned with the Colonel's evil grinning face.  I can almost see him in his secret control room under Mount Charleston, laughing maniacally as he watches us on the mini-cam inserted in one of our thighs by regional marketing.  Yeah, I know he is dead...or is he?Then, just today, as I was strolling through Downtown Summerlin wondering what I would have for lunch, I stumbled upon Blue Ribbon Fried Chicken.  "How good could this possibly be," I thought to myself as I stopped to look at the menu.   After all, I am sure it is just a KFC in disguise.  Skepticism aside, I was intrigued so I threw caution to the wind, went in, and ordered their "Two Thigh" dinner.  I waited about 10 minutes for my meal, and when it arrived it was fresh and beautifully prepared.  If you are a connoisseur of chicken, you know when you see a special piece of bird, and this was one of those moments.  I had not seen such a thigh since Baywatch was cancelled. This is where Grandma starts getting mad...The coating was crisp, well-seasoned, and created a wonderful shell for the moist and tender thigh meat inside.  I doused my first bite with an ample portion of wildflower honey and began slip back in time.  I looked into the open kitchen and, just for a moment, thought I saw grandmother working the fryer.  This was good stuff.  After a couple more bites of my glorious bird, I tasted my side of collard greens and was pleased to see that Blue Ribbon had gotten them right too.  It tasted just like it had come out of a South Georgia pressure cooker.  Grandma is really beside herself at this point...Finally I took a deep swig of iced tea and was pleased to discover that Blue Ribbon knew their brew. Tea is extremely important in the south.  We drink it more than Budweiser at a NASCAR race, and it can make or break a meal.  In these days of soda fountain tea-flavored chemicals, a Pepsi Co. invention no doubt, finding an establishment that serves real tea is always refreshing. Grandma is now raising the skillet over her head...In the final analysis, I have determined that Blue Ribbon Fried Chicken may well make some of the best fried chicken I have had the pleasure of consuming.  Grandma swings...  I am not sure if it is fast food or not but, in the words of the late Justin Wilson, it is so good you will want to stand up an' slap someone...but don't...just enjoy your meal.  Grandma's pan finds its target...sorry guys.With a little fine tuning this spot could be excellent. The first time I stopped by the tenders were soggy and oily. But on subsequent visits the wings have been crispy and the Blue Bird sandwich has become one of my favorite chicken sandwiches around. I like the seasoning on the tenders and wings, but remember the crust being thicker and crunchier at Brooklyn Bowl, which is also owned by the Bromberg brothers. A kid's meal only comes with one tender. I wish they used a more mild seasoning for the kid's meals. My guy didn't care for the spices. While I do like this place, prices are too high for a fast casual spot to make me a frequent visitor. The 2 piece tender meal didn't fill me up and that was around $12 for the meal plus a drink. I understand the quality is higher than fast food spots, but I can't spend $15 or more on lunch on a regular basis. If I bring the family the price triples. The best bargain is the lunchbox special (available M-F 11am-4pm) which includes 5 wings, fries, and a drink.Items Selected:Nutella, Vanilla, and Caramel ShakesHush PuppiesSmorgasbird - Lettuce, Cucumbers, Tomatoes, Chicken Cutlets, Pineapple Slices, Pickles, Fries, Sour Cream, Cheddar Cheese, Bacon, Sauteed BBQ Chicken, Pickled Peppers2 Strips, 2 WingsAdobo CornCollards & BaconFounded by the Bromberg Brothers and featuring the duo's first foray into the 'burbs, Blue Ribbon Fried Chicken arrived in Downtown Summerlin by way of New York earlier this summer and although the quick casual concept has been questioned for high prices as well as uneven cooking ever since opening it was with a friend and his child that I sat down for lunch on Saturday, almost every off-putting rumor soon confirmed.Nicely lit and well adorned with amenities including motion sensing trash compactors, LCD televisions, housemade sauces, plus a fountain featuring artisan sodas from Boylan's, a visit to Blue Ribbon begins at a counter with smiling servers - the dining decisions largely sandwiches, combos, and sides with additional options for shakes or salads, plus single tenders, wings, or thighs.Taking note of a few specials, the August-only "Smorgasbird" with a portion of the proceeds benefiting  Multiple Sclerosis offered in addition to perplexingly priced hush puppies - $3.75 for a half-dozen or $7.95 for ten - it was after some perusal that an order soon completed, the fifteen minute wait with one of those vibrating flashy buzzers spent sitting in one of several unpadded booths.Certainly not a cheap meal, the total before tax and tip north of $55 for what would prove less than enough to sate a family of four were it not for the three excellent pieces of egg bread wrapped around the charitable sandwich, it was largely a matter of principle that the Smorgasbird was ordered and with two boneless cutlets spiced quite unlike the Bromberg chicken at Blue Ribbon or Brooklyn Bowl suffice it to say that each piece was almost too dry on its own to be enjoyable, the better bites found in barbequed bits serve atop cheesy fries tinged in peppers while anemic looking tomatoes made one question sourcing during the ingredients peak time of year.Finding the tenders to be as oddly spiced and devoid of moisture as the cutlets while wings at least maintained their texture thanks to the presence of a bone, it was onward to sides that the meal progressed and although the hushpuppies were each quite small the flavors of sweet corn were thankfully prominent, the same not to be said of soft collards barely bolstered by pork let alone the 'adobo corn' which certainly would have benefited greatly from some salt.At this point seeing the emperor for his lack of clothes while wondering why the duo opts to change their chicken at each venue when the original version is the one that earned them such acclaim, it was in a trio of shakes that the meal concluded and although none were particularly innovative each was clearly crafted of good ice cream, the vanilla trending a bit thin and mellow while the Nutella and caramel were decidedly sweet and thick enough to stick a spoon up straight.Overpriced and overseasoned with little more than a 'name' to justify the hype Blue Ribbon Fried Chicken joins the likes of most of Downtown Summerlin's imported eateries, a situation that makes one wonder just how long the public will continue to bite.

Review Text :
We went here for lunch today and were extremely impressed.  The staff was very friendly and accommodating and the pizza was delicious.  The crust was crispy and didn't get soggy due to the sauce like most other pizzas I have had. The Trio pizza is a great alternative to a plain pepperoni pizza with fresh basil, mozzerella, and ricotta. You can taste that all the ingredients are fresh.  Pizzeria Omaggio is a great addition to the Charlotte pizza scene and other pizzerias should take note!I have been here a couple times now and am really enjoying it. There are a handful of restaurants that could learn from Pizzeria Omaggio's owner/manager - he is always there and actively engaged in the front and back. He recognizes my wife and I, always making conversation and recommendations. It's nice when you can put a face to the business. The pizza is great and is made right behind the counter. The trio and Omaggio special are fantastic. They are about 11 inches and can be shared. You can also build your own from a lengthy variety of ingredients. The soups and salads are on my list of dishes to try on my next visit - they look delicious coming out of the kitchen. Pizzeria Omaggio has put a lot of work into the interior. Clean and bright with marble counters. They have made the space their own - something that the previous pizzeria in this location failed at. I am optimistic that Pizzeria Omaggio will stick around for a while. They are doing everything right and has been well received from what I have been reading.The Mr and I were excited to try a brand new pizza spot in the neighborhood so we walked in mid-afternoon on a Friday to see what was up. We were greeted by friendly staff and were quite impressed with the decor and ordering counter setup. Our selection was a 4 cheese pizza and one with eggplant, red pepper and balsamic as well as a couple of canned drinks. This is where it got disappointing. From my first bite of pizza I realized that something was missing. Salt. Yep. The crust was just boring. No flavor (although the texture was really nice).The pizza toppings were fine...or would have been, had they been properly seasoned. The balsamic was somehow not piquant at all. I waited for the Mr's reaction and it was identical to mine. We both covered our pizzas in what our friends' kids call "shakey cheese" or the table-side Parmesan that was brought out with our meal. Honestly, it was one of the only ways we made it through. So here we were, wondering if we had missed something because both our pizzas were sauce-less. Maybe if we had ordered a pie with their marinara, the salinity of the sauce would have perked things up. So the Mr walked back up to the counter and asked for some of their marinara. And it tasted like unseasoned stewed tomatoes. Service is impeccable. Space is perfect. Setup is simple. Food...well, maybe we just went on an off day. I know they're probably working out some kinks. Go see for yourself. Maybe you'll have a different experience than we did.

Formerly a Custom Built Pizza, this location has been completely remodeled and transformed into a nice Indian restaurant with lunch buffet ($11) and a la carte dinner. Appears to be family owned and operated, service is polite and prompt.Upon entry and seating, you are immediately asked for your naan preference (plain vs garlic, go for the garlic!) and released to the buffet- incredible samosas, two types of rice, 5 vegetarian dishes, 5 meat dishes,  soup, and a simple fruit/salad/condiment bar. Standouts for me were the garlic naan, the incredible samosas, and a robust but not spicy goat curry. I found the tandoori chicken a bit try, the available soup too peppery, and was disappointed not to find saag paneer. Even so, I'd keep this spot in mind if I'm on this side of town and in need of a carb load... or just more incredible samosas!

My family has been looking forward to giving this new BBQ restaurant here in Surprise a try for a long time.  After countless delays, and missed opportunities due to the restaurant being closed we had our chance!  Since there are three of us, we decided on the family meal with slaw and beans as sides.  Our first choice was cheesy potatoes, but as often is the case mentioned in other reviews, they were out of something.  Overall I will say the menu is pretty limited, and you shouldn't expect to find the variety you would find at a Rudys, or Honey Bears.  As for the food, put it this way.  We ended up throwing most of everything out and going to plan B.  The positive was the lean quality of the pulled pork.  That's where it ends however.  The meat had absolutely no flavor, the store bought hamburger rolls they give you tasted stale, the BBQ sauce tasted only like ketchup, the beans had no flavor or texture, and the slaw was dry and loaded with ground pepper.  I rate "Got Que? " a two out of five based on the lean quality of the pork and friendly staff.  Overall however I just literally throw $25 in the trash, and just don't see a reason to return.  Sadly, if you want quality "Que", you will have to keep making the drive to outside of Surprise.

Experience:  my friend Lance (check out his review on here) tried this place an raved about the food. So he invited a few friends to come try it out. We came around 7:00 for dinner. Facility: beautiful!  This is a very upscale, modern decor with heavy Indian influence. So beautifully done!!! They have tables and chairs, bar seating, and some booths. They have some outside seating coming soon too!  I loved being able to look around and having some things to look at...from the Ballywood-esque mural, to the beautiful window treatments. I have to mention the seats were pretty comfortable too, which is rare in a restaurant. Service:  This is the only reason, I'm marking them down. Otherwise they would have a 5 star from me. They are very polite servers; however, the first thing we ordered, was my cheese naan and the eggplant. This was my main meal. The cheese naan was the last thing that came out, after asking 4 times for it.  I was actually full eating other folks food by the time I got it. One waitress I questioned on the status said they didn't even have cheese naan, although it was on the menu. Then she brought another Garlic naan instead. When they finally brought my naan, they said the extra garlic naan they brought by mistake was on them.  Of course!  How about comping my cheese naan instead!  They also took forever to bring out another friends Chicken Marsala. Hopefully they get it together soon. I do love how personable the staff was, and the owner even came out to greet and talk to us.Food:  A-maz-ing!  I love Indian food and this did not disappoint.  Everything we had was good...honestly, there was nothing I disliked. We ordered a lot, so I will try to remember all we ordered. We asked for everything very hot on the spicy scale. Cheese naan - 5/5 so good and cheesy!!!Garlic naan - 5/5 hot and fresh!Basmati rice - we had order rice to go along with our meals, as it's not included. It was cooked perfectly. Chili Paneer - 6/5 yep, that good!  It had a great chili sauce it was tossed in, and was crispy outside, with a creamy, cheesy middle. Yum!!!Murgh Tikka Trio - 4/5 every piece of chicken was spiced well and still juicy in the middle. I did find myself adding more sauce though. Samosa - 4/5 loved, but the cheese corn was not my fav.  I loved the potato the most and then the pea. They were all crispy, hot and good!Baingan Bharta - the eggplant dish I ordered - 5/5 so yum with a nice texture from the pop of the peas. I loved the flavor and this went well with the naan Chicken Saag - 5/5 great flavors, tender chicken. Madras - 5/5 we ordered the lamb for this one...it was my favorite. It was creamy and loaded with flavor. Loved to dip my naan in the sauce too!!!Chicken Tikka Marasala - 5/5 this was the spiciest of our dishes with an amazing flavor*I also wished they offered something complimentary, such as naan with a full meal or even the rice with a big order such as ours.  I hate when places make you order every piece of the meal to make it a meal. Overall: I do realize, they are brand new and still working on their groove, so I'm definitely willing to come back in a month or so, and hope they got it all together, so I can bump to a 5. Because the food is already there!!!!!Come try it out!  It's delicious!!!It won't take a psychic to see more Indian dinners in my future now that there's a quality spot around these parts.I was sold on Lamb Rogan Josh within seconds of perusing the menu.  The boneless pieces of braised lamb in thick, rich curry hit the inside "spot" that only Indian cuisine can.  The slow cooked tenderness of the meat was ideal and required minimal work with a knife.  Hearty and comforting, it was like wearing a mental snuggie.My wife got the Saag Paneer and enjoyed every bit of its pureed spinach glory.  Their homemade cheese was a bit different than any other we've tried as it was softer, more like buffalo mozzarella, yet it still retained some of that signature firmness that made it undeniably paneer.  Maybe their secret is milk with a higher fat content?  We ordered this dish "hot" which wasn't over the top spicy, but a nice smooth burn from start to finish.   The $6 vegetable sides were great to see as well.  Many places don't offer a half portion, so if I really wanted Chana Masala, my only choice would be to order an extra entrée.  We went with the Baingan Bharta, basically an eggplant mash which was a nice change up from the other plates.  I also liked that the bowls of rice that accompanied each dish were of generous portions unlike their only nearby competitor a few miles south, which only offer rice in a kid size.I am curious to see if they stick with entrees for lunch or cave with the rest of the in crowd and go buffet.  That won't deter me from going back during those hours though.  Can't wait to try more!Flavors are on point here at Curry Leaf. No buffet, just a la carte entrees, apps, sides, and desserts. I stuck to some fairly safe favorite dishes and found them all to be of great quality with deep, complex flavors. Ambiance is going for an upscale feel but pricing is reasonable.SAAG PANEER: Pure vegetarian Indian comfort, with unusually creamy and plentiful paneer. Pairs fabulously with the garlic naan (which was deliciously fragrant and beautifully blistered), this is my preferred meal.ROGAN JOSH: BF's pick, ordered medium, with a spicy and flavorful sauce. Lamb was in large, plentiful chunks but could have been more tender. Both main dishes included rice.BAINGAN BHARTA: Side of tandoori-smoked eggplant mash was contender for my favorite dish, with great smoky flavor and good texture. A bargain at $6/side.KULFI TRIO: We couldn't resist dessert, and the house-made ice creams fulfilled out sweets craving with a bright mango flavor, sweet raspberry, and nutty pistachio. Couldn't pick a favorite as they were all good, with great creamy consistency. Interior is upscale with modern (but slightly uncomfortable) chairs and a large bar area (but no alcohol license?), makes for an intimate date-night dinner spot. Unclear whether they plan to expand seating into the adjacent patio area. Service was attentive and polite throughout. This is one of those places I would come back and get the exact same meal, rather than trying more on the menu. They do the classic dishes extremely well and the portions were generous. Great option for a vegetarian meal.I have had a lot of Indian food in my life. I love Indian food. This is hands down the best Indian food I have had and not only in Vegas, not only in the US - but in my life.Came here with my boyfriend to try something new and saw good reviews on here. Unfortunately I have Celiac so can't have any gluten. We called ahead and asked, the dude on the phone said no gluten - no problem. So we went.And we are both blown away.After letting the (super sweet and attentive) waiter know I'm gluten free, we started with the chili paneer. When it came out we noticed it was breaded so I got scared for a second; then out of the blue the Chef and owner Ritesh comes to the table, introduces himself and says 'Don't worry about the breading, I used rice and chickpea flour for you so it would be gluten free.' WOW! Such dedication to great service.The chili paneer was absolutely unbelievable and so were our entrees (Chicken Tikka Marsala, Paneer Vindaloo, and sides of yellow Dal and eggplant).We will definitely be back and I cannot recommend this place enough. Whether you're gluten free or not, the food here is so fantastic and the staff and owner are so amazing that you're missing out if you don't give it a try!!After reading my friend, Philip T.'s review, I knew I had to come here and I'm so glad I did.  I got here at 12:15.  The restaurant is a pleasant place with lots of thought put into the interior design.I was seated promptly and given the lunch and wine menus.  I was brought water immediately and I looked at the menu although I had quite thoroughly studied the lunch offerings.  Their lunch menu is small but there are some very good choices.My server came to take my order and I got the lamb Rogan josh.  When asked if I wanted it hot, medium, or mild for spiciness, I questioned how hot their hot was.  (I know, stupid question!)  When Navi, my server, explained that it was hot I opted to go with medium but he offered another choice--medium to hot.  That was it.  (BTW, next time I'll get the hot.  This was spicy but it doesn't hit high on my spiciness meter.  I was given a choice of plain, butter, or garlic naan and I went with the garlic.After taking some photos of the restaurant, the food arrived and I was ready to dig in.  The lamb Rogan josh, a Kashmiri dish, was perfect!  There was a nice degree of spiciness to compliment the fennel, ginger, onion, and Kashmiri spice sauce.  The lamb was nicely tender.  The garlic naan was one of the few I've gotten where I've tasted much garlic.  Tearing pieces of naan and grabbing rice and sauce with my fingers, I was enjoying lunch to the max.While eating, Navi asked me if I was a photographer and I explained reviewing for Yelp.  In a short time, the chef/owner came out to greet me and ask me how I found out about the restaurant and how I liked the food.  We chatted for a bit and I noticed on his chef's jacket, there were both Curry Leaf Flavors of India and Saffron Flavors of India.  It turns out he cooked at Saffron for a couple of years for his brother-in-law and now has opened his own place.  He went to another table and then returned to the kitchen.  A very pleasant, welcoming man!When finished, Navi asked about dessert.  I didn't want rice pudding and my experiences with gulab jamun in the past have been mixed.  But, I opted for the gulab jamun.  Navi asked if I wanted it hot or cool.  I don't think I've ever had it any way but somewhat cool so I went with hot.  What a great choice!!  The saffron, cardamom syrup on the fried milk cakes was excellent.  There was sweetness but it was just right.  There were also small pieces of slivered almond which I haven't seen before.I was there for about an hour.  That's not indicative of slowness with the kitchen.  Wait time was short, but I wanted to savor the lamb and its sauce to the maximum so I didn't hurry with my lunch.  Others left the restaurant during this time and weren't replaced with new customers.  I'm wondering if they can make it without a lunch buffet.  The price is more than Indian buffets near UNLV.  The nice thing for me is that it's so close to home.I took a photo of their large patio.  I forgot to ask if they would have tables there when it's cooler but it would make a nice place to eat out when the 100 degree weather leaves.  And before I left, I took one of their menus so I can order take out next week.  I'm so glad they're here!For starters, we were quite impressed with the decor, a mixture of traditional and modern.  Great lighting, too. It has a large patio, not quite set up yet, but it was way too hot to eat outside anyway.  I asked about a wine list, and our waiter, Navi, brought over a single page that had two whites and four reds (along with a few beers).  I'm a white wine drinker, but can't handle either of the two, Chardonnay and Pinot Grigio.  They honestly get me sick.  He offered to go to the nearby liquor store and bring back anything I wanted.  I was going to skip the wine (horrors!), but the owner came out.  He explained that they were set to have a meeting this week with the wine rep, and they were working on setting up a full bar service, including more and different wines and specialty cocktails.  Though I posted a pic of the current list, I'm going to remove it.  I don't think it's fair to keep it, since the restaurant is new and still a work in progress.The owner, Ritesh, is a highly educated professional who switched to cooking as a second career.  We thoroughly enjoyed talking with him, and his desire to please radiated during our whole meal.  He insisted that Navi go get the wine I wanted, so I acquiesced. I was a happy camper.The menu is so atypical of the usual Indian restaurant.  It's very small, but everything is cooked fresh.  Ritesh explained that this allows him to focus on the quality of each dish.  He will, though, be adding a few other items, including a thali, which we love to order, since it allows you to sample a variety of food.We started with samosas, an order of three:  one with peas, another with potato, and the third with paneer and corn.  I don't think I've ever seen corn in an Indian restaurant before.  They were incredibly light, with pastry unlike the usual Chinese eggroll stuff you usually get, and the fillings were delicious, expecially the paneer and corn.  I'm not a pea lover, but loved the dense filling of that one.  The creamy mint and tangy tamarind sauces were yummy.For our mains we shared a Saag curry bowl, with chicken added, as well as paneer and fresh vegetables.  We ordered both of our dishes medium-spicy, and that's how it was.  Along with that we got Baingan barta, and the smaller size of smoked eggplant dish was a good accompaniment to the large portion of Saag. The garlic naan we ordered was covered with minced FRESH garlic. Last time we had it, at a different place, I couldn't even see or taste garlic.  As it was, I could barely eat much of the main courses after the filling Samosas, but then, I'm not a very big eater.  We'll have my very favorite meal - leftovers - tonight.As if the great food and phenomenal service weren't enough, a treat awaited us at the end.  Our wonderful waiter was nearby and heard me toast Herb for his birthday.  He said "Oh, is it your birthday?"  I told him it had actually been two days before.  But when we finished packing up the leftovers, Navi and Ritesh came out with a birthday dessert for us to share - their beautiful Kulfi trio:  mango, pistachio and raspberry, artfully presented on a long rectangular plate.Even better than the fact that it was a delicious meal, it was a special and memorable experience, and I wish Curry Leaf a long and prosperous life.Very excited to have this amazing Indian restaurant close to where I live, work, and play. The restaurant is simply beautiful, the food is top notch, and the service was excellent.We started with the garlic Naan bread and Baingan Bharta, which is Tandoori smoked eggplant that is mashed with various herbs. It comes in a small half size pot for half the price making it easy to combine with any entree. The flavors were extraordinary.This was followed by two curry entree's, each served with long grain white rice. We had the Chicken Tikka Masala and the Lamb Vindaloo at a medium spice level. The Tikka Masala has marinated chicken chunks with an onion-tomato tandoor sauce. The Vindaloo has a distinctive onion, garlic, red chili & vinegar sauce flavor. They were both mouth-watering!  - but, literally, the Vindaloo was slightly more spicy than the Tikka Masala due to the red chili's. Of course, the temperature is nothing for those that enjoy heaping spoonfuls of overpowering spiciness on a regular basis.I can't wait to try more items on the menu. The only downside: The restaurant has a "suggested" gratuity on the check that is between 15-20% of the grand total including tax. Gratuity should not be factored on top of sales tax; maybe the restaurant is hoping for the extremely generous types that likes tipping more than 20%.It's exactly a month since I was here the first time.  I came back for take out and I was delighted by the food.I called late in the afternoon for pick up after their dinner opening time.  I ordered the trio of samosas called Samosa Teen Tarike.  One was filled with green peas, one with potato, and one with paneer and corn.  The pastry was light and fried perfectly and the fillings were very tasty.  I really didn't need the sauces that were packed with them--a mint sauce and a tamarind sauce.  Both were good.For mains, I ordered chicken tikka masala for my wife--spice level mild--and I got the Madras curry with chicken and spice level hot.  Both were well done and the sauces were mild and hot as we both wanted.  We got two containers of basmati rice with the curries.I got a double order of garlic naan and it was as good as the first time I was here.  The order was packed perfectly for the short ride home and everything was hot when I opened the containers.A word about service.  Navi took my payment and offered me a glass of water at the bar while I waited.  Mr. Patel, the owner, came out to speak with me as he had done when I was there before.  He is a very genial man and he lets his passion for his restaurant and the quality of the food he serves come out.  We chatted a bit about the patio being opened soon as the weather is cooling. I'll be returning often.  Again, I say I'm glad they're a short drive from home and I'll be back.5 Stars for Delicious & Authentic Indian Cuisine!5 Stars for Friendly & Exceptional Service!5 Stars for Beautiful Ambience!5 Stars for Impeccable Cleanliness!5 Stars for Opening 3 Months Ago in an area of town that lacked an amazing Indian restaurant.Located in the SW part of the Valley, on Ft.

Came here for the second time ever the other day and the adorable waitress with tattoos and long, pretty hair walked up to me with a sweet smile and confirmed that I wanted a margarita on the rocks.  I was in utter disbelief that she remembered my drink order from the one other time I'd been in, a couple of weeks prior, but I guess somehow she did.  Plus the margarita was delicious, and perfectly mixed.  Very impressive service!

Hey come on now, Smashburger isn't THAT bad.At least, this one was better than the one I had in Irvine. Ugh. It's true though, first impressions are important. And for the one in Irvine in Socal, that one made me just be like wtf is this. But in the Forum Food Court in Caesar's Palace, I decided that I try Smashburger. Looking back, I should have tried Earl of Sammiches or something else not accessible/not eaten by me, but it was late, I needed dinner at 9.30pm, and this was the first thing I saw in the food court.First off, really nice service. I was greeted by the cashier and asked how my day was. Heck, most of the places today, you aren't asked that, and as a visitor to a city, you get to enjoy that more to explain that you're from out of town and that you're all giddy with your Fat Tuesday cup that you got from just down the Forum Shops and that you're now hungers. I got the original, which didn't look cold, which actually looked palatable, didn't have a lot of oil, didn't look like a menace. It looked edible. A plus. It tasted decently enough like a burger would be, but you know it's fast food, not the gourmet burgers that you get.It came out FAST. It took within a MINUTE from ordering to getting it to actually get the burger. I don't know what to say about that tho xDPrices seemed higher for some odd reason, ($7-8), which seems kinda high for a burger.. Hmmm.

Don't do it. Just don't. Tiny crabs, looked like sand crabs, or maybe and STD left unchecked way to long. My fingers hurt from trying to eat them. My tummy is rumbling... we'll just have to see how tomorrow goes, but I may be ill. Dry, dry cake. It's all just like pieces of a bad dream. Just use your better judgment and never eat here. No matter how drunk you are. If you can't resist a good time of awful overpriced food, head over to the Seigal Suites and give yourself a little punishment.If you really hate yourself, order the crab. Hey, it was an experience, that's for sure.Even though I would not classify the service as good, the waitress was a very nice person. (Is that what you say right before you break up with someone?)Enjoy!

Restaurant name  Super Burrito

Review Text :
So I see a new spot at the end of the strip called super burrito... Let's just say that I am SUPER disappointed!!!!! Let's start from the time I walked in there were two people flirting with each other, I then started to ask about prices to which the female didn't know.  She began to take my order and then all of a sudden was interrupted by a  kiddie shoving match flirting session again while I stood there and waited  to complete my order. So I ended up paying $9.04 on top of the $0.45 debit card charge whatever no biggie. I was excited because when you go to Baja they give you a full plate. But when I look at my to-go plate which was not even a full size to go plate it was not even full it was a little over half full. I reached out to the cook and asked him is this all I get for over $9. He said yes.  I asked for a little more, he said "no". I informed him that this was disappointing and that I would not come back. He responded with "that's fine" in Spanish.  I was shocked at the response so I informed him I will now leave a review about this place. Again responding with "that's fine". At that time I requested my money back.  it usually takes a lot for me to write a negative review but this place was horrible unprofessional/ portions were small/ employees don't know their own product and they are too busy horsing around and flirting. I will never be back and will make sure I spread the word.

Restaurant name  Duck Donuts
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
There was a lot of anticipation waiting for this place to open. Everyone loves a good gourmet donut and the Charlotte scene has been seriously lacking them. It is located in that little pocket of shops between Kenilworth and the East Blvd Harris Teeter (behind Menchies)Duck Donuts is a little more simplistic than I was expecting.You have one type of base donut.  You then choose the type of icing you want. Off the top of my head, there were about 8-10 choices. I chose one with Orange icing and one with maple icing.  Next you chose a topping to go on each donut. I think there were only five options here. I went with chocolate sprinkles on my orange iced donut and bacon on my maple iced donut. They also had coconut, peanuts and regular sprinkles.There are about 40-50 different combinations you can make between icing and toppings. The ones I had were pretty delicious. They also came out fresh. My donuts were still hot when I got home with them five minutes later.Ultimately I was not blown away to the point of now having to fight the urge to return, but they were very good and a great new place to grab breakfast. I'll be back for sure but think I can limit this to a once a month place instead of a once a week need.Doughnuts are certainly a treat to be held (and eaten) on specifically special occasions. Or, in the case of Duck Donuts, any time the urge befalls your day. Having good, nay, fantastic doughnuts in the hood is something that is somewhat of a foreign concept to Charlotte, for the most part. You've got your larger brands with plenty of presence, but having a smaller company show up in good ol' Crown Town is a welcome sight. Now, doughnuts are not too difficult to make acceptable in most doughnut-eaters' eyes. Serve em warm, slathered with glaze, and not much else. You're on your merry way to a great day when hot doughnuts are thrown in the mix. Duck Donuts is doing it right. Though, their process is pretty unique from others. First of all, the menu is rather simple. Doughnuts, coffee, a few breakfast sandwiches, and a few other things here and there. You order your doughnuts from the counter by singles or by the dozen, they are prepared on-the-spot, and served at the other end of the counter. The apparatus that forms and fries the doughnuts is so rad. It's a automatic dispenser that drops the perfectly formed doughnuts into the oil and then moves them along a conveyor belt. It's unlike any other I've seen. They do happen to have two of these guys for when the lines get longer and they need to crank out more fried dough. Note: ALL of their doughnuts are of the same base. (Cake Doughnuts) I.e. Not a yeast-based recipe. They are actually rather light and possess a perfect amount of crunch on the exterior. Not super heavy and dense like some other cake doughnuts of the world.  So far, we've tried a handful --LemonCinnamon SugarGlazedPeanut ButterStrawberryBy far, the glazed wins every single time. It's just so perfect and easy. Eat them warm or after a few hours and they retain the same flavor and texture. I'm sure heating them in the oven wouldn't be a bad call either. Very impressed with these guys. Their varieties of doughnuts will certainly win over tons of local Dilworth eating talent and I'm sure we'll plan on many a visit in the near future. Welcome to the 'hood, Duck Donuts!A donut is a donut, is a cake, is a pancake. (A tribute to my favorite scene from Girl, Interrupted.)I successfully avoided donuts for 6 months, only to be taken down 2wks ago in one fell swoop during an intense 2 day event where unlimited free donuts were available. Returned to Charlotte and haven't slowed down. That 'famine-feast' thing I guess.So, Duck Donuts. Mentioned to the cheerful woman at the counter it was my first time. She gave me the run down (which of course I quietly already knew, being an informed yelper) and it was showtime. Despite the warnings of excessive oiliness from other reviews, ordered both a maple & a chocolate coconut. She spied my donut lust, so offered at no charge one that came out too small to sell. Hell f***ing yeah. Chose vanilla.While I awaited my order, dove in to the gift. Warm, moist, pleasing. The other two arrived, and the maple RULED. At one point, I felt like I was eating hot pancakes. Thick & cakey.I did observe something, which is more of a note to management than anything else. The card machine was down, so cardholders were asked to leave their card numbers for processing later. One particular patron was visibly uncomfortable with this arrangement but agreed. The nice woman at the counter did try to run the transaction several times, but the system remained stubborn. Thinking the woman was just buying 1 donut, I began to offer to pay, but she had a whole box and I only had $3 cash left. The woman even doubled back before she left and asked the clerk to ensure her card info would be destroyed. All I could think was "just give her the da*n donuts!". I mean, what, it would have set them back, what, $12??? Plus, the store was closing in 15min anyway. The woman was clearly concerned, and a man eventually came out from back, who seemed managerial. It would have been an enormous act of customer appreciation and bred tremendous brand loyalty to just give her the donuts at no charge, thank her for her patience, and apologize for the delay. After the 2.5 donuts I ate, did feel slightly nauseous. Only one next time.

Why didn't I order extra pancakes to take home for lunch??! I got the pumpkin pancake, half order, and they were amazing. Besides pumpkin spice, they used seasoned pumpkin seeds and a cream cheese butter spread for pure mouth watering delight. On all of their pancake options (of which there are about ten tantalizing varieties) you can opt to make them gluten free. Woo hoo!The style of the restaurant was bright and cheery. They packed many people on the patio and inside but somehow it didn't feel overcrowded. It was a delight just to be present in such an upbeat and buzzy type of place.Why the four stars? Our server was great- pleasant, confident, friendly, knowledgable but it took a really long time to get our bill and then get it processed at the end. That may not have been enough to take it from five to four stars but on top of it we had to move the bench slightly and discovered a full pancake on the ground. Not really their fault if they couldn't see it, but kind of gross to have it down there for the meal.Those last points are so minor that I would never hold it against them. I eagerly look forward to our next visit. I fully intend to dive into one of their egg Benedict specialties next time!

Review Text :
New Chinese spot- layout and menu indicate that they specialize in lunch specials and takeout, but food quality was better than your average mom-and-pop take on Panda Express. Food is fresh and the menu has more options than expected, including boba drinks and a $2 spam musubi, but dishes are of the more Americanized style that is all too easy to find elsewhere.Lunch specials are around $7, while dinner specials are $9, but I opted to try the lettuce wraps- available in chicken, shrimp, vegetable, or combination. I found it odd this dish was listed in the "Chef Specialties" section, but the $9 portion I received was enough for two meals- several lettuce leaves, more than enough filling, and a giant heap of rice, too.Note that though they highlight their takeout and low prices, but food is cooked to order and it can take a bit longer than you might expect. Consider calling ahead if you're in a hurry.

Review Text :
Yes, the name is funny. Steamie Weenie is a no frills just good old-fashioned hot dogs with all the tasty fixings! It's like a bun filled to the top with pure Americana!Must orders, The Tucson and the Nor'Wester. The Tucson is a bacon-wrapped dog with pinto beans, tomato, diced onions, tomatillo lime salsa, yellow mustard, and mayonnaise. Yeah, it was mess and it was delicious. The layers of flavor were fantastic, the perfect mix of spicy, salty, citric amazingness.  You like a da spicy? You're going to love da Nor'Wester! This... cream cheese, griddled onions, scallions, fresh jalapeño peppers, and Sriracha. It's has a kick trust me, I was sweating while enjoying this bad boy. Tater Tot lover? Order the fully loaded tots and you'll be a happy camper. Tots, bacon, and cheese, you're welcome. My only beef SW are the buns. I'd like a sturdier bun, they tend to fall apart when you're only halfway done eating your weenie. Also, how about buns that match the dog? Order a Nor'Westrer, get it on a jalapeno and cheese bun or an "everything" bun for the Everything Bagel Dog? Just a weenie thought for great weenie spot.Gourmet hotdogs are a trend many people would like to see die already. Lucky for this spot, I am not one of those people. The weird name, cute logo, low prices, and a wide variety of menu offerings make this place a hot-diggity darn good spot. Follow them on social media to find out about their off-menu specials, such as the Run, Run, Rudolph dog for December: reindeer sausage topped with caramelized onions and sriracha cream. Simple but super tasty, it took a lot of effort to share this with my guy.Solid menu standbys include the Everything Bagel dog (w/cream cheese and scallions) and the Japanese-inspired Mt. Fuji dog (teriyaki onions, nori, carrots, scallions, wasabi mayo). Don't even get me started on side options (tot-chos, anyone?!).Location is cozy, service is genuinely friendly, and they even have a condiment bar to doctor up your dog with extra hot sauces and mustards. Don't forget about their house fry sauce and beer cheese!

Review Text :
Probably more like 3-point something stars based on two visits for the lunch buffet (they just opened a few weeks ago).  However, I'll round it up to 4 stars based on the fact that they actually have some appropriately SPICY food available at the buffet (there's plenty of non-spicy as well-- chicken tikka masala, palak paner, etc), and because both times I've been there both the main selections as well as the desserts have had things that you don't see at all of the  other Indian buffets nearby. At this point I'd probably compare Kangchen favorably against Dhaba and Swagat, and a step up from Maharaja and Minerva (all about a 5 minute drive from this place, so there's pretty stiff competition nearby!)

Restaurant name  The Rice Shop
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
Formerly a dismal-at-best fried rice counter, The Rice Shop is a serious upgrade and a welcome new business in this up-and-coming plaza! Rice bowls sound so simple, but they're comforting, fresh, and hit just the right spot when done well.Menu has about five different bowls, each with their own protein and complementary sauces, all with rice and veggies. The Mochiko Chicken Bowl is the only one I've tried so far and it was great- generous portion of fresh, juicy chicken with a great sauce, crisp veggies, and a scoop of rice. So long as you go in knowing it's mochiko influenced and not some strictly-authentic version of the dish, you should enjoy it. There are a few sides available, one being a salad with a choice of three house-made dressings (black sesame vin was my favorite.) Owner and Chef Tony is a treasure- I accidentally came just after close, but he opened up, let me in, and made my tasty dinner. He's charming and chatty and has some great plans for this place. I'll be coming back to try their Shrimp Bayou and porkbelly bowls soon!

Review Text :
EDIT: It appears that the restaurant owners (or somebody else affiliated with the business) have taken to writing fake shill reviews in a pathetic attempt to manipulate their overall rating. Notice that all of the 5-star reviews are by users with only 1 or 2 reviews. They probably gave one another most of their useful/funny/cool votes. In fact, Gabrielle Y.'s original review was removed by the Yelp admin, but a new one was posted IMMEDIATELY (literally within a few minutes). I urge my fellow Yelpers to read everything carefully and decide for yourself which ones to trust.My original review is below:--Wow, I haven't been this disappointed in a long time. My fiancée and I had been excited about coming here since we first saw the signage outside last month, and we finally came today (a Saturday), around 11:30 AM. The first thing we noticed is how disorganized the place is; they were busy training a new employee and none of the others was dealing with the line of customers waiting to order. The place wasn't super busy, maybe a dozen people eating and 4 others in line ahead of us.The way this place works: ingredients are separated into meats (which include fish, shrimp, etc.), vegetables, and "mixed meats" (fish balls and quail eggs). You tell them which ingredients you want, they put them all in a bowl, and cook in a soup with your broth of choice. Meats are $2 each, vegetables $1, mixed meats $1.50. While the concept is fine, the poor organization here means ordering is very inefficient. The staff are Chinese and so are we, but they didn't know the names of several items we asked for. I imagine it would be even more confusing for English speakers. They don't have a large quantity of the ingredients on the counter, so they are constantly running out of things and running to replace with a new batch. They also failed to keep track of what ingredients we ordered, and we had to help them add it up. All in all, ordering was a messy ordeal and I don't want to imagine how they handle the crowds during busier times. Personally, I think they should let customers fill their own bowl and pay by weight (like most similar places in China), or a fixed price per bowl (like the Mongolian grill type places in America). By charging different prices for different ingredients they may be squeezing out better profit margins, but at the cost of poor operating efficiency. I also think they should call your number and have you pick up your order at the counter, rather than trying to bring it to your table, which they can't find and end up constantly calling out numbers anyways. At the very least, they should let customers get their own chopsticks, napkins, and cups of water - it's yet another extra burden on the already disorganized staff. We asked for "slightly spicy" broth but what we got lit our mouths on fire. I don't know if they misheard or just don't have anything less spicy, but keep that in mind. They don't give you white rice, so make sure you order enough for the soup. My tongue was completely numb so I can't comment much about how the food tastes. But my fiancée had stomach cramps during the drive back home, and ended up getting sick. Overall, it seems that the owners didn't do sufficient preparation before opening the restaurant. They should have had the staff properly trained and rethought their operation procedures. As of right now, the place is a complete mess, which is a bad sign for a place that just opened and should have had things planned out. I won't come back because of the food poisoning, but in any case I would urge them to consider adopting the self-serve model of several other nearby eateries (Spoon House, Sushi Ichiban, etc.). It would significantly speed things up while not adding to their costs.--To summarize, I have to agree with the person who wrote the first review. I saw their ads a few months ago and was very excited. My husband and I gave it a try two days ago, and I have to say that I'm very disappointed about the food they offered. First, what you may want to know: I came from Sichuan, China where Chinese style spicy hot pot was originated from. What this restaurant's supposed to offer, spicy tang, is basically a fast food version of hot pot: you ordered food and they'd cook it for you. The most important factors for a good spicy tang are (1) plenty of choices of the food you can choose, and (2) the food has to be fresh and cooked just about right so it remains crunchy.Unfortunately, what this restaurant actually offers is none. Their choices of food are few and are frozen food that you can easily find at a Chinese/Korean grocery store. They don't offer potato slices, seaweed, or sweet potato noodles, which are considered must-haves in spicy tangs and they not hard to be found in Asian grocery stores. Their lotus root slices are basically frozen ones and taste horrible; they don't even bother to buy fresh lotus roots and cut them by themselves. To be honest, I think everyone can cook the exact food by themselves using the ingredient they can easily find in Asian grocery stores and don't need to spend $15+ at this place.I would suggest the owner to be more serious about opening a restaurant business. At least prepare fresh food and don't just buy frozen ones from super market. Also, I'm not sure whether the owner is aware of this, but the hot pot ingredients brought in Asian stores may contains pork or cow fat. I'd suggest you clearly mark it so that vegetarians or people with religious beliefs won't accidentally ate it.Food taste= spicy only with no other flavorsFood amount= e.g for two dollars, you are getting only three pieces of frozen sliced beef. No rice provided Food diversity= very limited. Food quality= not sure if the food was fresh or cooked appropriately, but my stomach was not happy after the mealService= unorganized, not just a little bitI noticed that there are three positive reviews came out the same day same hour, and I think as a true customer, I should write a real review here to let people know. I hope the owner of Spicy Tang will take care of their business more seriously!

New to the Centennial area and near to my house for food intake. We went late last night and sat at the bar. Bartenders were great and helpful. Service was fast and the food was good. The only reason I wouldn't go more often is because of the music. It's all country. And yes, I really do not like the newer style country that much. Enough for it to hinder me from eating at a particular location. The food was good. Not my favorite, but it was good. And it's awesome that this place is open until 2am. Centennial doesn't have a ton of late night options. La food:Their rolls. Good god alive, the rolls are amazing. Blue Cheese Wedge - yummy blue cheese dressing with crispy onions and cherry tomatoes. Stuffed Mushrooms - very good. The only thing is I wish they would put more crab and less mayonnaise. Prime Rib - Pretty good. Rare as it comes as requested. The sauce and the horseradish was tasty.Filet Oscar - Merh. This was my least favorite. The filet was good, but the asparagus was not and the bearnaise sauce wasn't tasty either. I ordered the white cheese mashed potatoes with my meal. And they were not good. Not creamy, dry and had no taste. The bartender told us that they had a really rough opening and the cooks were not really prepared. So maybe that's why the food isn't the best. I'm willing to wait a couple of months and go again.I've been waiting to try this restaurant for a while now and have been really looking forward to it. Called for Thursday 6pm reservations, was told they have a "wait list" they can add me to, but don't take reservations? Odd, but ok. I immediately received a text saying we've been added. Cool stuff. We arrived and had about a 5 minute wait for out table. The restaurant has a great vibe, nice decorations and you can smell the wood fires. Really liking this place! Soon after we sat, we realized this place has serious issues. We sat for at least 10 minutes before anyone came to bring water, ask for drinks etc. I saw several servers running like headless chickens. I also saw what I think were 1 perhaps 2 managers strolling around doing nothing like they didn't have a worry in the world. The menu is great, lots of great choices.  I really wanted to try several items.We ordered finally and got a pan of great bread dropped on the table. Waited another 5 minutes and finally called someone over so we could get silverware and napkins.  At least something to spread butter with. Things aren't looking good.Our waiter came finally and took our order. We then sat there for 35 minutes before seeing him again before our dinners arrived. Now we're so agitated it doesn't matter if the food is great or not. We've been here going on an hour still waiting...on a Thursday! Got our dinners, finished them, waited another 10 minutes, bussed our own dishes, asked for the check and left. Won't even comment on food as the entire experience was ruined by the total lack of service in what is hoping to be a mid-to high end steak house.Just so disappointed in this place, we really need more choices in the N.W. but Fire Rock will not be around long unless they get their act together.It might just be me, but when you step into FireRock, it feels like you're literally walking into the one and only Shenanigans. This place has the cookie cutter chain restaurant feeling down to a science. From the cheesy decor trying to look like an upscale steakhouse, to the terrible service from waiters who obviously don't want to be there, and the mediocre and overpriced food, it's like you're on the set of a movie...We sat down here for dinner this past Sunday night at around 5:30. With it being fairly new to an area with otherwise almost no good restaurants, I thought it would be much busier than it was. After all was said and done, I could see why it wasn't. Honestly, it's surprising to me that people would come here more than once, but I guess that's what keeps all these chain restaurants alive and kicking.When it comes to the menu here, it looks small at first, but has a whole bunch of options. I just really don't get those options. FireRock Steakhouse is supposed to specialize in steaks (it's in their name), yet they only have a few cuts of meats...with the rest of the menu having everything from street tacos to a monte cristo. Maybe the concept is just over my head, but their menu literally has about a quarter of a page featuring steaks, and that's it.Because it is a steakhouse, of course I wanted to try their steak. I ended up deciding on the Cajun-Spiced Ribeye, which for whatever reason is $2 more than their regular ribeye. The only difference it it's supposed to have cajun spices, which I think to them only means cayenne and paprika, and then some "Creole Butter". I'm almost positive they just use the exact stuff sold in a jar that goes by that name, and that's where they are getting the $2 up-charge from. You might have guessed it by now, but this steak was nowhere near worth it's $26 price tag. I requested it medium-rare and it was overcooked. Very little marbling in the meat, not much fat or flavor, and a really thin cut. You can see from my picture that there was virtually no juice from the meat on the plate, and it stayed that way even after being cut into. Any juicy was likely from the jarred Creole Butter anyway.What made FireRock even worse is the service. I realize they are still pretty new, but they've been open almost 2 months now. You'd think they'd have a good amount of the kinks worked out, but that just isn't the case. Our waiter looked like he was in hell, and every time he'd fill a drink cup, he'd slam the cup on the table like he was taking out his aggression on my poor iced tea. I'd say thank you, he'd walk away without saying a word. We had to ask for things more than once, and just to get some bread took 10 minutes. He just didn't really seem to care to be there at all.And while maybe not directly his fault, our salads took almost 30 minutes to come out, with our main entrees taking just over an hour. With our small party of 6, and the restaurant pretty slow overall, it shouldn't have taken nearly that long. To add fuel to the fire, my wife ordered a filet cooked medium, yet it came out much closer to medium-rare and was basically cold to the touch.As I said, I'm not sure what FireRock is going for. A menu that's all over the place with crap service and mediocre, overpriced food is a recipe for disaster. The good thing they have going for them is they are maybe 1/2 a step-up from an Outback, and are surrounded by other crappy restaurants. For people who constantly frequent mediocre chain restaurants, this might be a welcome addition...for everyone else, methinks not. "Eat somewhere else, enjoy your food".I wanted to give a good review, I'm sorry I can't. When we walked in the door, we were instantly confused. The atmosphere is of a high end steakhouse, but there are enough loud tv's to be a sports bar. With all the sports bars and sports books here, no one would come here to watch a game... and they kill the steakhouse feel. When we went to the bar while waiting on our table. The service was slowww. The bartender ignored us. We were helped by the service-tender, between him filling orders for the waitresses.Our booth was nice and comfortable for 4 people, but the table was small.  The salads were good, but slow arriving. So, of course, the meal arrived way too soon. I HATE THAT. So do you forget the salad and start eating the hot food, or finish the salad and eat a cold steak? Or send the food back to sit under a heatlamp? And remember the small table?!!!!!!Person #1- the pasta was boring.Person #2- the burger and mushrooms were overlooked.Person #3- the steak was flavorless and tasted microwaved.Person #4 (me)- the bacon filet was small. Cut several times on the edge (obviously checking for done-ness). Dry and rubbery. And it looked smaller than it actually was because there was no garnish to fill the blank area of the large plate (O platter presentation).The waitress did come check on us several times, but NEVER prebused, even though I DID and used plates were stacked! Did I mention the small table?My friend ordered a vodka martini at the bar, very nice presentation. When he ordered his second at the table, it was a shot of vodka in a cocktail glass with his olives carried separately in her other hand. Well, we were all so overit by this point, he just poured the shot in his empty martini glass and tossed in the olives.When we want a high-end lounge, we will go elsewhere....When we want a steakhouse, we will go elsewhere...When we want a sportsbar, we will go elsewhere...I generally don't care to haggle over service issues in a  dining establishment but when I do its usually with someone who is a very poor excuse for a F and B manager! Party of 6 walks in- place is swamped and very understaffed its very noticeable when your seated waiting 30 minutes to give a drink order.. Great! Order for drinks is in and we even get an appetizer ordered! 15 minutes for drinks to come to table and then 40 minutes for a spin dip That you've asked about twice since receiving drinks... Now nobody comes back for 45 minutes to take food order or give drink refills.. When the order comes out its wrong and we don't complain because who wants to wait for an additional 45 minutes to eat dinner. The topper.. sandwich comes out served with no bread because cook dropped the pizza bread on ground and now there's no more to offer... total joke was that when the manager comes to the table he has no idea how to deal with 6 aggrivated patrons. Get a real manager who knows how to schedule servers! Sad this is a nice place the NWest  needs this place and it's horrible. 3 times we've visited and each time the service was worse than the last. They need a rescue for sure.. We aren't in WY. We are in Las Vegas and we know what service is!!! Total dining time 4 hours! On a six top the corp should have had 2.5 tabkes in and out.. Fair warning local patrons!! I don't care how yummy the food was one time- poor management is a deal breaker..Today was the first and last time my husband and I will go here. The food was pretty good when my husband and I finally got it. (That's the only reason why they got 2 stars) We waited over an hour and 15 mins to get our meal. Sad to say their colossal potato wasn't "colossal"as they claimed. The waitress apologized for the wait and there was a mix up in the back. She said that the meal would be comped and a Manager would come over to check on us. We almost walked out just before the waitress came by to tell us about the mix up, but because the meal was being cooked and was being comped we hesitantly stayed. We did not complain or make a stink, because we understand things happen. Then we got our food, the Manager stopped by and wanted to see if there was anything else he could get us. Thinking that we already have the meal comped we didn't want to take advantage of the generosity and told him that there was nothing else we wanted or needed. Then we get the bill and it was not comped like the waitress stated earlier. Instead they took $14 off the bill. We will not be back. And I would suggest that they not lie to their customers.Came here last night for some late dinner and to try out the food again. We like to sit at the bar and we had the same bartender as last time. He is great. Super friendly, helpful and very on top of ordering the food and bringing it out. We ordered the sampler platter, salads and the Blue cheese burger. A lot of food...yes. The sampler platter was okay. I like the stuff mushrooms, but the rest was alright. The Blue cheese burger here is super good. The ONLY thing I would change is the bread. It's very spongeyish. I would like to have softer bread, but the patty itself is awesome. Happy to come back and try out some other stuff. But again - the music. Good god, it's horrible here. Last night, it was 80's...and not the good 80's music. Also, it was super cold. It had to be on like 65 degrees and we were freezing. I'm always cold and my boyfriend is always hot. And if he's cold, you know it's got to be freezing.

OK. I did NOT know this type of cafe existed in North America. My friend and I were looking for a place to get work done in Montreal when we stumbled across this cafe. With a giant cat symbol on the window, I thought it was only cat themed. But then I saw a live cat resting by the window, and that was the end of my search for a cafe. Walking inside, it was perfect. The large tables for work, free Wifi, cute ambience, availability of food and snacks, and 4-5 cats, some kittens. Smitten with kittens. They have some little toys and stairs for these little critters as well as feeding time, where they let the guests give the cats some snacks. I have to say that I probably could have gotten more work done, but who cares when there are kittens around. They are really friendly, and where my cat would probably claw you to death for a belly rub, the ones here are decidedly docile. As for the food, it's a vegan place, meaning you get a choice of soy or almond milk to go with your coffee. The coffee itself was OK. The flat white was excellent. The tempeh wrap was decent (I originally wanted the quiche, but they were out). The parfait and caprese sandwich were also great.It's a great and unique experience. 5-stars!

I wavered between 3 and 4 stars.  Here's why... Service and wait time were phenomenal- 5 stars, but our food ranged from 2-5 stars.I made a reservation on Open Table, and we were seated immediately in a nice elevated booth.  Our server arrived right behind the hostess to take our drink order.  The beer came out in a pretty awesome glass I dubbed a punch bowl and they had the clearest (uncloudy) iced tea I have ever seen.  Both were cold and delicious.  We started with fantastic salads that are large enough to share: WEDGE SALAD $9- Egg, tomatoes, bacon, candied pecans, bleu cheese crumbles and bleu cheese dressing.  Don't tell Fleming's but this is better than their wedge salad! CHOP SALAD $8-Romaine and iceberg, hearts of palm, artichoke hearts, bacon, avocado, tomatoes, jack cheese, chopped egg and garbanzo beans tossed in champagne vinaigrette.  Simply delicious.  Lots of different flavors in each bite.Entrees: PRIME RIB 12oz with garlic mashed $34-the garlic mashed was creamy and flavorful, but the prime rib was very cold when it arrived, fattier than we expected, and slightly overcooked.  They offered to reheat it and it was marginally better, but the flavor was just not that good.  I am not sure if it was a bad cut of meat or an off night, but I don't think it is something we'd order again to find out.PRIME DRY AGED FILET 8oz with a loaded baked potato $49- the filet was utterly fantastic; a buttery melt in your mouth bliss that I kept eating far after I should have stopped.  Sadly (or luckily since I was full), the potato was pointless.  It was bland and undercooked.  I also ordered a side of broccoli that looked amazing, but was also undercooked.  Very hard.  I wanted a dinner veggie; not crudités.Desserts: CHOCOLATE PEANUT BUTTER CAKE- Very rich, but very good.  The cake was moist and the whipped cream tasted homemade. We took 95% of this cake to go (sans ice cream) but we wanted to try it at the restaurant.APPLE PIE- Omg, I think they stole this recipe from my grandmother!  Devine crisp apples, cinnamon, and not overly sweet.  A winner for sure!Side note; like Fleming's, you can get a $100 gift card at Costco for $79.99.  Built in 20% savings.Lunch at Larsens was Lovely!Located at the Galleria Mall it's an easy find.  We stopped in on a weekend during lunch hours.  It wasnt too busy at all so we were greeted and seated immediately.   There is a very comfortable dining setting.  They have patio dining as well when the weather cools down.  Our waiter was awesome.  He was very professional and attentive.  He had a great understanding of the background of Larsens along with the menu.  I decided to try their stuffed chicken.  It was lightly breaded filled with artichokes, mushrooms, sundried tomatoes and cheese.   The portion size was enormous.  I think they used two large chicken breasts which provided enough for me to have two more leftover meals.  The ingredients gave it a wonderful flavor.  I was happy with the lighter breading as well.   The accompanying sides of mashed potatoes and asparagus were also good.  Again it was a large side of mashed potatoes that I easily shared.   We enjoyed a lovely meal and would be more than happy to come back.Lured over here by Bethany's review, I came for a date night with my guy and was pleasantly surprised to see this upscale steakhouse spot attached to the Galleria mall- complete with valet parking.FILET MIGNON SASHIMI: Surprisingly tasty and imaginative! I have no idea why this spot has sushi on their menu, but this dish bridges the sushi and steak offerings in a clever way with a seared presentation served on a mountain of wasabi potatoes. I enjoyed this way more than I thought I would.CHOP SALAD: Generous portion, easily sharable. Toppings include garbanzo beans, tomatoes, cheese, bacon (maple glazed and spiced with Cayenne?), and avocado. HERB CRUSTED ROASTED CHICKEN BREAST: Despite coming here based on a review for the stuffed chicken breast, I ended up opting for this version. The mushroom cream sauce is delicious, I just wish there was more of it. Portion is huge, given sides are wild rice and glazed carrots. I subbed the mac for the rice since that dish is rarely remarkable anywhere. The carrots were tasty but the glaze gets into every other component and adds an unnecessary maple sweetness to everything it touches. Maybe side these separately.FIVE CHEESE MACARONI: An indulgent baked version with penne pasta, ample creamy sauce included. I'm not generally a fan of baked macs because they tend to be dry, but this version was exceptional. NY STRIP STEAK: Because you gotta order at least one steak at a steak house. Got the wet-aged at the suggestion of our server, it was nicely crusted and cooked to a perfect medium-rare. Side of asparagus was tasty, sauce and other add-ons (bleu cheese, onions, mushrooms, etc.) are unnecessary. Meat was super tender and full of flavor.We were so full even with takeout boxes that we opted against dessert, but they have a large selection. They offer half-off wine by the bottle on Wednesdays, which we may have to come back to try. Note that they also have a selection of wine on tap! Service from Neil was attentive and knowledgeable, with plenty of suggestions- request him specifically.TIP: They have a "piano hour" (their version of HH) with app and drink specials on the patio, lounge, and bar area. Worth a shot for light bites.

There seems to be something missing. I was really excited about Amelies coming to South Charlotte. I am in a long, drawn out love affair with their salted caramel brownies - like everyone else in charlotte. The food is ok. I'm currently crunching on a turkey and brie sandwich... but it's just ok. Even the caramel brownie isn't out of this world like I have experienced at the other location. Just something off.This location is more open and easier to navigate. There's a place for a line to form, plenty of seating, and an outdoor patio where the Love Locks live. It's all nice, but there's nothing fancy or "hidden gem" about this place. This isnt the quiet study spot that i expected it to be, but maybe I'm comparing it too much to NoDa? The staff doesn't help much either. I've been here 3 or 4 times and every time I feel like I'm not hip enough - and Lord knows, it could just be me. Haha. When I order at the counter, I feel like I'm interrupting something, or not doing it right. There's not a whole lot of explanation - more "what do you want?". Nah mean?So, I'll continue eating my sandwich and floating on their wifi. I'm not in love with this location like I thought I would be. I think if I didn't know what to expect, and had never heard of Amelie's, it might bring in another star - but only for the unique decorating. It's fine, and I'll come here again for coffee... *womp womp*

I was told that I must go here by another amazing Yelper and boy was he right, this place is amazing! The tacos come plain and then you pack them with toppings from their fabulous salsa bar that has everything that you could ever want on your taco! The bar consists of a ton of salsas, hot sauces, jalapenos, cabbage, slaw, avocado sauce, homemade ranch, tartar sauce, cucumbers, pickles onions,  limes... seriously, you name it, it is there! I ordered their beer battered fish tacos and holy yum, I was in heaven! On Taco Tuesday, it is buy 2 tacos, get 1 free! ...Can't beat that! We may be regulars here very soon!

Review Text :
nah, son. we stopped here on the way to our hotel after our flight from NJ. My colleague said to just pick anything out i saw along the way. I somehow expected ANY Mexican place in Arizona to be good, kinda like in San Diego. Apparently I was wrong. I love carnitas. Our waiter raved about the carnitas there when I expressed my interest. dude was either full of caca or has never had good carnitas in his life. I've never had carnitas so dry before. this place is obviously about serving large portions for low prices - but the quality is lower than the prices. i wasn't even feeling the fried ice cream here. it's not easy to get me to talk negatively about dessert, yo.the Cadillac margarita was okay. and if it weren't for the Frida Kahlo art on the walls I would chalk this experience up as a total loss. Frida gets a star all her own.Oh, saw the end of the Giants/49ers game where the Giants won it in the last few minutes. that was good too.I've had the opportunity to dine at this location twice now.  Service has been quick, place is clean and it's a fairly comfortable Mexican restaurant.  So on the topic of Mexican... I get the Carlos, yet the Obriens.... not so much =).  The top 2 recommend dishes on both visits were the Pollo Fundido and the #13 A Little bit of Everything In Miniature!Sadly, I have had both and they were both just borderline OK for me.  Not much flavor (though decent serving sizes).  I do not understand why it's so hard to find good, especially authentic tasting Mexican food in Arizona?  Sorry C.O. just not a winner for me.  Best to you and the customers that are fans.I'd strongly suggest to spice things up.
Tia Rosa's Taqueria=Totally loved their small beef burrito. The enchilada and tacos are also good.  I couldn't even waste a single one of their homemade chips.  Come on ova to this busy joint, you won't be disappointed.
The Habit Burger Grill=Five stars for a fast food chain?  Yes!  Cleanliness, friendliness, speed, efficiency, and food quality were all on point.  This is the first of 12 Habit Burger Grill's coming to the Valley.  They were somewhat busy when we stopped by for lunch today, but the line moved swiftly and the girl who took our was very sweet and proficient.  We had our receipt, drink cups, and our pager in less than a minute. Off we went to get drinks (Coke products, 3 different brewed iced tea choices, and strawberry lemonade), condiments, and some jalapeños from their pepper bar before sitting at a comfortable booth.  Our pager went off within a few minutes and we got to enjoy our delicious hot and fresh charburgers, sweet potato fries, and onion rings.  The charburger was juicy with a great flame broiled taste, the bun was light and fluffy, and the lettuce & tomato were fresh and crisp.The orders of onion rings and sweet potato fries were both generous in portion size.  We could have shared one order, but how can you try both that way!  The onion rings had a great crunch and a tasty batter.  They provided ranch with our rings if you like to dip.  The sweet potato fries were very good as well.  They were on the softer side which I liked (not fried to a crisp so you can't even tell they are sweet potatoes).  Next time I want to try the Tempura Green Beans, because they looked really good too!  The salads and grilled chicken sandwich are also on my future visits list.Nothing special.  Fresh vegetables on a bun with hardly any meat. My advice. . . get the double. PROS:  Flame broiled             Strawberry lemonade (homemade)CONS:  Not enough meat on the burgerJust had a Charburger at the Habit Burger Grill. It blew my mind... Not the burger, though I wish it did. No, the fact that I went to UC Santa Barbara for college, lived in Goleta where the first Habit location was founded and today is my first time having one of their menu item! Did that Goleta location shut down while I was there?  I have no idea. What I do know is that the Charbrburger is just alright. Better quality and fresher ingredients compared to McDonald's, but the burger just didn't wow me. Maybe I needed that Fry Sauce I read about in other reviews.The Strawberry Limeade is good though. Very sweet, so I had to water it down, but I liked it better as a sugary drink over the Charburger vs say a Single with Cheese Animal Style.Suggestion: avoid the lunch crowd, especially during the summer and the outside temperature is in the low 100s, because that's where you will have to sit and eat if you can't fight for one of the coveted indoor seating spaces.Carpool if you can too, because Panera has crazy lunch crowds too and the parking lot is also shared with Chipotle, Jamba Juice & Pieology. The clear winner? The owner of this strip mall of course!"I feel it"-----------------------------------------­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­-----------------------Quick Review™*This rating and review is based on a series of firsthand experiences of patronising this restaurant located on Flamingo/Paradise.*For the purposes of contextualization of this review: I have never visited any other The Habit Burger Grill location. I was a Habit virgin.*Some items I have tried: Charburger, Double Charburger with Cheese, Veggie Burger, Chicken sandwich, Chicken Club, Sweet Potato Fries, Fries, Strawberry Shake, Strawberry Limeade. All good or better.Pro Tip: Strawberry shake is the best I have had at a fast food-casual. The music being played is also the best in terms of FF-C.-----------------------------------------­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­-----------------------Someone convinced me to try The Habit; I was at Coachella. I looked in at the location in Indio; however, the enormous crowds that congregated during April were just too long of a wait for fast food or fast casual or whatever the fuck this is considered. So, I never tried it until it debuted in Vegas. And even then: I was not in a rush. It was the No Kid Hungry® charity campaign that brought me in the doors and subsequently made me a fan. The food is solid for fast food/casual; the strawberry limeade might be the best drink I have ever had at any fast food/casual anywhere. Easily would go the proverbial distance in a bout against the strawberry limeade at Cafe Rio®. Only way to find out would be a double blind test. Pro Tip: Get the strawberry limeade. It's Best in Show™.-----------------------------------------­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­-----------------------Step 1: Place your order with the personable order-taker. Step 2: Take the buzzer and proceed to wait/wash your filthy hands since you just felt up a buzzer that has been touched by a hundred people who spend all day doing everything besides washing their hands.Step 3: Eat. Step 4: Refill your strawberry limeade before hitting the road.Pro Tip: Construction on Flamingo makes it cumbersome to get back on Paradise. Drive north on Hughes Circle until it leads to Paradise just south of Gordon Biersch. This could be helpful to UNLV or Hard Rock Hotel visitors. -----------------------------------------­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­-----------------------Rating: Five-stars, "Woohoo! As good as it gets!"
Harry's Bar & Grill=I'm going to save that elusive five star for a proper visit back, but Harry's earned a little Yelp love this week. I recently hosted a tasting with John Gilmour Butchers. As the bells and whistles of the evening were organized by someone else, I didn't have any say over the hosting venue.... which can be a bit nerve wracking when you're a little ocd event planner. When Harry's Bar & Grill was mentioned, I immediately took to Google and... proceeded to have a minor panic attack. My Google search brought up the former Harry's Bar and the reviews/photos were about as polar opposite as I'd want for a swanky steak event... I knew they had renovated, but really... how much different could it be?Very. Very freaking different. COMPLETELY different.Thank the event gods!I'm not sure if the staff noticed my audible sigh and not so subtle happy dance when I walked through the door but walking into this beautiful, contemporary room was like Christmas. The space is lovely, polished and a complete 180 from its former inhabitant. They have a great bar space, good outdoor seating and a swanky atmosphere, without being stuffy. Plus: they have wifi.*Happy Dance*So we settled into our evening, where the Harry's Bar team were in charge of grilling up the steaks for our table. No problem there, they happen to have a Josper oven. Read: fancy pants charcoal oven.*Happy Dance*Not to mention, really damn fine chips and a decent whisky selection behind the bar.*Happy Dance*It's also a ten minute walk from my house, is open at lunch... and did I mention the solid wifi?*Happy Happy Happy Dance*Needless to say, what I imagined might be a total train wreck of an evening, turned into one of my most pleasant event surprises. I should be more trusting... especially when steak and chips are involved.
Pancho's=I was soooooo looking forward to this place opening since being a SoCal native and been to the Manhattan Beach location! Beautiful interior nothing like it here in Las Vegas! I wanted to seriously love this place but $14.00 for plain nachos? Really? Hello? Wake up call- this is not SoCal and this is not Manhattan Beach! $18.00 for an enchilada? These prices are unrealistic even for Summerlin! This is Mexican Food! The cheapest food you can buy and make! I know you spent 3 million on the building and I can imagine your rent but with there prices I give you 6 months then Via Con Dios! Plenty of near by places cheaper with established service and food...lower your prices if you want to survive here in Las Vegas! I don't mind spending money on food but really? Expensive Mexican food is an oxy moron at this point!New place! New vibes! Familiar tastes...I've been watching this building come together for months so I was super excited to finally walk through the beautiful doors. When it comes to first impressions, it was love at first sight. A major wow factor! Whoever designed this place deserves 5 stars. They brought the beauty of Mexico to us in Vegas! It reminded me of the movie ~ Original Sin with Angelina Jolie. I do have one note about the design and that's the little room behind the beautiful staircase. I highly suggest that room is used for private parties & events only because customers don't get the true experience sitting there. We were guided over to it and I said no way, then we were sat in the lovely courtyard & I couldn't get enough of that space! Art, central fountain & greenery surrounded us and I loved it all. The service was fantastic & I'm even going to give a shoutout to Jason who took great care of us and was also very sweet & funny. The food was good, not amazing. I've definitely had better but everything also tasted better sitting in this space. We also only tried one thing but that's how it goes sometimes. We ordered the enchiladas de Langosta which were filled with lots of luscious lobster. Prices are high here but they definitely didn't gip us on the seafood. I also need to add that the portions are HUGE. We shared and couldn't even finish everything. The black beans lacked in flavor & were a tad undercooked. The green rice was perfect and the creamy chipotle sauce was super rich, a tad too rich for me. Overall it was good but not amazing. I needed bolder flavors but I'm still interested in going back & trying something else. The menu itself offered a lot of classics & a few unique dishes so it'll have something for everyone.This place gets two stars because the interior decor is gorgeous (for the most part) and the chips are nommy.  The waitstaff is good about filling beverages and chips. That's it.  You are paying for the decor and construction costs, and not getting quality or tasty food in return. I ate here last week for lunch, after being told there was a two hour wait on opening day (despite the restaurant not being full).  I was seated immediately this time, after the hostess rudely remarking that she remembered me from the previous week.  I was brought to a table near the base of the stairs... So far so good.  Although the water in the fountain was green and cloudy.I ordered a chicken chimi and iced tea. This was around 2:30 pm and it still took about 45 minutes for my food to come out.  By that time I'd eaten way too many chips (yeah they're good although the salsa is just meh) and wasn't very hungry.  Which is good because my chimi was the smallest burrito I've ever seen.  It was dry and lacking in flavor and I left half of it and the beans and rice (also meh) on my plate.  Definitely not impressed.I've had better food for a fifth of the price at Roberto's Taco Shop, and that's saying something, since I think Roberto's is also crap!Don't waste your money.  If it wasn't for the pleasant server ( who was taking care of way to many tables); I would give this place no stars. Believe the bad reviews and be suspicious of the positive ones.  Food lacks flavor or personality and is over priced. Service is excruciatingly slow.  I simply did not enjoy my meal and I am annoyed that I can never get the time back that I spent  waiting for my disappointing meal. I would rather eat at Chioplte or Cafe Rio. Mediocre food and abysmal service  at 4 star prices.Honest review about the place. First problem, seated next to the door of the kitchen. The people had to walk in between 2 customers chairs to get in and out. They shouldn't have table at that spot. Overall they need to remove some tables from the place period!! Not comfy seating environment. The manager dropped a dirty fork on my friend's shoulder and didn't even apologize. We asked for a move, which took another 20 minutes because the host forgot about us. Finally they moved us to another table. The manager came smoozed with us after but he never acknowledged the fork incident. The food is mediocre, I ordered a $25 menu item which should've of been $11.99 at most places. It's very overpriced, these prices work for Manhattan Beach , CA for their original location, not Vegas. The food is bland and uninspiring, especially when we have amazing Mexican food here like Lindo, La Mojarra Loca...etc etc. To diners who love food, this is a skip!
That BBQ Joint=I ended up at That BBQ Joint (TBJ) by happenstance after my efforts to visit the newly opened A-OK Coffee location on East Washington Avenue were foiled by my inability to find a parking space.  But my luck was not all bad that day as both the food and service at TBJ exceeded my expectations.  There is a definite black and white theme to the restaurant interior.  The interior walls have a fresh coat of institutional white paint, with black trim around the doors and windows.  The menus are written on whiteboards with black ink and the food comes on a black & white checkerboard patterned paper liner.  The large front windows allow for waves of natural light to stream into the interior and allow diners keep tabs on the action taking place on Willy Street.  While the building has seen better days, the new occupants have cleaned it up nicely.Since TBJ does not have waiter service, I had limited interaction with the staff.  Nonetheless, all the staff members I interacted with were courteous, polite and helpful.  As a first time visitor, my order taker offered helpful suggestions when I mentioned I was visiting for the first time.  He also checked in to see what I thought of my sandwich which doesn't always happen at counter service restaurants.  Throughout my time at TBJ, this employee was constantly tidying out the dining area and checking the condiment supply levels when there was a break in the somewhat steady flow of lunch time customers.I elected to go with the Thursday special, the TBJ Cubano sandwich (pulled pork, ham, mustard, pickles and a pressed, well-buttered French roll). Mad props to the kitchen for their fantastic griddle work on the French roll as every bite yielded a satisfying crunch.  The pulled pork component provided plenty of porky deliciousness.  The Achilles heel of the sandwich was the ocean of generic yellow mustard slathered onto the sandwich.  With a little better balance, this could be a top echelon sandwich in town with an amazing stable of sandwich offerings.Bonus content: TBJ sells bottles of their sauce for $8.After this positive first impression, a return visit to TBJ is certainly in my future.  The wonderful aroma of smoked meats wafting through the restaurant during my first visit has me eager to try there more traditional BBQ offerings of smoked brisket, ribs, pulled pork and smoked chicken.
Leo's Pizza=OK, this place is new. So we must give them time. Always want local businesses to succeed. We have been waiting for a while for Leo's Pizza to open up. Finally they are.We ordered the cheesy bread, and large pepperoni and jalapeno pizza with extra thin crust.Cheesy bread was great, comes out extra hot. Cheese is like it's name. Very cheesy and taste great. The marinara sauce is also very good.Pizza was OK, came out very hot. Smells great, truth be told, taste is not bad. However, bottom of crust is very crispy. But it gets soft on top of the crust. My guess they need to cook it slower and hotter. The ingredients were great. Sauce, cheese, pepperoni are good. Jalapeno was awesome, pickled perfect, and very spicy. Place really doesn't have a decor. Seats 48 people, but has four big screens. Has your basic tables and chairs. They do have about four beers on draft. A nice menu selection, and desert. Would we try this place again? Of course. I am hoping, it gets better as time goes on.
Zydeco Po-Boys=I love all the great new restaurants popping up in this part of town! Stopped in on opening day for a poboy and was pleasantly surprised by the modern-country interior. The colorful stick-on letters for the menu and signage felt a little cheap, wonder if they're still waiting on more permanent signage?In any case, service was polite and suggested the shrimp poboy or their daily special (today's was turkey, ham, and brisket)- all sides are extra and sandwiches range from about $10-13. Large sandwich easily feeds two, and the meats tasted fresh-cut, but the bread was ridiculously dry and falling apart. Wish I'd opted for the classic shrimp or debris version, as the special lacked any sort of Cajun sauce or Louisiana pizazz. Next time I'll have to add on a side of gumbo or Cajun fries. Sides are a bit pricey and sandwiches are huge, not a great place to fly solo.
Smoke Modern Barbeque=My wife and i joked about just what Modern BBQ could be?  Fusion or some other adulteration of southern BBQ?  We entered with trepidation.And we were wonderfully surprised to find a modern, almost nightclub ambiance, comfortable and easy on the eyes.  Hostess seated, we met a very fine Bahamian waiter, Sanfred.  In his soft accent he described the menu, answered our questions and returned shortly to take our order.The menu had the standard chicken, pulled port, ribs, beef brisket & sausage meats and then a nice selection of sandwiches, salads, appetizers and sides.  Good job and the descriptions were excellent.Iced tea was served in glasses and refilled via a fresh glass...rather than the splashing, ice filled pitchers more commonly found in other BBQ places.  And the unsweetened tea did not need sweeteners, well brewed and not bitter.We split a house salad which was huge.  Doubt is one could eat a whole salad and any other main since the salad was so plentiful.  Dressings were all house-made.  Excellent.Beef brisket, a favorite of ours and not easy to find outside of Texas, was excellent.  If you simply order brisket you will get fatty and lean slices, so specify your preference.  My wife asked for her two fatty slices to be traded for lean and this was accommodated easily.  I ordered a two meat combo of pulled pork and brisket and received a good portion of each.The pulled pork is without sauce, so you can first taste how savory that smoked meat tinted with burnt edges truly is.  Then add one of the four sauces on the table:  mustard, vinegar, KC sweet and KC spicy. The spicy was Goldilocks just right for both of us.Sides included excellent mac & cheese and creamed spinach, along with a cider slaw.  All three were excellent and served in their own small bowl.  We brought most of the two sides home as the portions were too much to eat given the salad and meats.Prices were a bit high, but the quality of the smoking, sides, menu options and generous portions validated the costs.  Our lunch for two was right at $50 and that was with iced tea, no booze.Nice experience and quality without the mob scene found in surrounding more casual BBQ joints.  Will try more items as time goes on, most likely resulting in a five-star rating.
Hiroba Sushi=It's true, it's true! all the previous reviews of 5 stars is not a joke this is SUSHI the way it's meant to be! Lana and I had lunch here today and we were very impressed with the service, the decor and especially the important part, the SUSHI!OMG! think back to your last sushi meal, do you remember anything that was really a stand out? How about something common as a spicy tuna roll, do you remember it or did you just consume it because you were hungry? Hiroba Sushi must be what it is like in the home of genuine sushi back in Japan. The menu is very extensive and there are no objectionable names describing the various items to dine on, if you know what I mean. Severs here rate up there with the best fine dining establishments in a 5 star resort. You can relax, enjoy some sake or beer and watch some sports on TV if you wish, but the shining star is Sushi!The menu had so many choices some your recognize and some that are new to us. We chose a few on our own and we got some ideas from previous Yelp reviews.What we ordered:The "Green Monster", delicious and that fresh, smooth avocado was perfect. You can taste every ingredient and the presentation is impressive. We ordered a second one in a matter of minutes!"Hamachi Crunch" was awesome! it was gone in no time. The Caribbean, Salmon Lovers and a common spicy tuna roll is the freshest and tastiest we ever had.Lana's big complaint in most sushi places is the temperature of the fish and here at Hiroba the fish is noticeably cold and FRESH. Who here has had nigiri sushi served at near room temperature? Well it just won't happen here. The serving temperature is prefect, you will notice the cool, fresh serving temperature in every bite and the fish has the essence of the sea. This was our first visit, but we know we will be back again and again, it's that good!Our server explained to us that even the iced green tea was freshly brewed and organic, it was served Thai Iced tea style with a side of cream if you preferred it served that way.Many years ago, this same location was called "Sushi Club" and it was the only place for sushi for us and for some unfortunate reason it closed down. Then it was recently a Italian and sub sandwich shop which also didn't make it. Well, good things come to those who wait and for the many sushi fans that keep wandering southern Nevada for the sushi of their dreams, this is it. Search no more, this place is TOPGUN sushi with a unique approach, it's fresh, tasty and very reasonably priced.Stop going to AYCE (All You Can Eat) feeling terrible as you stumble back to your car, Hiroba Sushi is the pinnacle of the art of Japanese sushi, like a big tuna caught on a line, we are HOOKED!Hiroba is another great non-AYCE sushi spot in the Anthem area. They have the total package: amazing food, superb customer service, and great prices.Honestly, I am not much of a "roll" person, but their rolls make me a believer. I normally steer free from rolls with cream cheese and excessive sauces; however, Hiroba does an excellent job of balancing flavors, while maintaining creativity at the same time. My absolute favorite roll here is the lemon roll. Other sushi places have failed to deliver this simple roll, but Hiroba hands down nails it! Something about that lemon-y ponzu sauce just puts it over the top for me. I love that they top this roll with both hamachi (yellowtail) and salmon. An interesting, yet intriguing roll is the crunchy tower (5 pieces). It is deep fried spicy salmon, avocado cream cheese fruit mix, crispy shallots, roasted nuts, drizzled with eel and mango sauce.   Seriously, don't knock it until you try it. It's different, but totally works. The green monster is on the roll menu, but is hardly a roll. The inner core is a mix of chopped soft shell crab, surimi crab, and yum yum scallops. All this is encapsulated by avocado and topped with crispy shallots. *Side note: the rolls here are flavorful on their own. I barely touched the soy sauce, wasabi, or ginger.*Honorable mention: snow white roll. Love the subtle smokiness of this roll and overall taste! They offer a full menu including: udon, yaki soba,  fried rice, donburi, entrees, and bento boxes. Everyone who works here have been so welcoming and friendly. Attentive service without hovering.  Most importantly, fish was fresh and of great quality!
Niu-Gu Noodle House=Are there guidelines to what ramen should and should not be?Niu-Gu is an outlier to what traditional ramen styles are, but would closely resemble to Tantan-men or Dandan noodles. The broth is clear like much of traditional Chinese/Vietnamese noodles, cleaner and not as heavy (better for the summertime, or when you're sick in bed and don't want to eat much). The lemon pepper broth sounds strange but its really similar to Northern Chinese noodles. The bowl is brought out on a cart and then a hand torch is used on the onions to give it a char flavor perhaps. Comes with a couple pieces of charred short rib slices that are soft, a little smokey, and melt in your mouth good.The Niu-Gu Rib items (short ribs and lamb) require you to call ahead of time, and seems to be a bit of a hassle to order and the regular lamb chop I believe has a 15-20 min wait time, so consider calling ahead if you're here for a quick meal!Niu-Gu is different than traditional ramen, and maybe some people would consider it fusion or a new style, but with so much resemblance to old school Chinese noodles, maybe its really the ORIGINAL style.
Bakn=Nice digs!  Nice waitstaff!Great bacon!Really good Bakn Bakn Bakn breakfast with some thinly sliced tasty potato home fries and toast.The menu is creative and has many items that do not have bacon.  Looking forward to returning and trying some other items.Found out they are open all day including dinner with the same menu.  A full bar with wine, beer and specialty drinks is available.  I did think the prices were a little high.Got Bakn!Love the Bacon! Two visits for dinner and was so pleased with the service and food.Laura was tremendous and fun on the night we had a group. We had to wait at the bar for about 20 minutes, but that was good too.We shared a couple of apps, Bakn flatbread and sausage stuffed banana peppers.  A good start to a good meal.  The slow braised short ribs came with a creamy parmesan polenta, much better then my own, applewood bakn and a sunny side egg.  The sauce is made by Chef Randy's mom, so good.On the other visit, the family went and enjoyed.  I had the Bakn Bley Burger with slaw.  The burger was cooked to temperature and very good.  The slaw was fresh and OK, I prefer a little tang to my slaw.
Miracle Mile Delicatessen=A free standing Miracle Mile- hell yes! Since the downfall of the locations I grew up with at Park Central, and ChrisTown Malls, the closing of the locations at both Arrowhead and what used to be The Colonade Mall (turned into some kind of strip mall place), I was thinking I would never again get to have a hot pastrami sandwich from a place that has been in my life since I moved to Phoenix at the age of 4 and that had been in my maternal families life since before then.We came on a Sunday around noon after we were at the cemetery for the unveiling of my Grandmother's headstone. It was had/has been an emotional time and going to a place that had an historical place in my memory and in our family seemed somewhat appropriate. The ONLY thing that was missing was the Karsha's rye bread (Karsha's closed) and the rye bread they are using isn't quite as tasty, with the right kind of pull. The pastrami was just like all of my memories. MM used to be a Jewish Deli and has been Jewish "Style" for years and years now. My husband loved his turkeyBLTA and his side knish and everyone else enjoyed what they had. Private parking lot- and perfectly planned thick covered door handle coverings so you don't burn your hands opening the door.Looking forward to coming back.
Max's Farm Table=My recent lunchtime visit to Max's Farm Table was a study in contrasts - the deficiencies of the front of house unfortunately detracted from the glimpses of greatness exhibited by the kitchen.  Factoring the unevenness of the food and that the limited menu is not well-configured for the lunch crowd, I plan to sit on the sidelines while the restaurant works out these kinks.I enjoyed the look and feel of the restaurant, from the gleaming stainless steel of the open kitchen, the stylish muted gold, blue and terra cotta color palette used throughout the interior. Seating options plentiful - both booths and tables are available.  The loud background music, a heavy dose of soft rock from 70's and 80's seemed louder than necessary in a near empty restaurant.The limited menu in place when I visited had burgers, pizzas and sandwiches.  The sandwiches do not come with any sides, but there are a handful of a la carte options: fries ($4 for a small order, $7 for a large), soup (pricey at $6 for a cup) and a salad (no description $7).  The restaurant also offers a Friday fish fry and has a separate weekend brunch menu.I ordered the chicken sandwich (described as slow roasted chicken with onions, green peppers and mushrooms served on a freshly baked roll) for $9.  While the chicken was moist and tender, it needed a fairly liberal dose of salt.  The lightly sautéed red, orange and green peppers made the sandwich look visually appealing and added some textural contrast to my sandwich.  I felt the undercooked onions could have used more time in the sauté pan to enhance their flavor. While the menu indicated the sandwich came with mushrooms, I did not notice any of them.  The toasted homemade bun had fantastic flavor and just the right density.  I liked but not loved this sandwich - even when I added more salt, this dish lacked any punch, nothing to make it memorable.  As I mentioned earlier, my meal did not come with a side, but during the course of my meal, by server offered me a small sample of the roasted squash soup which ended up being the highlight of my visit.  The soup was more like a puree, but was packed with flavor that comes from slow roasting the squash.  Unlike my sandwich, the soup was masterfully seasoned.  The person that prepared that dish displayed some mad cooking chops.While that soup was the pinnacle of my experience, the service was the nadir.  From the moment I set foot in the restaurant, confusion reigned.  For starters, here was no host station, so it was unclear whether I should order at the counter or wait to be seated.  After I stood confused for about a minute in the middle of the restaurant, a server finally saw my perplexed look and indicated I could sit where ever I wanted.  After grabbing a seat in one of the booths in the back of the establishment, the server quickly came by with a menu and a glass of water.  Then nothing for 10 awkward minutes.  There were only three other sets of patrons, so it wasn't like the restaurant was at capacity.  My food came quickly once I finally ordered, but it was delivered with no silverware or napkins.  When I needed salt for my under-seasoned sandwich, I had to wander around the dining area looking for my server because she never checked in after delivering my food.  Same story when I realized I needed some silverware to eat my unwieldy sandwich - get up and hunt for utensils.  While the Yelp business listing indicates that Max's has free wi-fi, when I asked my server for the password, she indicated it is not available for customers.  To be fair, my server was quite personable when I interacted with her, but it seemed like she had no serving experience and little training from management. Will I visit Max's again...probably, the potential from my tiny sample of the magnificent squash soup gives me reason to be optimistic.  But I'll probably wait six months to give the restaurant time to work through the service issues and fine tune the menu.
Inna Gadda di Pizza=Items Ordered:Tomato Pie with PepperoniWhite Pie with Artichoke HeartsCannoliTiramisuBlack and White CookieLocated in the increasingly busy Pawn Plaza, but still more of a 'secret' than the unnamed space owned by the same group at The Cosmopolitan, Inna Godda di Pizza occupies the downstairs corner pocket furthest from The Strip and featuring similar pies to those that have impressed both critics as well as the late night Marquee crowd ever since opening a visit to the month old space was every bit as good as the original, even an early morning oven malfunction not preventing a pair of freshly made pies from shining.Not remotely a New Yorker, nor one to romanticize late nights slurping a soggy "99cent slice," it was with the same standards and biases as always that I entered Inna Gadda di Pizza, and although Foghat played in place of expected Iron Butterfly while the owner explained that an overnight oven shutdown had delayed the day's preparations it was with a little patience and conversation that minutes passed, each dough rolled out and hand stretched before careful topping, the $3 Red and $3.50 White by-the-slice options quickly sold to a steady stream of traffic, the vast majority visiting from out of town.Proudly touting the use of ingredients that justify paying a few cents more per bite, suffice it to say that compared to "Secret Pizza" the prices trend a bit lower at the new location, and with a nice char imparted to the crust by "about ten minutes at five-fifty" both the bright and zingy red sauce beneath melted Mozz and garlic cream with dollops of ricotta plus house-smoked tomatoes were on par with the best in the genre, the fifty-cent toppings and absolute steal for a handful of marinated artichoke hearts while pepperoni was a touch oily and less well-spiced than expected.Surprisingly offering three desserts, all made n house and ranging $2-$4 each, anyone filling cannoli to-order deserves support and taking the time to match crisp shells to sweet cheese tinged in citrus the two-bite pastries were delightfully light yet extremely flavorful, a spot less less praise offered for a small bowl of tiramisu that seemed a bit too soggy at its base despite generous coffee notes while the seemingly out-of-place Black & White was smaller than most, yet moist and fluffy enough that you may want two.****About as good as it gets for a "slice shop" particularly on Las Vegas Boulevard for less than $4, Inna Gadda di Pizza is only likely to get better with time and seasoning of the ovens, a few small tweaks potentially capable of making this the first "must-visit" spot at Pawn Plaza for locals as well as tourists.White pizza, $3.50 by the slice and incredible: mozzarella, garlic cream, dollops of ricotta, house-smoked tomatoes, and a drizzle of pesto. Definitely going to add artichokes or anchovies next time!Space is small with pizzas on display ready to toss in the oven. Shakers of oregano, parm, and red pepper flakes available on your way out, covered outdoor patio seating available. Service was super friendly. Despite being a bustling area, it was a quick stop to grab a slice at a good price. Bonus points for the "real talk" at the bottom of the menu: NO RANCH DRESSING!
Nani Restaurant=Nani Restaurant made a favorable impression during recent weekday lunch foray.  As an unabashed multi-cultural dumplingphile, I was pleased to see the early favorable reviews.  So I convinced a couple of co-workers to join me for a whirlwind trip through Nani's dim sum menu.  It's been years since I visited this location; I think it was an ill-fated Mongolian stir-fry place in that iteration.  The new owners definitely classed the place up with a thorough renovation, adding plenty of stylish lighting to give the place a more chic vibe (as best you can for an old all you can eat buffet location).  The host immediately greeted us and led us to our table.  Our server appeared before we were settled in and shared both the lunch menu (mainly Americanized Chinese dishes) and the expansive dim sum menu.  After a vigorous debate over the merits of many of the dim sum options, we decided on the pork pot stickers, shrimp and pork dumplings, BBQ pork buns and one of spare rib options,  (Alas, no one was willing to sample the chicken feet with me - I had to save that dish for another time).  One of my co-workers also ordered the sesame chicken entrée from the lunch menu.  Shortly after we placed our order, the steam baskets with our dim sum offerings started hitting our table.  The exterior of the pot stickers had an impressive brown sear and the filling brimmed with porcine goodness.  For some unknown reason, the podstickers were bereft of any dipping sauce, which is an almost unpardonable omission.  The BBQ Pork bun were the weak link of the meal, with a too sweet bun and just a thimbleful of underseasoned pork (nothing like the version of this dish than I devoured at Umami earlier this year).The bone-in pork spareribs were the showstopper of our meal.  Packed in a flavorful broth, this dish provided a mouthful of flavor with every bite.  Also impressive were the delectable shrimp and pork dumplings, though they also could have benefited from a dipping sauce.I felt the kitchen did an admirable job with the sesame chicken, which provided a pleasing crunch with every bite.  For a new restaurant that has had little fanfare, there was an active midweek lunch service.  Many restaurants have come and gone from this building, hopefully Nani can break the curse of this location.  There are far many dim sum offerings that I have yet to try.I learned about Nani thanks to Yelp and immediately added it to my "to try" list. Little did I know it would only be a few days later that I'd be asked me to decide where to meet someone for lunch. I am so happy we came here! The location is tucked just a bit out of the way, so folks might miss it if they're driving through, but it's absolutely worth checking out. I'd never visited the previous iterations, but agree with other reviewers who say that the interior is well done. For me, this doesn't always matter as much if the food is good, but I found it notable in this case.This is my first experience with Dim Sum, so I can't speak to authenticity or compare to other locations. What I can say is that I love most any Asian cuisine I've tried and thought it was amazing. It doesn't hurt that I'm a fan of dumplings of pretty much any heritage. We spent most of our time going over the vast menus. First we were handed the lunch menu, which seemed to cover the sorts of American-Chinese dishes I grew up with so we skipped it altogether. The dim sum menu was completely new to me, and my partner was enthralled by their main menu, which is HUGE. We were warned that the dishes in the main menu were meant to serve more than one person, and they were right, we had some leftovers to share with our housemates.I realized shortly after getting through the dim sum menu that I'd have to take a look at the rest later. I already wanted to try more than I could eat... so I chose the beef brisket with rice noodle in a pot, the pan fried vegetable and pork bun, and the sweet custard roll. Everything was delicious, although I was surprised by the ratio of bun to limited filling and just a little put off by the skin and fat/cartilage in the pot. Of course, I realize that's probably more traditional than what I'm used to so I just picked through it. The flavor was very good. I shared those leftovers with one of my housemates when I got home and he ate the rest, so it's clearly a matter of preference. The custard rolls were perfect... great fluffy texture while not too sweet. Mmm.This particular companion is more adventurous than I am when it comes to food, so many options on the menu were tantalizing to him. He ended up ordering the ox tongue with tripe in chili sauce and loved it. From the dim sum menu he chose the shrimp crepes, which received an emphatic thumbs up while chewing. He's going to have to find someone else to try the chicken feet or octopus with, but I appreciate that those items are on the menu.Service was great. Our waitress checked in regularly and another young lady checked in with us to see if we had any questions. She was extremely helpful to us first-timers. I was surprised by how quickly our dishes started coming out; we were eating in no-time. Extra bonus points for their tea service. I had a nice big metal pot of green tea to myself. No dinky mini-teapot, and this baby stayed HOT the whole time we were there. This alone made me pretty happy, but add everything else and I simply can't wait to come back again and again to continue trying other items on their menu.
Cafe Hollander=Cafe Hollander comes to Madison in a big way... They opened a stunningly beautiful, brand-new restaurant at Hilldale that seats 450 - featuring an amazing second floor patio, retractable roof, and garage door windows around the whole first floor that open. The Madison restaurant scene has escalated to another level, especially in the Hilldale area.We visited during the soft opening, so there were some hiccups, but if it's as good as the Milwaukee location, things will be great in no time. Out of the 7 in our group, most either liked or loved their food. Their beer selection and brunch menu is strong, and that's what they focus on.Prices are not too high but don't get comfortable, they add up quickly - $9 for a bloody, $5-7 for beer, $2 extra for side salad, etc.3-stars, but *barely*. I've been here a few times now, including a brunch, and I'm just not feeling it. + The place is MASSIVE. They can seat nearly 500 people here. It's a monstrous location.- Bigger isn't better. Despite the huge seating capacity, the actual bar is rather small (seats maybe 20?), and the physical/actual bar offers the only "first come, first served" seating. All other seating is by reservation only, including hightops in the bar area.+ Despite the huge, open space, noise levels are well-maintained- No waiting space, aside from the aforementioned smallish bar with very limited seats+ Super friendly hosts/hostesses+ iPad/we'll-text-you-when-your-table's-ready system is genius, and works well+ Huge beer menu, although most are in bottles- Beer menu is difficult to read, especially in low light (tiny font & glossy pages)- Taps are rather mundane with few local offerings (all things relative)+ Decent menu- Nothing on the menu is outstanding or particularly noteworthy- It's pricey, given the overall quality of the food+ Kitchen was *fast* at dinner time (food arrived within 5 minutes)- Kitchen was *glacially slow* during brunch and screwed-up every order - Service is hit-or-miss, both at the bar and at tablesBrunch experience details:Met group of friends here for brunch. We arrived just minutes after they opened for the day, and were immediately seated. It took 20+ minutes and three trips to the hostess station before a waitress stopped by with water/menus. The entire visit was a nightmare... drinks were made wrong, coffees were forgotten and then rarely refilled, food orders were all incorrect, and our server was completely absent. We spent 2 hours and 25 minutes there for a brunch and it's time I'll never get back. I called the manager, who apologized profusely and admitted they were a bit overwhelmed at the time... Lunch details:Went here with a group of coworkers for lunch; seated fairly quickly and had decent service, but nothing remarkable. Most folks liked their food, but I felt many items were overly greasy (Brussels Sprouts were drenched in oil). Sampled many items via coworkers, and most were rather plain and reminded me of what I'd find at any national chain like Applebee's, Olive Garden, or Chili's.Dinner details:Swung by here around 7pm on a Wednesday night, some 5-6 weeks after the place opened. Wait time for a table for two was 45-55 minutes. Really???? I didn't wait that long for a table at Nobu in NYC. Oye. Madisonian's love a new restaurant. Eventually found seats at the bar, where service was decent, but nothing great. One bartender was personable, the other two were "all business" and made me feel rushed and much like I was a number. Food during dinner was overly salty and tasted very "commercial." Nothing great. Given the choice, I'd *much* rather visit Oliver's Public House, Forequarter, or even Mr Brews. It's a cool looking place, but looks only get you so far.
El Guero Canelo=It is really cool that we now have this famous Tucson restaurant in the Phoenix valley. Hot Dogs are one of my favorite past times and I deciced to go and check them out sooner than later.This is an old Discount tire store where they remodeled the garage section into a seating area and turned the waiting room into their bakery. The acoustics are rather noisy and they are continuously calling out order numbers over the ear numbing speaker system. Ordered two of the Sonoran Dogs with everything on them and a large Carmelo which comes with Beef, Beans and melted Cheese. They also have a really nice salsa bar with plenty of items to enhance the flavors of your meal.The Hot Dogs were pretty good but not the best in town. The buns are not as sweet as they usually are at other places and a little more on the chewy side. It was difficult to taste the bacon and the flavors were a bit bland. The Caramelo was interestingly good and was even better with tons of added goodies from the salsa bar.This place gets really busy and they do a pretty good job of getting the food out quickly. It was fun watching the excitement in all the happy customers as they sat down and ate with their extended families.I'm going to round up on this particular restaurant and figure that they are still ironing out some the typical problems with opening any new location.

Chef Marc's Trattoria=Last night I came to dinner here w/ a friend of mine who has known Chef Marc for many years. Chef Marc is a personable and talented man who has absolute passion for cooking and happiness of his customers.Better if you can believe it, than what I recall of his former restaurant Parma, I had the pleasure of tasting Marc's delicious Italian cuisine at his brand new restaurant located in a small strip center @ SW corner of Sahara & Durango, behind Lakeside Charlies.Shared appetizers were delicious...*Mozzarella en Carozza--Fresh mozzarella wedged in thin bread then fried, w/ tasty marinara dipping sauce.**Cold Seafood Salad--Wild shrimp, mussels, calamari, imported provolone, hot cherry peppers.My entree was delicious...Barbershop Bone-in Chicken Scarpariello...roasted w/ Italian sausage over polenta. A bit of a challenge w/ bone-in, but managed to act like a surgeon and savored the perfectly cooked juicy, tender organic chicken meat. Sausage had a nice tangy flavor. Polenta was very good. Green beans were al dente and excellent.Dessert was delicious...Creme Brulee that was torched tableside by Tracy, 1 of Marc's friendly servers. Sweet & flavorful w/ fresh berries.Nicely decorated upscale restaurant w/ cool wall decor, nice lighting & furnishings, and the sounds of enjoyable Ratpack background music that was a classy touch around this time of what would be Frank Sinatra's 100th birthday.Service was impeccable by our friendly server Lino, originally from Italy. And once again, Chef Marc is a true restaurant entrepreneur w/ passion and talent for his Italian cuisine. I highly recommend dining here!See 8 photos below...YELP 300 CHALLENGE 2015: #296
Boswell=Très bonne découverte ce soir !La salle est grande avec des tables classiques, des tables hautes et la possibilité d'aller au bar bien sur !Quand nous sommes arrivés vers 19h ca commençait à être pas mal plein, comme un vendredi soir !La déco est sympa, rien d'Exceptionnel mais j'ai bien accroché.Par contre qui dit grande salle dit BEAUCOUP de bruit. N'y allez pas pour discuter tranquillement avec quelqu'un car ce n'est pas cette ambiance. Sans pour autant dire que les gens crient ou font la fête mais c'est la somme de toutes les discussions qui fait ce brouhaha.Au niveau de la bière il y a une super carte. Que des microbrasseries et des supers choix. On a demandé à goûter les bières et on a pu ainsi choisir en connaissance de cause. Sur les 6 échantillons on a vraiment accroché sur 5. Cela prouve que la sélection est plus que propre si je puis dire !Les verres peuvent varier de 8 à 16oz suivant la bière que vous prendrez et le prix est de 6$ taxes incluse. Très satisfait de la qualité et de la sélection.Nous avons aussi pris des plats. Déjà les frites supers bonnes, vraiment bien accroché !J'ai pris des fajitas au poulet marinés qui étaient aussi très bonnes et bien assaisonnées. Servi soit avec frites soit avec salade. Le tout pour seulement 10$ :)Plusieurs plats sont passés et le fish n chip donnait vraiment envie, le morceau de poisson était juste énorme !!!! Le tartare de saumon avait l'air fort appétissant et en bonne portion pour 12$.Vraiment dur de faire son choix, il faudra y retourner pour tester d'autres choses :)En conclusion de part le choix de bière, de plat je ne peux que conseiller ce bar.Nous y retournerons de sur !
WuHu Noodle=I had the pleasure of attending the YEE here recently.  I enjoyed the food and made plans then to come back.  I brought the wife along as like me she lives Asian cuisine.    We started out with the Siu Mai and Szechuan Dumplings.  The Siu Mai were tasty and seemed much larger than other places.  The dumplings were perfect and not too spicy.  For the main course we had the Pad Thai, Mongolian Beef and Wuhu Beef Fried Rice.  The Pad Thai was the least favorite thing we ordered.  The noodles were stuck together and it had a sour taste.  The Beef Fried Rice was very good.  Lots of great tasting beef paired with the tasty fried rice.  The Mongolian Beef was well prepared with tensor beef and veggies.  The sauce was a great compliment to the delicious dish.     We had some leftovers and added a few item for our daughter.   Got her the Tonkotsu Ramen, Walnut Shrimp and Pot Stickers.  She loved the Walnut Shrimp and Pit Stickers.  The Ramen was very good also as I gave it a try.  She didn't share the shrimp or pot stickers!     Being in a casino is kind of a problem for me as I don't care for the smoke walk to get to a restaurant.  The good thing is the Silverton is not that bad compared to many casinos.  The prices at Wuhu are very good and what you get will please your Asian food cravings.  They have a variety of food from all over Asia.  It is well prepared with fresh ingredients.  This is not a high end place but you get good food and it comes to your table pretty fast.  If I am in the area I will definitely come back.
Bouchon Bakery at The Venetian=Generally speaking, I don't get cravings for sweets and desserts like how I do with  pho and ramen.  If I were to ever get the urge though, there's a pretty good chance it would be for a delicious, French macaron.  Well, other than ice cream of course.  Or a fresh, homemade chocolate chip cookie.  A thin one, with slightly crisp edges, a golden brown bottom, and a soft, chewy center with plenty of melted chocolate chips.  Yeaaaaahhhhh, that'd be good....wait, what was I talking about?While most French bakeries offer up smaller, near bite-sized macarons, I love how Bouchon's are almost the size of your palm.  Even though that means you pay a little more for each cookie, it also means you have that much more to enjoy.  And enjoy you will, with a light, crisp exterior sandwiching a sweet and chewy filling.  Although I've yet to try the Pistacio flavor myself, I've heard plenty of good things about it from friends.  For me, my favorite has been their Espresso Macaron - loaded with a rich, coffee flavor, it won me over after just one bite.Since this Bouchon Bakery is really more of an outlet/coffee stand in the Venetian (by the theater), the selection is smaller compared to what their actual "bakery" locations can offer.  However, it still tastes just as good, and that's what matters most, right?  After all, if you start to crave a macaron, it's better to be stuck choosing from just a few varieties than to not have any to choose from at all!After my dinner at B&B Burger where no dessert is offered, I walked around the corner to this little spot where I got a pumpkin tart.  The tart was very good and just what I'd expect from Bouchon.  The only problem with this small outlet near the sports book and clock tower is there is no place to sit.  It is almost entirely takeout.The tart was boxed which wasn't necessary.  I ended up removing the tart from the box and using one of their plastic forks to start eating the tart.  I soon gave up and picked it up and ate it like that.There's a water dispenser at the bar with the plasticware and sugars/creams for coffee, but it wasn't working.  After finishing, I went to the nearest bathroom in the casino to wash my hands.A great little pastry and a perfect end to a dinner somewhere else!
Taco Rico=Decent lunch spot in DTLV. Restaurant itself is always clean and the cashier and cook are always very friendly and courteous. So far, I've tried the chicken, steak, carnitas, and barbacoa tacos, they're all equally delicious, but beware, barbacoa tends to make the tortillas soggy so if you order an assortment of different meats like I do, eat the barbacoa first.I always go with the taco special they have, which is a great deal. 4 tacos with beans, rice, and a drink for $8.99, service is always fast so I never have to wait long to receive my food, which is always a plus considering I only have a one hour lunch break. So if you're in the hood, definitely give Taco Rico a chance.
La Petite Mort=As part of a surprise birthday dinner we were indeed pleasantly surprised to be seated at la Petit Mort. There was a really warm welcome and we were very well taken care of. The girl serving us was extremely knowledgeable and could explain drinks and dishes to the finest detail, including little enticing morsels of flavour explanations. They serve a menu of 3 starter, mains and desserts. The highlight for myself was indeed the rare cooked flat iron steak. Perfectly cooked and extremely tender. Their cocktail list is a joy to read.They do offer a large range of classic cocktails made to measure and personal preferences. I was very pleased with my earl grey old fashioned (though I personally prefer the single large rock of ice)My biggest surprise was how reasonable the prices are compared to other places of similar quality (Kitchin, Scan & Scally et al) The food and service is certainly up to par. Sure these other places have won awards, but I did experience a similar (if not BETTER) experience in la Petit Mort - and as they are just starting out they may collect their rewards later on. Highly recommended and certainly worthy of revisiting often.
Sa Bai On The Fly=Sa Bai On The Fly- Oh My! On this dreary cold day I was in a spicy curry mood, and seeing all the great reviews for this restaurant piqued my interest in wanting to try it out. I ordered an avocado curry ($10) and Thai eggplant ($8). On the phone I was only offered "mild" or "medium" options of spiciness. Kind of odd, do they really not make things "hot" spicy? I went with the medium level and my order would be ready for pick up in 20 minutes.The order was ready right on time and packaged very well. It smelled amazing in the car, and it was a huge portion of food for each dish. The avocado dish is a jazzed up green curry with the addition of sliced and chunk avocados to the mixture of chicken, basil, and other vegetables. I think it was a good "medium" level of spiciness, just enough spice to let you know it was there without the need for a fire hydrant's worth of water afterwards. The Thai eggplant was a hefty portion of pork, eggplant, and other veggies and was more delicate tasting than the bold curry.The space inside the restaurant is nicely decorated but very tiny. In addition to ordering by phone, you can also order online through their website.Overall, I'd definitely be interested in coming here again to try more dishes.
Buck & Rider=LGO Hospitality does it again... I couldn't wait to try Buck & Rider, and now that I have, I can't wait to return!  This hot new seafood centric restaurant has only been open for a week, but you wouldn't know it based on our experience.My husband and I enjoyed an early dinner date night at newly opened B&R tonight and had a fun and memorable meal.  It's group service, but Mia was our main server and did a fabulous job!  We enjoyed sharing the following:-a half dozen oysters-snapper ceviche-lobster roll-calamariIt was all fresh and delicious, and paired perfectly with the glass of wine (Domaine Serge Les Boursicote Sancerre) I selected.  It's worth noting that they also offer a solid cocktail list for all of you cocktail connoseiurs ;)We sat inside but right on the border of the outdoor patio... We enjoyed an almost perfect view of Camelback mountain.  I say "almost perfect" as there is also a view of a Jack in the Box sign that gets in the way ;)The bathrooms are spacious, clean, and classy, as is the architecture of the restaurant; all fitting of the inspiration behind the space; a house located in a swanky beach town on the Australian coast.In addition to complimentary valet, B&R offers patrons LGO's signature sea salt chocolate chip cookies on your way out... it is the perfect sweet ending to your meal.  For now B&R is open for dinner only, 6 days a week (closed Monday).  I hope they will extend their hours into lunch soon.  This is definitely a welcome addition to the 'hood!
Peoria Artisan Brewery=Let me start off by saying... it's not all their fault. And I'm going to start with what I liked. The food was really good. My husband had their special of the day. It was a Short Rib over Garlic Butter Grits. He said it was the best short ribs he has ever had, and the most tender. The Pub Burger was good! I liked how the bacon mixed in with the burger meat made it fall apart yummy. Everyone thought that The Deviled Eggs were WAYYYY too salty. If the salt was toned down a little it would have been much better, might have just been a bad batch. The Mac & Cheese bites were really good, both crunchy and gooey.  The beer selection was a nice selection of rotating crafter beers. The flights were priced pretty decently. Here is where my first -1 star comes in. I called not long after they opened and made a reservation for 9 people at 7:30 that night. The girl said "Let me check, put me on hold about 2 minutes. Came back and said "That should be no problem! Would you like outdoor seating or in door seating." I told her I think in-door would be best. She said "See you at 7:30."     My friend go there before me and was told that they had no reservation at 7:30 for a party of 9 under Ashley. So I came in and told them I had talked to a girl that morning that told me they even had room for inside or outside. I was then told "Well the girl that was working up front this morning went home sick. She is the one who probably took your reservations." Ok... and it's not in writing anywhere? I don't understand. And the staff seemed annoyed WITH ME!? How this is all my problem I do not understand.   So even after all of this me and my 8 friends decided to stay and wait for a table to open up. It was a Saturday night and every place was going to be a wait, due to Holiday parties. We went to the bar and got some beers and flights. The bar tender was very nice and patient with us, as some of my friends were not familiar with craft beers and had to do some sampling. After we were seated, everything went very smoothly. The service was nice, the food was good, and so was the beer. My Second -1 star is because the owner was there. I even heard him say he was going to wait on a table. In my experience, a manager/owner should have come to us and talked to us. Maybe apologized for what happened. I don't need anything for free, but at least come and speak with me. The only person who spoke with me about the entire thing was the young hostess. Who I felt bad for because its not her fault. I hope that a lot was learned from this mistake. However, I will be back. I really loved the atmosphere. Very chic, modern and a little bit rustic. It is very small but I don't mind that. When you walk in to the dining room you see what I think was about 8 or more long bench seats and bench type tables. Right behind those there's a Large Bar with lots of bar seating, both on the inside and outside of the bar. They had a cute little patio on the other side of the bar where we ended up sitting. They had heat lamps that worked very well and kept us pretty warm. A few lights and plants outside. I enjoyed a lot of things about this place. So I hope to come back and give this place 5 stars. But as of right now I am a little embarrassed and upset that I told my friends from out of town I had made these plans only to end up looking a little foolish. It ruined the experience a little bit.
Sushi Neko=When Shuseki closed it doors, I've waited to see what will pop up next to take its place. I was pleasantly surprised that another AYCE sushi joint finally emerged! The staff surprisingly reported it's the same owner of Sakana and Hwaro. Woot! Woot!I like the way the menu is set up. It's organized and the font size is easy to read. They truly revived the interior decor, but kept the dining areas the same set up as the previous restaurant. It's in the same plaza as Kaba Curry, Cafe Teaze, and Swish. This place gets a BIG PLUS for offering half rolls, allowing you to expand your options. The dinner price of $25.95 and lunch price of $20.95 are comparable to other AYCE sushi. There is a time limit. 80 min for dinner and 60 min for lunch. I am not going to bore anyone how the appetizers, skewers, and sushi tasted like ;) I think that each sushi restaurant has its own distinctive taste and with their own signature sauces. It's whatever floats your boat! You decide! LOL! The fish to rice ratio gets another great applause! I would definitely come back since I barely tasted the items on the menu.
Hussong's Cantina=Though the name resonates with an upper middle aged crowd, this Summerlin eatery falls short in many categories and is simply not worth the time or money. Despite its rich long term history due to its namesake and original location, this restaurant seems like it just tries too hard to be hip and cool and ends up resembling something more like Carl's Jr. but lacking the cheap eats value. When you enter, you are asked to order from a counter. Then you can opt for "full service" where the waitstaff will supposedly check on you and refill your drinks. To opt for this service you must leave a CC at the counter to establish an open tab, regardless of whether or not you accrue additional charges. Then once you order, you are given a number and told your food will be delivered to your table. How they know who is "full service" and who isn't I have no idea and it didn't really matter anyway as we left a CC with them yet not ONCE did a waiter come by to offer refills or check on us. We left the table to refill our own drinks from the soda fountain and collect our CC prior to departure. The best value we experienced here was our lack of need to tip. Overall, the only reason I gave a 2 star instead of 1 is I did enjoy the overall aesthetics. The kitschy 80's and 90's era toys like Stay Puft Marshmallow man and PeeWee Herman doll were nostalgic and cute. But when it comes to the food and service, stick to Carl's Jr. At least when they deliver the food they usually ask if you need anything else. Hussong's could learn a few things from them.I hate to say it, but I like this place. Some may be turned off the the over-flare-ification of the interior or the high-priced Mexican fare (at least compared to hole-in-the-wall spots). But, the tacos and street corn won me over. The char and prominent cotija flavor of the former make it worth getting, especially when it's free for checking in. As for the tacos, the pork belly is my favorite. Balanced sweet and savoriness, varied texture with the cabbage mix and most importantly it was topped with chicharrones. What's not to like? The barbacoa was a close runner-up. Who cares if it was messy with its sauce dripping everywhere. It's still bold flavored and delicious. Less noteworthy, but still decent were the chicken tacos and carnitas. Taco platters come with two tacos, which you can mix-and-match. Rice and beans can be hit or miss. The first time around the rice was better than almost any rice I've tried at a Mexican restaurant -- light, fluffy and buttery. The second time around... not so much. Still, Hussongs is a worthy spot to hit up as long as you don't mind paying a little more for tacos.3.5 Stars
Crust Chandler-Simply Italian=Argh... first impressions...Walked in the door around 8pm on a S-A-T-U-R-D-A-Y... NIGHT... and let me tell ya, it was hella loud son.  Like, The Metro nightclub in Riverside, three decades ago loud.  Like you have to yell at a girl to ask her to dance loud.  However, the iced tea was wonderfully tropical, and I should know, just coming from the tropics.I ordered the eggplant parm, because I love it, and can usually tell if a place is going to be good by how it turns out.  Fact: Carlo & Emilies has a great eggplant parm.  Even Buca has a pretty good eggplant parm... but not these guys.  It also came with fettuccine and red sauce, topped with a croissant.  Yeaaaah, like my mom used to make... from a canned sauce.Granted, I should walk away with a lesson learned, but I'll return to try the pizza... next time with earplugs.
Feeney's Weenies=Hot diggity dog!  A good hot dog place to replace my fave DD.If you like a plain dog or one of the specialties of the house, you won't be disappointed.  A great place to get a quick dog and take the kids.  I have had the Smokehouse with fries and was so pleased.  The menu includes a Mac & Cheese dog - oreo cheesecake squares - chicken and a veggie.  Only one small hightop table so it is really take out.  But if in the mood for a dog, this is the place!
Flock & Fowl=This place serves unbelievable Hainin chicken rice and chicken wings.  I got both when I went.  The chicken rice matches perfectly cooked and deboned chicken (no taking shards out of your mouth) with fantastically seasoned rice.  It came with 3 dipping sauces.  All of the sauces would be fine just served with the seasoned rice but they took the chicken to another level.  Everyone just devoured our plates.Chicken wings might be even better.  I don't know what they put in the sauce but it was out of this world and the wings are slightly crispy on the outside and perfectly cooked on the inside.  I can't say enough good things about this place.I'm really shocked we have such a good Hainan chicken place here in Las Vegas.  No one else serves a halfway decent version of it.  And this is better than anything I've had in Taiwan and Los Angeles.My wishes have been granted and I no longer need to make a 4-5 hour drive to LA to go to Savoy Kitchen for my favorite Singaporean treat - Hainan Chicken and rice.This is hands down the best hainan chicken and rice I've ever had.  A few other places in town serve it but the quality, preparation, execution, and flavor don't come close to Flock.The chicken is silky smooth, moist.  Rice is fragrant with chicken essence.  I love pouring some of the rich broth over and the sauces are ridiculously good.   Love the ginger scallion and the chili packs a punch but you can then pair it with the sweet soy. The chicken wings are bursting with soulfulness - i used to work on this side of town- i wish I did bc I would be here 3-4x a week.  That's how much I love hainan chicken and rice.   Check out Anthony Bourdains Singapore trip to the hawker centers to see what this is all bout if you don't know about hainan chicken and rice.Jenny is one of the sweetest people in Vegas! Came in during their soft opening, and they have completely transformed the space. I really dig the textured wall paper, and the modern minimal decor with farmhouse accents.  Unfortunately, when I visited they were out of rice- I'll have to return to try their Hainan chicken dish, but I was thoroughly impressed with the items I did try, and Jenny's top-notch, friendly service.CHOPPED SALAD: Lettuce, kale, avocado, almonds, fried shallots, seasonal veg, and sesame vin. The dressing was light but flavorful, and the seasonal vegetables on this visit included red grapes and sweet plum tomatoes. It was a shockingly fresh and flavorful salad, and adding the fried chicken filet on top makes it a filling meal.TWICE COOKED SICHUAN CHICKEN WINGS: Available by the half or full pound, these are damn delicious. Slightly sticky, sweetly sauced, with great flavor. Definitely a win for Sheridan Su! I'd say these are a must-get item.I'll be back for their five-spice chicken bao and the Hainan chicken! Heads up that they close at 3:30PM, so this is exclusively a lunch spot. They also have very limited seating (4 2-tops and one 4-top), since the space is very small. Props for having ample (and comfortable) seating for takeout orders or waiting customers!I flocked to Flock & Fowl today because I have followed Chef Su and Jenny around town from Great Bao to Fat Choy to here and also the Lucky Rice Night Market thing when it debuted here.  They are a great team.  I freakin' love Hainan chicken rice and my main exposure to it was in Thailand.  I had some at a cheap place mentioned in Lonely Planet in Bangkok on my honeymoon, then again in the Bangkok Airways lounge in the Bangkok Airport, where I think I ate 8 plates of it (in 2011).  Fast forward to summer 2014 and Eric R. and I flew from Bali to Bangkok to Tokyo to the US.  We had a long layover in Bangkok (during the coup, and didn't tell anyone we were flying through there - the government shut off the a/c in the airport so I actually passed out)...first though we stopped at a random restaurant in the airport and I got Hainan chicken rice then passed out in the hot restaurant and then Eric R. dragged me to the gate to Tokyo where I passed out from the heat and exhaustion again.I do not know when I will actually get to Singapore (where this the national dish), Hainan, or Malaysia any time soon, so I am often on the hunt for this dish.  There are a few places that have it in town but...eh!  In the Little Apple where I live, we have a place that serves cao mun guy (Thai version of this dish) but the chicken is dry.This dish at Flock & Fowl.....well....the chicken is MOIST! and organic, free range fowl!  No foul here, just fowl.  It was so moist that it needed no sauce, seriously.  The rice was delicious and flavorful.  It was served with pickled mustard greens and cucumbers, broth, plus 3 dipping sauces made in house: sesame soy, ginger-scallion, and sambal.  I liked all of the sauces, and dipped my chicken in a random sauce every bite.  Then I drizzled the sauces on the rice.  I wanted an egg but the last one was ordered by the person before me = darn!  So I took a cab here from the Venetian because I was too impatient to wait for the Deuce.  Due to its location on Sahara with lanes only going westbound and a major accident southbound on Vegas Blvd., I decided to walk back.  Fueled by fowl, I flocked back to Caesars Palace where I returned to my conference, feet burning but tummy smiling.  I hope to come back when the restaurant is out of the soft opening.  I also had a green milk tea which Jenny made to order and adjusted sweetness to my taste (I guess I am a bitter gal because I like unsweetened, bitter green tea).  I am pretty fly for a fowl girl (I am what I eat)!  If only I could have flown from the restaurant to my destination.  Too bad I am leaving or I could go to a foot spa on Spring Mountain.  Flock to this place but be patient as the restaurant works out its opening.  According to Jenny, it is meant for take-out which is why there is limited seating and no public restroom.This is such a great place with great people - Sheridan and Jenny are so wonderful and hospitable! The menu is simple, but it's all you need to fulfill your poultry needs. They use Mary's free-range organic chicken for all their dishes. There's either poached chicken, fried chicken tenders, or chicken wings.Hainan Chicken Rice ($8.99): poached chicken and rice cooked in chicken fat with pickled cucumbers and mustard greens. Served with housemade soy, ginger scallion, and sambal sauces, and a side of chicken broth. I added a fried egg ($1.99) and Chinese sausage ($1.99). This dish is phenomenal. It's Asian comfort food at its finest. Every element is so wonderful. The chicken, the rice, and especially the housemade sauces. I had to get extra ginger scallion. Yum. I could eat this all the time.Mrs. Han's Twice-Cooked Szechuan Chicken Wings and Thai Style Chicken Wings: fish sauce, garlic, and lemon (1 pound, $7.99). Both extremely flavorful! Also, just really great wings. You get a cute metal bucket to put your bones.I'm definitely going back to try the other dishes, but the Hainan Chicken Rice is a must on every visit!Sheridan Su and Jenny Wong have done it again. Their success with Fat Choy is due to their great business sense and people skills: offer good food at affordable prices. Flock and Fowl just has more sophistication, shall I say. They are located at the same complex as Golden Steer. Currently, their business hours are limited. Seating is limited (about 5 small tables) but you can always take your food to-go instead. They have about 5 organic poultry menu items/combos. But the freshly made drinks and the Hainan chicken rice are the business!Hainan Chicken Rice:First of all, I'm not a big fan of chicken skin that is white. If it's not BBQ'ed, fried, baked, or roasted to a golden brown - I refuse to eat it. I avoid Hainan chicken rice at all costs...but not this time! I'd have to say, this is the first Hainan chicken rice I've ever liked. Ok so maybe, I removed the chicken skin but the sliced chicken pieces were juicy. You dip the chicken in sambal, garlic ginger or soy sauce...or maybe, all 3. Then, eat it with the fragrant and flavorful rice with mustard greens. 5/5Bao Chicka Bao Bao:A big hot juicy chicken tender in a bao (steamed bun) with kale and sauce. There's nothing quite like it. Soft bao + crispy kale and chicken. Yuuuummm!!! 5/5Lemon Tea:Refreshing and fragrant without being too tart. Jenny makes a fresh batch from scratch as needed. 5/5Milk Green Tea:If you want a somewhat richer kind of drink, this is a good option. It's floral and slightly creamy. 4.5/5Jenny can make adjustments to your drink if you want it sweeter, more tart, etc. They're genuinely nice. They remember customers' names. They take time to chat with you.I have been to Chef Sheridan Su's Fat Choy restaurant in the Eureka Casino and I was intrigued when I learned that he opened a new place with a very limited menu of Hainan chicken and four other items.Six of us decided to meet for lunch yesterday and it would give me the chance to try the Hainan chicken about which I've read so much.We were served everything on the menu.  As it only contains 5 things plus a few à la carte items, everything was enough and very good.We started with fried chicken bao with kale pea sprout slaw.  The chicken was excellent, breaded just right, and with the slaw and the soft bao, it made one great sandwich.Next came two orders of chicken wings--one of Thai caramel and one called Mystery wings which are Szechuan style wings.  I had one of each.  I liked the Szechuan wings better but I'm not a chicken wing fan.  Generally when I order wings, I get boneless wings which aren't wings at all.  It's the messy fingers syndrome I don't like.Then we were served a Flock & Fowl salad with Cornish game hen pieces.  I had some salad but I didn't try the hen.  Last, we were brought two dishes--one with the Hainan poached chicken for which this place has become known and one with fried chicken tenders and rice.  Both dishes come with three sauces, ginger scallion, house made chile, and house made soy.  Both dishes come with rice and marinated cucumbers and preserved mustard greens.  The Hainan chicken comes with a cup of broth.  These dishes are excellent!!  The Hainan chicken is moist and delightfully boneless and the dipping sauces add to the taste of the chicken.  The tenders are excellent!This is a must return to place.  The bao, the tenders, and the Hainan chicken are all worthy of having again!  A couple of tips:  this is a lunch only restaurant open from 10:30-3:30.  It's a small place seating just 16 people so you may have a wait.  This is in a small strip mall on West Sahara near the freeway on the north side of Sahara.  Chef Su and Jenny Wong are most gracious people and you'll enjoy your stop here!Items Selected:Hainan Chicken Rice - Poached Chicken, Rice, House Sauces with added Chinese SausageFried Tenders and RiceChicken Wings - Mrs Han's Twice Cooked SzechuanChicken Wings - Thai Style with Fish Sauce, Garlic, and LemonCornish Game Hen with Kale, Tomato, Cucumber, Grape, Cranberry, Sunflower Seeds, Almonds, and Sesame Vinaigrette SaladBao-Chicka-Bao Bao with Kale SlawAchieving unlikely success in the middle of Eureka Casino with his Great Bow-turned-Brick+Mortar Fat Choy, Sheridan Su has seemingly found success where so many others have failed largely by keeping head down, eyes up, while focusing on quality of the product, and narrowing his focus even further at recently opened Flock & Fowl the young Chef finds has proven the rare double threat with a "do one thing and do it well" space that gets it right.Historically an adapted dish of early Chinese decedents from the Hainan Province, but offered throughout Asia and a few famous shops speckled around the United States, Su and his wife Jenny officially started obsessing over the dish following a visit to Taiwan and although a recipe of poached chicken and rice cooked in chicken fat may seem 'simple,' its perfection lies in the details - all of which the duo seems to have dialed in.No more fanciful in location than Fat Choy. the renovated space on Sahara next to a pawn shop and within view of the Strip Clubs on Industrial Road in the shadow of The Strip, Flock & Fowl seems as intentionally limited in its seating as it is in its menu and with Sheridan in the Kitchen as Jenny works the room orders are placed at the counter with service fast to follow, a "one of each" order seeing our table of six served in three successive rounds.Starting with Sheridan's longtime signature buns, in this case graced with crispy buttermilk soaked bird from Mary's Free Range with a bit of kale slaw and sauce, it almost seems silly that anyone could be excited about the pending opening of Chick-fil-A with such a thing available, each bite first met by pillowy bao before giving way to bittersweet flavors juxtaposing juicy, well-seasoned meat.Rare to be wowed by wings, though always open to a change of heart, round two saw Sheridan send out a couple extra bites of each flavor to that the whole table could enjoy, and with two flavors available the only real question is which of them to order, the Szechuan expectedly the 'hotter,' though certainly not ridiculous, while the fish-sauce tossed Thai style rivaled those at Pok-Pok for flavor, if not for size.Served all three entrees at once, easily enough to feed six adults when paired with that which had already come, suffice it to say that the Chicken tenders were perfectly fine if not particularly 'wowing' compared to the rest, yet when paired to the housemade chile sauce or chunky bits of garlic the three-piece order was an absolute steal for just $9, the crispy cornish hen another veritable steal alongside a complex and elegant salad for just a dollar more.Speaking last to the dish Su set out to perfect it should first be said that many at the table had never sought out a truly authentic version until this date, but whether a virgin or a veteran none at the table seemed to be disappointed in the silky broiled breast or the fluffy white rice, a $2 addition of spicy Chinese sausage every bit worth the surcharge while the bonus broth was chock-a-block full of flavor without being pumped up with salt or MSG.****Flawed only in the inherent limitations of space, an outsourced single dessert, and menu -  the later to be remedied by specials from time-to-time - Flock & Fowl has thus far shown that perhaps Las Vegas is ready to embrace such a focused concept - the early word almost universally favorable, but a fate that only time and the fickleness of local 'media' will tell.I had lunch recently with friends at Flock & Fowl, which from what I have read of the few reviews posted at the time, is all about their authentic preparation of Hainan Chicken Rice.  The restaurant is on a small stripmall lot on Sahara, and very close to Las Vegas Blvd and SLS.  I can see parking potentially be a problem, but there should be plenty of street parking on the side street.  It is a very small restaurant with very limited seating, so if you plan to go during your lunch break, go early and beat the crowd. Or expect to wait or have it prepared as a takeout.So what exactly is Hainan Chicken Rice, aka Hainanese Chicken Rice (海南雞飯)? It is considered one of the national dishes of Singapore, and is very popular in Vietnam and Thailand as well.  But it is based on a dish called Wen Chang Chicken (文昌雞) from the Southern Chinese province of Hainan (海南).  And each country that adapted this popular and tasty dish from early Chinese immigrants from Hainan put their own regional spin on it.  I have tried a few variations already (Taiwan, Thailand and Singapore), and as long as the chicken is cooked and still moist, it is already considered good by my book.The variation prepared and served at Flock & Fowl is one of the better ones for sure.  The chicken is moist and paired well with the fluffy white rice cooked with chicken fat (this might be the first time I have tried this variation, as I am more accustomed to the rice being cooked with chicken broth, which gives it more chicken flavor) and the homemade sambal chile sauce and the ginger scallion sauce.  For diners looking for a simple and healthful meal option, this is definitely a good choice.  Additional add-ons are available, such as egg and chinese sausage, which I think will make your dining experience even better.Even though Flock & Fowl is a small restaurant with a very modest number of tables and seats (I counted about 20), with a very small menu of 3-5 items, it should still be on every Yelper's radar of places to try.  I really enjoyed my experience at Flock & Fowl, and I think you will too.I might not have given five stars based on the food alone. Fortunately, I had much more to go on.Flock & Fowl is the newest venture by chef Sheridan Su of Fat Choy (and previously Great Bao and whatnot), and it's located in a strip mall off Sahara between the Strip and the highway. The food is quite good, as I'll detail momentarily. But if his wife Jenny Wong is there running the show and making you feel at home, you're in for a great experience. She remembers everyone's name, explains menu items at the register or when bringing them to your table, and is generally a master of service.Orders are placed at the window, with menus available on the board below the counter or in the frames on the side wall (with daily specials clipped on the side, which I failed to notice until the end). After paying, you can grab one of the few tables, assuming it's not packed for lunch rush (which I avoided having wisely arrived early), or take your order to-go. It doesn't seem wise to wait on the fried items though.Of the two types of chicken wings on the menu ($4.99 for 4, $7.99 for 8), they only had the Thai Caramel today. Maybe I'll try the Mystery Wings eventually, but I really can't remember having more delicious chicken wings than the Thai Caramel, even considering the best batches of my dad's homemade wings. These wings are large, juicy, and slathered with a potent sauce. Jenny described it as lemony, fish saucy, and garlicky, and it's all of those flavors along with a wings-appropriate level of sweetness.. Best wings ever? Dunno. Destination-worthy? Absolutely.Next, I had the Night Market Fried Chicken Bao ($3.79 for 1, $6.99 for 2). With a huge boneless piece of buttermilk fried chicken, kale, daikon sprouts, mustard greens, and sauce, it's at or near the level of Chef Sheridan's legendary pork belly bao (at Fat Choy). The delicious fried exterior makes up for what initially felt like a slightly underseasoned interior, and the accoutrements round out of the flavors and textures. Not that the chicken lacks any crunch or juiciness on its own. The bun did feel a little stretched, but it's a sufficient vessel for the goodness within.Finally, I got to my entree, the Hainanese Chicken Rice ($8.99) with additional Chinese sausage ($1.99) and chicken broth ($0.25). Tender, juicy boiled chicken with moist chicken fat rice are the basis, and some mustard greens and lightly pickled cucumbers are available on the side, but the overall flavor profile would feel slightly lacking without the Chinese sausage.Chicken isn't known for its intrinsic flavor, and while the spicy sambal sauce and the soy sauce are good, the ginger scallion sauce lacks all of the ubiquitous ginger kick. Also, the house-made broth did have rich chicken flavor, but it suffered greatly from lack of salt. Fortunately, the nearly fatal flaw seems to be masked by pouring it all over the rice and then adding sauces. It's not a perfect dish, so I wouldn't necessarily agree with the Signature Dish of the Year award recently bestowed upon it by the Desert Companion magazine, but I can see myself ordering it again, especially because the leftover portion grew on me.I also tasted my friend's Flock and Fowl Salad w/ Cornish Game Hen ($9.99). The salad was very impressive, with ingredients such as cranberries, avocado, pomegranate seeds, and tomatoes over fresh lettuce. As for the hen, I'll have to reserve judgment because I tried it without the accompanying salt and Szechuan pepper mixture, and it seemed lacking on its own.Lest you think that food is the only worthwhile type of consumable here, they have a good selection of iced and hot teas and coffees, available sweetened or unsweetened. I went to the "premium" section of the beverage menu for the freshly steeped jasmine green tea ($5). Jenny brought out the pot then poured in the boiling water, and you can take the leaves out and place it into a tiny metal bucket whenever you'd like the arrest the steeping process. I found that the first batch was very fragrant, but the jasmine scent was significantly muted in a second steeping of the same leaves. I did eventually find enough jasmine flavor, such that it dwarfs most jasmine teas that you'll find. but don't be surprised if there's a drop-off if you re-up.As I said before, service was terrific. At the end of the meal, Jenny brought us to-go boxes and bags, complimentary sauce to-go upon request, and a complimentary second helping of boiling water plus a to-go cup without request. It's technically not full service, but that's a technicality based on where you place your order. It's definitely the best service in recent (or any) memory.Flock & Fowl is only open for lunch (10:30-3:30) on Tuesday through Saturday so far, but it's a must-try for the Thai Caramel wings and for the hostess. Its location is accessible enough for tourists and just remote enough for locals, so unless you're a vegetarian, you really have no excuse not to stop by.A near perfect taste of Singapore's national dish for under $9 (Hawaii yeeps add $600 supplement and 5.5hrs of flying).  That's a savings of $13,700 (hey, if you're going to Singapore, you gotta fly Suite Class right?)Simply put, this is an authentic, closest tasting Hainanese chicken rice to the hawker stands of Singapore.  Boneless, tender, moist, not fatty pieces of chicken with a very pronounced chickeny flavor served with rice cooked in a rich chicken stock.  Add a whatever portion of dark soy, grated ginger and scallion oil, and fiery chili sauce before spooning the entire bite into your eagerly awaiting mouth.  Then, wow. Being so chickeny is helped along by the chicken is free range and cooked in a mother stock that is perpetually maintained (based on how this chicken taste, this is definitely the case).Four other items round out the menu, all chicken of course.  The "Hainan Fried Chicken Rice", good.  Moist, breaded, deep fried chicken tenders.  What's not to love.  The "Night Market Fried Chicken Bao", the same deep fried chicken in a bun (Chinese not hamburger), with hoisin, sesame seeds, and greens makes a nice starter but nothing compares to the chicken.As others have mentioned, this is a very small restaurant.  Go at opening or expect a wait.Service is mom and pop, family friendly.Vegas rocks out yet another serious Asian food find.
KINTHAI=When you're located in the same block as Weera Thai, you're going to have a hard time if your kitchen isn't up to par- the dining room is nice and going for a more upscale vibe, but they have cheap ($7) weekday lunch specials. But unfortunately the food just wasn't up to par for me.FISH CAKES APP: 5/$10 Small, oily, and a bit bland. I enjoyed the cucumber dipping sauce but this didn't pop needed a hit of acidity or something.PAPAYA SALAD: BF requested this and devoured the entire portion. Sauce was slightly spicy, did not like the half-frozen green beans used though.CRAB FRIED RICE: This was listed on the board as a daily special. Portion was large enough, and I like that the extra bit of attention and effort were put into presentation even though this was a takeout order. However, I asked for a spice level of 5 (on their 1-10 scale) and this had no spice whatsoever. I ended up dumping two cups of chili paste and some red pepper flakes into the dish to give it some heat. It's a huge pet peeve of mine to be asked for a spice level and then not even take it into account when cooking the dish. It was even on the receipt so I'm not sure who dropped the ball.Located in a blink-and-you'll-miss-it spot on Sahara next door to a leather goods shop, it's not necessarily a place I'll return- the food was fine, but didn't have anything about it to stand out from the sea of other thai places on the block.
Watts=It's been a while since I had a good pizza outside of little Italy. Opened a little over a week ago. Have to say the atmosphere it's quite pleasant. Has this bar feel to it and they brought back some of the 80s look with the old stereo, cassette box and old school phone. The staff was amazing and service super friendly. If ur a fan of thin pizza with a fantastic crust, this is a must!! I had the mushroom pizza and  wow! It's packed with all kinds of flavours. The first slice was all about trying to figure out the flavours. Sweet, salty, basil, types of mushrooms, and that crust! After that first slice I inhaled the rest.. The this pizza actually melts in your mouth..Margherita pizza  was was my other choice and lived it too. Flavours were a little more subtle. The cheese just oozing and the basil makes all the difference. Oh and that crust !! I'm one to always leave the crust behind but not this time. This place is a must go try.. And I'll keep wanting more. If u you're one not to eat the crust I dare you not to on this pizza!
Cafe Zupas=This was my first visit to a Cafe Zupas and I have to say it is decent for what it is.I wasn't in love with my panini and neither was my mom so I will probably steer clear of those in the future and just stick to regular sandwiches, soups and salads.My mushroom bisque was delightful. Creamy and rich with the right amount of mushrooms. I would come back just for soup when I'm in the mood again.The only thing I didn't care for was the restaurant layout. All the chairs ere huddled so closely together it made it pretty difficult for people to navigate around the restaurant since there was no clear path to the ordering line, trash or drink station. Everyone kept bumping into one another and it became quite irksome. Since they just recently opened I'm sure these are small tweaks that can be made to improve as they learn. The staff is all very new as well and it was slightly more difficult to order than it should've been given the fact that I had to repeat my order three separate times as I moved down the line. Might be a little easier if I could just say it once and someone could write it down. Not too hard for ordering one item but when I was trying to remember what everyone in my party wanted every time I had to repeat the entire order it became harder to recall with each subsequent interaction. Otherwise a decent quick eat spot for bites on the go.So I noticed some fellow Yelpers checking in here and since it just down the street from me just had to try it.  I love deli food and the thought of another good deli near me was too much to pass up on.  We each got a soup and sandwich combo and a couple of salads. I had the Turkey Bacon Avocado with the Wild Mushroom Soup.  The wife got the BBQ Pork with the Lobster Bisque and the daughter got the Crab Sandwich with the Cauliflower soup.   The Wild mushroom was very good.  Creamy and with those amazing tasty mushrooms.  It was exactly what I expected.  The Turkey Bacon Avocado sandwich was also very good.  The bread was still crisp and the turkey and bacon were pretty tasty.  It had a decent amount of avocado which was prefect as it added to the overall taste but didn't turn the sandwich into a mushy mess.  I did try the Lobster Bisque and Cauliflower soups and they were both very good.  The Lobster Bisque was chunky with more lobster than I expected.  I would definitely order it again.  The Cauliflower soup was creamy and surprisingly delicious.  I did not think I was going to like it but hey you just never know sometimes.  I did get  taste of the crab sandwich and it was pretty good too and would gladly order it again.  I didn't try the BBQ Pork sandwich but according to the wife it was nothing to write home about.  She said it was OK.  We got the Mango and Asian Chicken salads and although they were good I don't think they are a good value so I will stick with Soup and Sandwiches next time.      Since they had just recently opened I am not sure if the inside was done but it had a very casual feel to it.  I would call it modern industrial but hey I am no designer so not sure what they are going for as far as looks.  The staff was super friendly but too plentiful.  I would assume this is due to recently opening and doing OJT with new employees.  I ill be back but wait a month or so to see how this place matures.  A good addition to Rainbow and the SW of Vegas.
WaBa Grill=A little disappointed I stopped by WaBa Grill today for lunch. I thought I  would give WaBa Grill a try after reading so many positive reviews.WaBa Grill is  nice, clean and bright. I was  greeted as I entered the restaurant and the staff was very friendly. I placed my lunch order and sat down, and my entree was prepared quickly. On this visit I ordered a steak bowl with white rice and an ice tea.  I have to be honest my entree was not very good. The beef was tough, the rice was over cooked, and I did not particularly care for the sauce.I will probably revisit WaBa Grill in the near future and maybe try a different entree and see how that is.
Carbone=I joined six friends to try this new restaurant in Aria.  We ordered:Double order of Caesar saladAssorted baked clamsFoie grasFettuccini con funghiSpicy rigatoni vodkaSpaghetti JulienMeatballsVeal parmesan Chicken ScarparielloLasagna verdeBananas flambéeCarrot cakeWe were started with two types of bread and each got a piece of parmigiano-reggiano.  We were given menus and then we waited.  It was approximately 45 minutes from sitting down and getting menus until our order was taken.  The captain was busy with other tables and other things and we just waited.  After ordering, it was not long until the first items came out.  The good items of the meal were the Caesar salad, the foie gras, the spaghetti Julien, and the carrot cake.  The Julien had a very good mixture of flavors that was interesting and quite tasty.  However, there was not one pasta that was cooked anywhere near al dente.  Everything was overcooked something I wouldn't expect from a neighborhood Italian restaurant let alone one in a major Strip hotel.The poorest example for a dish was the lasagna verde at $75.  It is a large container.  It's cut and served by the captain.  The dish, however, was ruined by the burnt top.  Evidently it was put under a broiler to brown the top but someone blackened part of the top and it permeated every taste I took of my share.  As soon as I tasted the lasagna I said, "This doesn't taste good."  When our group doesn't finish everything on every serving plate--and the last piece of lasagna was not finished--you know something is wrong.  We finish dishes.  Not burnt ones, however.The room was quite loud.  It was very crowded and the noise from conversations filled the room.  The music was great.  It was from my era--basically from 1955 to 1965.  From the 45 minute wait, one can tell that service was a little lacking.  One thing that hit me wrong in the beginning happened when the captain was going over the specials.  He held a box with two large white truffles and he waved one of Carbone's rather large menus over the truffles so we could get the rich smell of the truffles.  I thought it was very patronizing.Two of us at my side of our round table had a blast of cold air coming down on us throughout the meal.  We both wore our jackets for much of the meal.  Having spent $100 including tip, I felt more than a bit disappointed.  There are so many very good Italian restaurants on and off the Strip that are doing better cooking than this and charging less.  Fool me once!Items Selected:Semolina BreadGarlic Bread and Pizza FocacciaSpicy PepperoniMarinated CauliflowerPeccorinoBaked ClamsFoie Gras VenezianaCaesar alla ZZTagliatelle with Shaved White TrufflesSpicy Rigatoni VodkaSpaghetti JulianFettuccine con FunghiOff-Menu MeatballsLasagna VerdeVeal Parmesan Chicken ScarparielloCarrot Cake with Ginger IcingBananas FlambeeRainbow CookiesLimoncelloHaving watched Carbone open to gratuitous fanfare from more than a dozen writers and industry folks the New York import had knowingly comped, it was not until I was able to gather a group large enough to properly sample the pricy Aria restaurant that I hazard to make a reservation, the results of a nearly three-hour meal with six friends far less impressive than any of the 'media' will openly pronounce.No doubt a splashy space, the original channeled for much of the lavish design and showy tableside service from Captains shining in red, Carbone is the brainchild of Rich Torrisi and Mario Carbone and famous for high prices for traditional "red sauce" classics the Las Vegas iteration raises the stakes even higher than the Manhattan original, a $64 Veal Parm and $75 Lasagna a mere tip of the iceberg on a menu with prices not displayed out front.Clearly trying to evoke an dining environment rare to be found in Las Vegas in the year 2015, entrance to Carbone begins at a podium of smiling young faces in front of a painting of Christopher Walken and with Rat Pack classics playing a bit too loudly overhead those with reservations are quickly whisked through an elegant lounge to one of three large rooms, the center featuring circular enclaves and several large tables with a central chandelier that speaks volumes about the restaurants intentions and unrepentant opulence.Championing the slogan "every table deserves a captain," a concept is inherently flawed by tableside shows preventing him from appropriate steering the backstaff flow of traffic, it was nearly forty-five minutes holding enormous menus close like blankets that passed before orders were finally taken, and somehow avoiding to topple unused wine glasses while reaching for a complimentary selection of antipasti the first bites of the meal would actually prove to be some of the best and most interesting, the acid-splashed cauliflower simple yet refreshing while cured meat alongside three breads were all quite delicious, the saucy focaccia particularly quite addictive.Breaking the menu down into four-courses, though presentations of five plates requiring a show saw things slightly more staggered, round one included nine baked clams in 3x3 preparation alongside two steaks of foie gras amidst onions plus sauteed peppers and although the former proved a bit unwieldy for sharing while the liver was unctuous and well portioned, all attention was drawn to the tableside preparation of ZZ's Caesar's, a $42 double-order highlighted by the buttery croutons and sardines that was otherwise quite standard.Taking macaroni recommendations from a Public Relations executive and adding in personal preferences plus the anecdotal experience of others, course two featured four different pastas along with seven off-menu meatballs, only the $150 White Truffle Tagliatelle proving appropriately cooked al dente as thinner noodles bordered on 'mushy,' the meatballs no better or worse than would be expected for six dollars each...and certainly not enough to compensate for the uni-tinged Julian's great flavor being marred by such a failure in execution.Onward to entrees, the Chicken Scarpariello suggested by a local Italian restauanteur undoubtedly performing the best of any savory as spicy sausage provided a decadent nest for the juicy half-bird, those enticed by the famous fried Veal Chop will be happy to know that the $64 tab is mostly justified by both size and virtually perfect execution, the same not to be said of a $75 loaf of lasagna far too heavy handed with green peppers beneath a top that was actually too bitter to be enjoyable as a result of being burned.Enjoying the company and conversation far more than the food as the clock inched toward ten it was finally with the dessert cart parked tableside that a concluding duo was selected and treated to fudgey Rainbow Cookies and complimentary Limoncello as we watched bananas flambeed tableside it was with good fortune that both the boozy fruit over ice cteam and curl of carrot cake succeeded where other plates had failed, each textbook in execution and large enough to share at comparative bargain of just fifteen dollars.** Admittedly early in its Las Vegas lifespan and no doubt a place that will drum up tourist dollars and praise from the press to whom prices and service are tilted to please, Carbone offers a unique dinning experience compared to anything else currently on The Strip, yet failing in several basics of execution from kitchen to captain it simply is not nearly as great as it currently seems to believe.
The Brass Tap - South End=Every time I come here, I sing Brass Monkey to myself the entire walk from my car to the door. And also sometimes in the bathroom. RIP MCA. I don't see how you can't like this place. Beer. Bottles and drafts. A ton of it. All of it. Changing taps with the seasons and what not. I mean, I got an adult root beer float. Do I really need to say anything else? That's right, Not Your Father's RB on draft the last two times I've been here. Warning: drink your float quickly or it will overflow. Don't like beer? They have cocktails and wine as well. Our good friend Billy M wanted two things for his birthday: dinner and great beer. So, we came here on a Thursday night. Nailed it. Our server was fantastic. We had people coming in and out joining us. He never skipped a beat. Seriously, if this guy isn't employee of the month then he's getting robbed. I ordered the prime rib sandwich with a side of mac n cheese. Note: the mac n cheese has bacon and green onions on top. Oh, and it's freaking delicious that way. Billy got a pizza with pretzel crust. Oh yes, pretzel crust. Our table also did pretzel bites, spin dip, bacon cheeseburger flatbread, an All American burger, and the buffalo chicken wrap. Another side item note: they have waffle fries. Everyone really liked their food. I devoured my entire sandwich, poor thing didn't stand a chance. There's a good amount of TVs for all your sporting needs. The patio is a pretty good size and they use heaters when it's cold. A ton of great specials throughout the week, including happy hour food specials. Two dollar tacos on Tuesdays. Boo-freaking-yah. Spoiler alert: they are really good. My favorite is the fist because I love peppadew peppers. You can get a couple tacos and a margarita for less than $10. Tuesdays are also game night, trivia on Wednesdays. Until next time Brass Tap, Brass Monkey, that funky Monkey. Brass Monkey junkie. That funky Monkey....
Sushi Hiroyoshi Japanese Cuisine=Get yourself to Sushi Hiroyoshi post-haste! This space has undergone a complete transformation since it's days as Sushi Yamaguchi- the formerly messy, cave-like space is now clean, open, and modern. Quality and service are stellar, and I place them on par with a lower-priced Kabuto. APPETIZER TRIO: Chef's choice of three different featured apps for the day. Ours were a tofu-uni dish, a seared tuna, and a cucumber-jellyfish salad, all of which were delicious. This first dish really set the tone for the beautiful presentation and careful balance of flavors we would experience throughout our meal.RED MISO: A comforting alternative to the usual (white) miso soup, with tofu and mushrooms.SCOTTISH SALMON TARTARE: Fresh fish, avocado, salmon roe, and spicy miso sauce, again with nice presentation. It may be helpful to ask for a spoon for this dish.NIGIRI: Super fresh. Go with any recommendations you receive. Had great masu, Hamachi, akami, ika, and (an especially amazing) hotate on our first visit. Everything was of great quality, and large thick pieces with lightly-vinegared perfectly-formed rice. TORO TAKU: Maki-style roll with fatty tuna, scallions, pickled daikon, and bonito flakes. Possibly our favorite item tried on our first visit. Simple but wonderful.UNA KYU: Maki-style roll with golden eel and cucumber. Savory and enjoyable.FLASH ROLL: One of the few somewhat-Americanized rolls on the menu, in five large pieces with salmon, tuna, yellowtail, avocado, and masago in soy paper. BF really enjoyed this.I can't fully express what a gem this place is. Space is small, seating a maximum of 30. Service is attentive and personable, even if seats at the bar aren't available. Fish freshness and quality was much higher than location led me to expect, with generous cuts and proper rice ratio. Dishes and quality were comparable to what we received on a recent trip to Kabuto, at half the price (though none of the grilled dishes). I live dangerously close to this spot and it will be hard to try new places with this spot right outside my backdoor.TIP: Lunch menu features a daily bento and sashimi combo, both exceptionally well-priced.
Cafe Agit=Korean food open late. My type of place! They serve bar food type dishes like wings and skewers in addition to more traditional dinners. We had the dduk kochi/rice cake in red pepper sauce, chicken gizzards, and spicy pork. The dduk kochi texture was superb, with a lightly crispy exterior to contrast with the soft chewy interior. The spicy pepper sauce was slightly too sweet for me but I loved the spicy kick from it. The chicken gizzards were... well, gizzards. The texture was very chewy but they were well seasoned and came with a side of hot sauce and sesame sauce. The spicy pork was tender and flavorful with mushroom, onion, and broccoli.Drinks were refilled as needed and we were checked up on frequently.The only annoyances were:1. No banchan offered prior to or with our meals.2. We were not given chopsticks but everyone else around us got them. Come on guys! Just because I'm speaking English to my husband doesn't mean I don't know how to use chopsticks!Overall though I'll be back again to try some more dishes.
Gen Korean BBQ House=Wish I didn't have to leave a rating because I do understand that it's their grand opening (aka they've only been open for a little while.) But unfortunately, I think it should be a soft opening since they didn't have a lot of items on the menu. My body was so ready to dine at a decent kbbq in Vegas since there are really none worth mentioning around here/worth the price lol.I was taken by surprise with the items that they had because they had Cajun fries!!!!!!!!! But of course, they didn't have it :-( They also didn't have gyoza, tofu, or any teas. Meats are ok, but to me... the Cali locations taste a lot better. I love love love the garlic pork belly, but for some reason it just had a weird after taste lol. Brisket was pretty dry as well, even when we tried to cook it medium. What I did like was that they serve Japchae in big portions!!!! My fav. The KFC Chicken was pretty good too, a little too saucy, but still good. The service is A1, they try their best. I've been to two of the locations in Cali & this one just disappointed me a little. But I hope the employees don't get discouraged because you are all doing the best you can & I see the hard work you all are putting in :-) Customers should understand that it's the grand opening and should be a little nicer to the workers for things they have no control of! I know this place will do well though because there aren't many kbbq places in Vegas and Gen is pretty well known. GG LV.A sight for sore eyes here in Henderson! (Especially for those SoCal peeps that crave KBBQ like I do sometimes)The recently opened Gen is at the Galleria at Sunset mall in Henderson. The restaurant is not attached to the mall however. It is located directly to the left of the main mall entrance. I have been long awaiting a good KBBQ joint since I moved to Vegas. And as luck would have it, it just opened in Henderson!I visited the second day of opening so things were still being kicked into gear with the staff and service so I can forgive some blips that we had like missed orders and the waitress dropping a glass of water on my friend. (ooops)The AYCE menu is extensive and very reasonably priced imo. $14.95 for lunch (open-3pm) and $19.95 (3pm-close)! Appetizers are included in the price as well. The lunch menu is the same as the dinner menu with a few 'premium' items left off. Of note, I really enjoyed the chadol (beef brisket), beef tongue, spicy rice cake, garlic pork belly and agedashi tofu! Granted, there wasn't anything I didn't like, but you get the idea. They were missing the pineapple steak from the menu, however. And I wasn't a huge fan of their side dishes :( There is no rice paper here but they do give you thin radish slices to wrap everything in!They also serve alcoholic beverages but I didn't indulge this time around. The parking is also plentiful in the mall lot. The decor is very swanky and modern which I enjoyed and there is greattttt ventilation (which my KBBQ veterans will know is very very important)It's a great addition to Henderson and Vegas and excited to have a place to satisfy my KBBQ/meat cravings now :OHow about a review written by a customer, and not a staff member? Don't believe me, check out Brian K's profile. Yelping since 2012, and two reviews? Also, his profile links to his Facebook, which shows he works at Gen Korean BBQ House.Enough about their gaming the system, to artificially inflate the ratings for this new Korean BBQ joint in Henderson. My wife and I were unsure where to go, as she is half Korean, we eat at a LOT of Korean BBQ places, in Vegas, and on the road. Galleria's newest food additions all look amazing from the outside, and this place was busy for a Monday night! The check-in process was great, you give a #, they text you your progress in queue. We were seated, and had the standard corporate greeting, "Is this your first time eating here with us? Oh, great, let me explain..." of course it is, you have only been open a couple days. Our server had minimal knowledge of the food, but brought out our drinks rather quickly. And then, a second person came to bring our drinks out. Overly efficient, or inept duplication?Our food was ordered, after being told there is a two hour time limit for the AYCE foods. The menu looked like there was a wide selection of options. Our first round of meats came out, and only two of them were right.So, they brought out 2x the drinks, and 50% wrong food to start. My wife ordered edamame, and was brought out a salad. When they delivered the meats, they gave my wife her boneless Kalbi rib type option, and put down some thinly sliced meat, and said it was spicy pork. They dropped off chicken and what they said was bulgogi to me.Spicy pork is coated in a red paste, but she gave it a try, just in case. It was beef bulgogi. When correcting it, they took the beef bulgogi, and brought out spicy pork. What they told me was bulgogi was pork. It took a while to get the right food brought out, after having our server tell me that beef turns white, depending on the marinade used. Ummmm. No. Pork turns white, beef turns brown, please try again. That got straightened out, thanks to a California trainer.  As to the flavor... the chicken bulgogi tasted like burnt soy sauce, and the beef bulgogi was just flavorless mush.After that... We only saw our server as he spent 20+ minutes chatting with a guy two tables over. Other tables around us were heard asking random employees, "Who is our server?!" We waited, and waited to pay. Finally, we just got up and went to the hostess. They aren't supposed to get our check for us, but did. Upon giving them a quick rundown of how our visit went, they got the GM. He is a very nice guy, who took our feedback, as a manager should, and said he would address the issue with his staff.I've waited a long time for a restaurant opening near Galleria / Sunset Station that I can really get excited about. Well, I'm finally excited.This is Gen Korean BBQ's 12th location, but they're a chain due to its success, not for being "chain restaurant" quality. This one is in the Galleria Mall building but not directly connected to the mall. It's near Red Robin and Larsen's, but it's at a higher elevation than Bravo.I actually ate for free (+tip) due to their public grand opening promo. It fell within dinner hours, which normally costs a very reasonable $19.95 for all you can eat (AYCE). The AYCE lunch is even more affordable at $14.95 and still includes everything except items #7, #8, and #10 (see below).This may be AYCE, but expect good-quality meats from the kitchen each time you order. Each table is allowed to up to 4 appetizers and 4 meats (8 total) per order. If you have 3-4 people in your group, go for it. But if you're solo or have one companion, don't do this! The time limit is two hours (not flaunted since the place wasn't packed), and you can order as often as you want, so order just a few dishes at a time so that everything is as fresh as possible. On a related note, don't cook all of your meats all at once if you're solo...Some AYCE KBBQ joints have an employee cook or at least start your order for you, but it's all up to you here, so get familiar with your brown and pink colors really quickly and pick up the tongs and scissors. There are small gas-powered grills no matter if the table seats 2 or 4, and my experience is that meats cook really quickly here. There's plenty of table space for plates even though the grill is prominently fixtured in the table's center, and they will change your grill cover often because "sticky" meat residues often coat the grill after a round of cooking.Time to talk about the food? I think so. The banchan (side dishes) were already at the table, and they included a rather sweet mashed potato salad, kimchi, spicy cucumber, spicy radish, and pickled cucumber. They all complement the meats well at some point, although the potato salad does seem out of place until you get really full. They also bring out a chopped lettuce salad with the first round of orders. The lettuce is fresh, but you can tell that they poured the sweet dressing onto the plated lettuce because a huge pool forms at the bottom.They have several appetizers, but the only must-order that I've had is the crispy squid legs, with their light crunchy batter and a good salty flavor. The KFC was a large portion of fried boneless chicken pieces with sweet and spicy sauce. I'd skip it in favor of proper meat texture here, which the sesame chicken does have. The seaweed salad and agedashi tofu are both pretty good. The popcorn shrimp and pork katsu are fun but not thematically consistent. The japchae is a good complement to any meat, but Gen's version seems a little harder and less silky than another delicious japchae that I recently ate across town.I got a bunch of grilled meats, listed as follows: #3 Gen chadol (beef brisket) is thinly sliced and comes in a relatively large portion. It's tasty and has the "beefiest" flavor.#5 Gen beef bulgogi also is largely portioned. It's nicely marinated and ends up tender after cooking, but it's a little messy to lay flat on the grill and flip. It's well worth it though.#7 Roast beef (premium beef chuck rib eye) comes in just 4-5 thin slices and cooks really, really quickly. Maybe 8 seconds at most on each side will suffice. The marbling really comes out in the great flavor and soft texture.#8 Premium beef tongue is around 5 rolled-up thin slices per order. Like the roast beef, it cooks really quickly. Another item with great flavor and tenderness, assuming no overcooking...#10 Gen yangyum galbisal, aka marinated premium steak, is about 5 squarish cuts per order. It's a boneless version of the popular short ribs. It was tender and well-flavored, and was a multiple reorder on my second visit.#15 Spicy pork bulgogi is also fine, and it's mild-medium at best. It's good but not special.#17 Smoked garlic pork belly and #19 Miso pork belly both come in two large, thick strips. Cut them up after cooking. The smoky flavor was a little unusual and perhaps should be left to the American BBQ context, but I enjoyed the miso version.#20 Shrimp and #21 Cajun Shrimp were both good, shell-on shrimp, 4 per order.The sweet dipping sauce and the salt and pepper mix are both useful for the non-marinated meats.Service issues seem to be a theme with new Gen openings, including the recent one in San Jose. Luckily, they were fairly minimal for me, with an average of 1.5 forgotten requests (all corrected after prompting). As I mentioned above, the restaurant wasn't full, so I didn't experience much slowness in order fulfillment.Overall, you'll find a delicious and worthwhile meal even at the regular price. I'll most likely be back soon for more meat gluttony.Tonight was my boyfriend and I's first time at Gen. We finally had a day off together for us to go on a date. To start off I went to the register to get a table, but when I went up the host and the two servers ignored me and proceeded with what they were doing. Fine, I understand it was busy, but they could have said "we will be with you in a moment", but they acknowledged me without saying a word. To keep this review somewhat short the waiter (he had a pony tail and glasses) forgot half of our order and we had to constantly remind him to bring our food. After we finished our first order we were ready to place another, but when we looked over the waiter was on his phone. We were left without food for a good 20 minutes, my boyfriend got so upset that he spoke with the assistant manager (Bryan); he did offer to only charge us for one person but when the check came he charged us for two. Apparently the sever was off, but he didn't let us know, and we had to order from the busser that was clueless on what the restaurant served. We also asked another server if they had a certain soup and he said "I don't know" and just walked away. Honestly if we didn't say anything I think we would have been left at our table without service and food. In the end my boyfriend had to ask for a refund since we basically didn't eat anything. I expected a lot from this restaurant since they are extremely popular in L.A.  Maybe I will give this place a chance again some day, but this restaurant is such a disappointment.This place blows - don't be fooled by the 4-5 star reviews given from the freebie promotion they ran during their grand opening phase.  Please ignore the people who proclaim this is the best AYCE or Korean BBQ they've ever had.  It's not even close to that -  I would say it's the worst in Vegas.  Pro's - cheap, 20 bucks, a lot of variety to choose from, and while you wait you can kill time in the mall and dl an app that shows you your place in line which is updated frequently Cons - oh boy.....Gimmicky and lacks any Korean culture/experience.  Waiters aren't knowledgable of food.  You can only order 4 orders of meet and they are TINY portions.   We must have placed a good 5-6 orders.  A plate of brisket will have 9-10 pieces.  Everything you pretty much have to ask for like sesame sauce, rice.  They don't offer rice paper or lettuce. The meats are average at most.  A few of the apps were frozen.  I could go on....Pretty much go anywhere else.  If you wanna save money then go to Hwaro which is the same price. Or pay 15 bucks more for dinner and get much better food at Lees.  Or pretty much go anywhere else but here.This place seriously sucks a55.Man don't believe the hype at all. Comparing this to their cali location they're worlds apart. Not saying that this is the worst kbbq in Vegas, but it's close to there. Do yourself a favor and don't waste any money here, there are much better kbbqs in Vegas.Ew moment of the week: Went to the toilet stall as a WORKER was coming out. Go in to find toilet seat down with pee drops all over it.... BRUHHH WTFFF?! YOU'RE SUPPOSE TO LIFT THE TOILET SEAT UP AND THEN PEE. As if that wasn't bad enough he didn't even flush!!!!! PLEASE MAN MERCY.I've been here three times with friends and family that wanted to try it out. And each time I've went here the same problem was always there.I find it off putting that their speech is always the same is "3 card max. split, 4 meat per order, leftover will be charged" I came here to eat ayce bbq and have a good time, not a speech of "here is what you can't do" in a semi threatening tone.Servers here are 0/5. They have a system where you don't have a dedicated server it's just a whole bunch of servers walking around. This creates the problem of zones specifically being left out. Many many times I saw tables next to me waiting forever to get an order in, when the other side of the room is swarming with severs dicking around. The servers seem to not have the intention of helping out too, they just walk around in circles and avoid areas waiting for their shift to be over. You really have to get their attention. Instead of them asking you if you need help with anything it's you that need to get their attention. It's very frustrating when you need a simple water refill or more potato salad.Echoing off many of the reviews here. You can only place 4 orders of meat....imagine coming in with a group more than 5... So limited!!!!! The portions are teri-freaking-bad too. So tiny!!!!!!!!!!Literally the only saving grace at the end was one server who kind of kept an eye out for us. Mizzo was his name! He made sure our orders we're coming through and apologized if it took a long time. This place has a lot to improve on before I make it a daily.Very good Korea BBQ at a very reasonable prices for both lunch and dinner. The only major drawback is the location, since it is located at the Galleria Mall (across the street from Sunset Station), which can be a rather long drive for anyone not working/living in this part of Las Vegas.Gen Korean Barbecue House has just opened 2 weeks ago. Still in their soft opening phase and running their promotion (free AYCE dinner for first 50 guests starting at 3pm). I actually have been here twice during this promotion (the second time I didn't know the promotion is still active and was guest number 39 of 50 on Sept 1, 2015). And my coworker that I was meeting also arrived and received the same promo voucher.There seems to be a lot servers/crew working on my first two visits. From what I have learned from casual interviews of the crew serving us, they have experienced managers and seasoned servers working here to train the new employees, so guest experiences can quickly improved to the level one can expect to received at their other established locations in California.  As is, the servers are all very friendly and tries to be as proactive about providing the best customer service as they can (almost never had to ask for beverage refills or grill change). I prefer to have regular cooking oil brushed on the new grill (only happened twice without prompting), or they would squeeze sesame oil (low smoke point so it would completely burn off before the grill gets hot enough to grill properly) afterwards. But when I requested regular cooking oil, they did fill a bottle from the kitchen to accommodate my request. I guess some of their other guests does not want the extra oil, so it is by request.Most guests that goes to this type of cook it yourself KBBQ knows and enjoy the interactive cooking experience. It is one of the best part of the meal in my opinion, but I am usual the designated grill master anyway. But if you can't cook or prefer the crew cook it for you, they will (but how well it turns out will vastly differ depending on their individual skills, as I doubt any of these kids have any formal culinary training). But seriously, it is not that hard to master once you learn to adjust the intensity of the flame while grilling your meats & seafood.They have most of your typical KBBQ meats, seafood and vegetables. But menu offering varies slightly by locations, if you have had previous dining experience at other Gen KBBQ locations. To minimize waste, you can order up to 4 meat dishes a la carte, which servers bring to you already portioned on plates. My favorite here is their No.10 Gen Yangyum Galbisal (Marinated Premium Steak), which I literally orders at least one each round. Their Chicken Bulgogi is excellent, but you really have to know how to grill these extra thick pieces of chicken without undercooking them or burning the outside or cooking it to its excessively dried unappetizing death. Cutting it to thinner slices on medium flame is recommended. The Beef Brisket & Beef Tongue is good and cooks super fast (unfortunately no half orders if you want less, like when you go by yourself). Their Pork Belly is basically thick slabs of bacon (options of plain, miso or red wine marinated). Shrimps are good and cooks relatively quickly, but your hands will get dirty peeling them afterwards (or bring your Bae that will peel it for you. The things people do for love).As far as appetizers, their salad is a must. Helps balance out the artery clogging yumminess of all the grilled meats. The Pork Cutlet is decent. The Fried Calamari is yum. Seaweed Salad is on par with sushi restaurants. KFC (Korean Fried Chicken) was disappointing, at least for me, since it really just reminds me of their variation on boneless Orange Chicken. Truffle Fries looks interesting (but it was not available on my first visit). Spicy Korean Rice Cake has a nice crispiness to it, but I recommend sauce on the side for this one.Even if AYCE is not worthwhile for you or you just don't feel like smashing your diet plans for half a week, they have Premium Box Lunch Specials ($7.95 to $9.95).As far as desserts. Currently they don't have anything, unless you count their Potato Salad (will already be at the table when the hostess seats you). But Macaron Ice Cream Sandwhich(es) will be available after their soft opening phase. Can't wait to try that.So if you are still with me after all those paragraphs, I  hope you find this review informative. Would I recommend it? Yes! Are there room for improvements? Of course, but they are already doing a bang up job so far and it should be even better in the months ahead. Price wise, it is very competitively priced. If they actually open a second Vegas location in a more centrally accessible venue, they will easily put major dents in their competitors gross sales and customer count.In closing, keep up the good job Gen KBBQ House & welcome to Las Vegas!*Use of iPad very helpful in checking orders.I really wanted to like this place since it's new and closer to my house, but I can't.  I went from happy face to sad face by the time I left. The interiors of this place is the best I've seen in a AYCE korean bbq place.  It's new, trendy, and clean.  The first half hour I have to say I was impressed.  The wait was short, and I received a text when my party was ready to be seated.  Party of 6, we were seated.  As soon as we got to the table, the side dishes were already there.  That was impressive.  Interiors and presentation was the highlight of the night, and it just went downhill from there.  There are rules to this place, which was somewhat understandable, but at the same time somewhat ridiculous.  They don't take Discover, for our party of 6 they can only separate 3 checks, and we can only order FOUR items at the time.  Let me repeat, for a party of 6, we could only order FOUR items at a time.  I can understand if there are only 2 people on the table, but with 6 people, 4 items are not going to cut it, and here's why:If the portions were bigger, 4 would be fine, but the portions are TINY.  Seriously, each item was probably shareable for 2 people.  Of all the AYCE korean bbq places I've been to, this place served the LEAST amount of meat for one item.  A plate of brisket is not going to satisfy 6 people.  We ordered 2 plates of the brisket, and that was fine.  Now if you were with a party of 2, you might leave satisfied with these silly rules, but I wouldn't recommend a big party if they're going to stick with four items for (let's say) 12 people.  It's going to run out quick, and you're just going to end up hollering at the servers for more more often.  What makes this place unique is there is no overhead hood system.  It's all under the table, so the fire in our grill kept burning out.  TWICE it happened.  TThey created what they thought was a solution by tilting the grill so the meat juices won't blow out the flame, but it just wasn't working when you're trying to cook your meat.  Twice the servers did this, and twice I had to take out the tong that kept the grill tilted so we could cook our food.  They really need to perfect this under the table hood system. I might give this place another chance if I come with just a friend or so, but I wouldn't recommend this place for parties.  I don't like how they don't take Discover...why not?Just not a fan of their rules, small portions, and their grill system.I came here with a group of six adults, two babies, and one toddler. We couldn't fit at one table so they split us up with two booths next to each other which is fine. The decor is very spacious, modern, sleek, and with the blue neon lighting throughout the restaurant, it has a trendy, loungey feel to it. They also had a big screen and they were showing college football. We came here right when they opened at 11 a.m. on a Sunday. Since this restaurant is new and popular, we didn't want to wait an hour. We turned out to be right because people started coming in and they got busy with people waiting.They charge the $19.99 dinner price for lunches on weekends. $14.99 for lunch on M-F. Dinner is $19.99 everyday. You can order four apps and meats at a time. The servings are small. Some people have complained about the portion size but I actually like it. That way, I can try more things and I tend to be a greedy KBBQ eater. I order too much sometimes. They were out of a few apps that day which I wanted to try. Out of the apps, I liked their sesame chicken the best. Their kimchi is really good too. I find that if I like the kimchi a restaurant serves, I usually end up liking the food as well.We ordered beef brisket, Cajun shrimp, galbisal, miso pork belly, beef tongue, chicken bulgogi, and beef short rib plate. We repeated some of the orders. I like the galbisal the best. I liked the seasoning on the Cajun shrimp but it was too much work peeling the shrimp. I rarely get chicken because it takes too long to cook and I'd rather eat red meat. We only ordered it because my friend's kid likes chicken. We received VIP service. Our waters were constantly refilled, our grills were changed 6-7 times, got more banchan, and the servers checked up on us often. The cons: no gyeran jjim (steamed egg), doenjang chigae (fermented soybean soup) and no dduk bo ssam (rice wrappers). Also, I'm not a fan of their grills. They don't have an overhead hood system. The grill burned too quickly and it needed to be constantly changed. However, you don't leave with that terrible KBBQ smell on you so I like that part.I haven't been to the CA location but looking at the pictures, their portions seem larger and they offer more items. I'll have to visit one of the CA locations to compare one of these days. Other than the lack of some KBBQ staples and the grill burning too quickly, it's a pretty good deal to satisfy your KBBQ fix. I felt so fat and satiated after. LOL.Having lunch with my girlfriend today. She said we should try out Gen. I hesitantly said Sure...Walking in, I already had a biased opinion formed due to my terrible experience at their TUSTIN location. I can't say I had a better experience this time around either. I understand this is a pretty new location but the kids all seemed young an inexperienced. They also need to step up their banchan portion game! This was also an issue at the Tustin location. I asked for extra kimchi. They bring the little thing with TWO pieces in it. TWO! I was like Oh gee. Can I have a BIG BOWL of kimchi please, perhaps with MORE than TWO pieces in it? Thaaaaanks! I mean, seriously. Wtf. Banchan + Korean BBQ go hand in hand! Especially kimchi! What the damn hell! Besides, the more I ask you for something, the more annoying it is for BOTH of us. I am an unhappy guest with no kimchi and you are an unhappy employee who had to keep going back and forth to bring me said kimchi! How bout just a niiiiice portion size to keep your guests satisfied??They have little banchan anyway, meaning not much variety, as well as TINY portions. They didn't have rice paper.They didn't automatically give you garlic and jalapeños. They do have appetizers you can order which is different and they also have some lunch box options which is nice too. That's about the only positive thing i can say. Oh and thank you RICHARD for changing our charred grill. Even tho we were pretty much done eating it was still nice of him! We only had the beef brisket, premium pork belly and spicy pork. It was all pretty MEH. The banchan was pretty mediocre as well. This is the third and LAST time I will ever waste my time, money, and calories at any GEN restaurant again!Yes, the first  Gen BBQ in Nevada. Arrived on a Wednesday evening. Located at the Galleria Mall, the entrance is on the exterior.I was solo and opted to sit at the bar which was completely empty since it was an early evening.  The entire staff here was really friendly and several of the employees transferred from So. Ca. to train new hires since they've only been open less then a month.  For those of you who aren't familiar with Gen they are a AYCE KBBQ.  Weekday lunch is $14.99 weekdays and evenings  and weekends are $19.99  The price includes salad and limited banchan but they offer additional appetizers for an extra cost each.I ordered the signiture steak, baby octopus, cajun shrimp, marinated beef, beef tongue, beef brisket and miso soup. Being solo, the portions were large and filling to the point that I was plenty  full although I wanted to check out the dessert menu. Unfortunately  they didn't offer desserts yet - because they're so new.After speaking  to the friendly manager from so Cal - he advised me there's several more Gen Bbq's coming to the Las Vegas area which will be convenient.I have not been this disappointed over a restaurant in a long time & it really sucks because I had my eye on Gen since they opened. I wanted to give them a month or so though. I understand the pressure on new businesses but today's visit was just totally insulting. Party of 9 for my cousins bday & they quoted an hour wait & they'll text once the table is ready. No problem, we totally understand it would be long. An hour later, we ask if it'll be any longer. "5 more minutes, just cleaning the table." This happened for another 45 mins. "10 more minutes, just cleaning the table." Nothing yet. Finally, we were informed that there are two booths available back to back, is that okay, they ask. Yes, but.. you're telling me that for 45 minutes, you weren't really cleaning the damn table?! You were just bluffing?! Oh hell no. We got to the table and there's a booth side by side. We asked if we could have that instead so we could interact with each other. She had to ask management if that's okay. It's common sense so it better be! Sigh..We were finally seated & got our orders in. Received our food and cooked them. Asked for the rice and they said it will be coming in 20 mins bc they ran out. Are you serious?! By the time the rice came, we already ate the food cause we were starving. We ordered some more and waited another 30 mins for those to eat with our already cold rice. Oh, and our waters only came 30 mins into our meal after asking them several times. That should've been the first things you give to customers. Patience was running thin at this point because every single server we encountered had the nastiest attitudes. No smiles, no eye contact, slamming plates on the table..(except for one guy who tried to compensate for his co-workers' actions but it was too late). Really felt they did not want to be there at all and we were nuisances for ordering. It's AYCE isn't it?! You make us wait so long so.. hell yeah, we're hungry hippos now! You can only split the check 3 times so we did. 3 different servers came by and kept asking how and it got old repeating what we were saying. We waited at our table for 30 more mins for our checks. We finally walked up to the counter and asked where our checks were. They said "Ummmmm.. Well...." Okay, got it.. This is how you want to end an already crappy dining experience. Good job. Walked out of there & heard 5 other parties complaining about their experience. So there, you've been warned. I usually give a 2nd chance for places but this place is not one of them. Cousin's bday ruined. Thanks Gen!There was a time I had given up on the KBBQ in Vegas. The quality was either terrible (Tofu Hut) or the price was just outrageous (Woonam Jung). But fear not, deer friends, Gen Korean Bbq house is on the prowl, looking to take advantage of the situation, hopefully, in order to execute the awesomeness of the situation, and finding that shining light, that wherever it takes us, we will find a way to succeed. I don't know what that last sentence was, I was on a roll. And sometimes, it's just hard for me to stop. Like the copper top. Who likes to drop. Bippity bop.Gen Korean comes by the way of California, a chain that has proven its popularity, particularly the Tustin location. This is also the only ayce kbbq in the Henderson area. I've heard the buzz and wanted to check out their stuff. I also heard it through the grapevine that they had something called 'rice paper'. I was like "Rice paper?!?". And then I left to try it out.For some of you who have trouble finding it, Gen is located on a new part of the Galleria Mall that had been built out. For some reason, I thought it was near like the Sauce restaurant and stuff. But it wasn't, it was connected to the mall. So look at the mall, and you should be able to see it. There is a sign. A big one. A very big one.Walking in, I liked the interior. It was modern, new, and fresh. But, it didn't feel too uptight or rigid. And you know I'm all about that. And then some. Picked out a boothy (boo), and started perusing the menu. One thing I noticed as I was about to order was that there were none of those huge air vents that are normally located above the grills on a kbbq table. Then I looked at the grill. Ermahgerd!They have the side vents that are located right next to the grills to suck up all that smoke! The only other place I saw this at was at Gyu-Kaku, and I thought that this was the greatest thing in the world. Right there Gen (Bennifer), you've got a big fan right ova' heah!Onto the food itself. There weren't a lot of misses, but of course there is on every menu, so I shall inform you. Popcorn skrimpy's. If you're expecting Taiwanese popcorn skrimps, you will be disappointed. These are more of the Chili's or Applebee varieties. Yeah, you know what I'm talking about. The other people I was with thought that all the other appetizers and sides were good though. And normally, my favorite thing to eat at a Kbbq is kalbi (marinated short ribs). I thought the ones here were OK. The meat quality is very good, but I felt as though the meat could have been marinated for a longer period of time. It tasted more like a steak. And steak is great. But kalbi... I need a bit more of that flava flav, catch my drift ;). And the skrimps (the ones you grill). I'll go on record by saying that I've never had good skrimps to grill on a kbbq in Vegas. That trend will most likely continue.Everything else was rock solid. The banchan is really good here. All the other meats that I've tried were excellente. Keep an eye on that #9, that beef short plate. T-ara was right about that one (I applaud you if you got that). One of the best meats I've had at a kbbq in a looong time. Surprisingly, their bulgogi (thin marinated sirloin) is probably the best in Vegas. Haven't had a good one in a while, and this one was really good. Probably a close second to the short plate. All the meats here are amazing and the grill is heated perfectly to cook them all. The service was good here. I've read the reviews and it looked like it would have been inconsistent, but it seems that Gen is constantly working on it, and for myself, it was probably one of the better services that I had at any kbbq in town. My drinks were always filled, and so were the banchan. They were also taking our orders quickly after we had finished our meats, so I was impressed.Gen is my go-to Kbbq in Vegas. This place has everything I'm looking for when I go out to one, and so far, stands head above the rest in town. Oh and Gen's famous rice paper. B to the omb.Intrigue and good company brought me in to Gen last night. The atmosphere is comfortable and trendy, the food selection is plentiful, and the staff members are very pleasant. However, the service is subpar, the quality of the food is nothing special, and the sanitary condition and cleanliness is questionable in parts of the restaurant that give pause to parts unseen. The confusion and disorganization however became a primary focus instead of enjoying the dining experience. I was really looking forward to coming to this restaurant, but I don't live in Henderson. I needed a reason to travel this way - and my friend's invitation was the motivating force. I was excited as I love cultural food varieties and the concept of a cook-it yourself Korean BBQ peeked my interest. Upon walking in to GEN, we were told our wait would be 30-minutes as they were quite busy. So, we headed over to the bar for our wait but became confused where to sit. It is an eating bar so grills are located between seats. I would have had no problem sitting down regardless of the grill plates, but the restaurant policy is obviously to presets the standard sides along the grill plates (e.g., spicy cucumbers, Korean potatoes salad, kimchi, meat dipping sauce & salt). I think having people stand around preset food is a little unsanitary. So, my stomach was slightly turning before ever sitting down to eat. Upon being seated, our assigned table also had preset seasonal sides at the table. This is truly a strange concept - I mean we are not talking about sealed condiments or salt & peppershakers. We are talking about open ramekins of food on tables in a busy restaurant with numerous people eating around these tables were preset food is placed. Not even the silverware in this restaurant is open to the elements - why the food?We first ordered some Gen appetizers to give us time to look over the meat selection on the menu. The Crispy Squid Legs were tough to eat. The Gyoza was very good. The Pork Cutlet was good but arrived lukewarm. About 10-minutes after we received the three appetizers another server tried to bring us another set of appetizers not realizing we already received our order. But, the atmosphere of confusion doesn't end here.Throughout the dinning experience we tried many selections of meat. We had the Gen Galbisal, Garlic Chicken, Gen Chadol, Pork Belly, Smoked Pork Belly, Gen Beef Bulgogi, Beef Tongue, Spicy Octopus, and Cajun Shrimp. There was really nothing that stood out as an amazing choice. Some of the meat had great flavor but most was bland that had to be dipped in the salt sauce provided. The garlic chicken came with a cheese like dip in a tin ramekin that had to be tossed on the grill plate so it could be made dippable. Food runners would drop off ordered meat selections and run as abruptly as they arrived. At times, we were confused about what had been delivered - and searching for someone to answer this question after it was dropped off was futile. The answers tended to feel more like  guesses. Some answers were blantantly not correct with what appeared to be staff feeling compelled to give an answer - any answer. For example when asked what the side selections were, I was told my romaine salad was the seaweed salad :) I know what seaweed salad looks like - so really? When I asked what meat selection was dropped off - beef tongue or Gen Chadol, I was told it was Gen Chadol. It was a different quantity than was previously ordered and it didn't taste quit the same,  so I used the menu pictures for comparison. Yup, I ate my friends beef tongue thinking it was my Chadol.The service staff appeared to be going in two directions at the same time - rather consistently. It was standard to wait long periods of time to have the grill plate replaced (or lit). Meanwhile, inhaling the burning smoke from food particles that fused to the stainless steal plate and produced a flowing, burning stream of smoke not caught by the under grill filtration system was uncomfortable. It really ruined the mediocre experience! Cooking the meats on the grill was easier when oil was put on the grill plates because the plates are super hot and the meat instantly sticks. Some wait staff would bring oil when changing the plates and others would not. Often times by the time you realize THIS server didn't bring oil, and didn't ask if any was desired, he was off and running. If you were lucky enough to catch a waiter to ask for oil the wait was usually 5-10 minutes. Additionally, not one server could tell me what kind of oil they were using on the grill plates. Lastly, there is a garbage and plate collection station outside of the restroom area. It is an unsightly, gross scene.  I can't stand to see dirty dish stations. That is something that should be in the back of a restaurant. I am not sure the flow of this restaurant was considered before the opening.My Mango-Tini was really good! -  In the end, I won't be in a hurry to return.Went on Sunday 11-8-15 with my friend Jamie P.  I don't know what I can add that the 500+ people before me have not said, other than they seem to have worked out the service issues that they had in the beginning.  I've only been to Korean bbq one other time at Shilla BBQ here in Vegas, and it closed down.  It was really gross and dirty so with that being my only experience to compare it to, this place was very good to me.  I got the AYCE menu and a coke and my total was $28.47 with tax and tip.  I didn't realize that dinner prices apply all day on Saturday and Sunday.  ___________\\\\Things I liked://// -The waitress did not get judge-y when we ordered a ton of stuff. -The meat was super fresh. -The salad was really tasty. -Their rice was really good and sticky. -Server was very attentive and brought refills and asked if we wanted more meat. -Food came out really quickly.-Huge variety of meats.  -The decor is beautiful.  -The baby octopus are HUGE.  I was expecting the tiny ones like some chinese buffets have but these were like the size of my hand.  -Spicy rice cakes are wonderful.  I like them grilled. ___________\\\\Things I didn't like:////-There was a huge spiderweb in the corner.  Didn't this place just open? -The potato salad was gross.  Imagine cold mashed potatoes with pickles in it. Blech.  -We had to ask for rice.  -Banchan was sitting on all the tables prior to seating people.  I found that pretty gross.  What if flies landed on it, or worse, some kid comes by and sneezes on it??  Ewww.  -I asked for rice paper and was brought some chewed up sheets that wouldn't even stay together.  I think they were old or something. -No macaron ice cream sandwiches like the other GEN locations.  BOO!!!-They were out of french fries and mac & cheese.  (like the only 2 things for kids)Been here twice to eat, for the sole reason that it's close to home.Definitely not a fan because of the horrible service.Wait times are ridiculous and the staff seems to be all over the place.Nobody knows their roles or what to do in general.Food is eh.. You get what you pay for with the price. Quality is just not there for me and some of the meats have a weird, pungent smell to them -- noticeable in the porks. They also don't serve steamed egg, no big deal but what a turn off. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯I rather make the 30-40 minute drive all the way to Chinatown and be satisfied with a legit KBBQ restaurant, not a wanna-be.A little over a year ago I worked in this mall parking lot when it was a fenced off construction site, and a few months ago this place opened. I have been wanting to come here from Day 1 with all the "reviews" that became controversial debate in Yelp Talk. I was unsuccessful asking several Yelp Friends to lunch here as schedules never resulted. So on Saturday night 11/7th I took the drive to Galleria Mall with my closest best friend in hopes of a long awaited fantastic Korean BBQ experience.Parking was convenient directly out front, on the Sunset Road (south) side of the Galleria Mall, in the newly surfaced parking lot. Gen KBBQ has a modern looking, upscale exterior w/ beautiful entry.We walked in and were immediately greeted by a friendly hostess. She said it would be a 50 minute wait for a table for 2 or we could sit at the bar. We requested to sit at the bar enjoying drinks while awaiting our table. She led us over to the bar and introduced us to the friendly bartender. We became immediately confused as there was no place to sit without prepared appetizers resting on the bar. The hostess and the bartender shared 1 of those looks like 'we don't get people that have drinks at the bar, just dining patrons' but after a long minute of concluding a gameplan to accommodate us, by moving the foods from the bartop, we were seated at the bar. This was becoming an an odd experience. I left to the men's room and she ordered a drink. When I returned a few minutes later, the hostess came up to us and said our table was ready. I wish that kinda "50 minutes" would go that fast at DMV!We were seated in the corner at a nice table for 2 to experience our 1st KBBQ dining experience. The server explained all of the side dishes that were prepared and already waiting on our table. I don't know about you, but I did question how long the side dishes have been sitting at our dining table and previously at the bar. Answer: "Not that long!" Hmmm....We ordered 2 AYCE dinners @ $19.95 each and tried the Pork cutlet-average, Gyoza-good, Squid legs-average, Galbisal-average, Garlic chicken-average, Chadol-average, Pork belly-average, Beef bulgogi-good, Smoked pork belly-good, Beef tongue-average, Cajun shrimp fully encased w/ shell/head/eyes-frustrating to peel, Spicy octopus-very good! Overall, the food tasted flavorless most likely from sitting in marinades too long and/or perhaps not cooking long enough or cooking too long.Our server multiplied into 4 different servers within the 1 hour we dined + 2 others that would perform grill changes. A total of 6 different employees that still resulted in a lack of personability that made us guests feel like cattle being shuffled in/out for the next guest. Not what we expected from an upscale looking place, but w/ the low price..."Don't judge a book by its cover."2 of the 4 servers recommended grill oil, 2 of them said no oil. Not 1 of the 4 servers knew how long to cook each of our selected raw foods. My friend and I both enjoy gourmet cooking and know oil is easier to cook food. But regardless of oil or not...several grill changes were required, plenty of burning residue w/ smelly smoke that became annoying resulting in me having to get up and find somebody to change out the empty smoky grill, no overhead exhaust system, and a flame outage were the highlights of our dinner in this very trendy and modern Gen KBBQ @ Galleria Mall. I think the owners should instruct management to hold regular meetings w/ all employees discussing restaurant procedures, how to work effectively as a team, customer service issues, food sanitation & preparation to ensure a Grade A by SNHD, familiarity of the foods in general including recommended cooking times for safety and best taste, and invest in better grills w/ exhaust systems, and a bar to accommodate guests awaiting a table so they can comfortably enjoy a drink. With all the traffic this place gets due to the low AYCE price, it will be just a matter of time before ???. Hopefully this brand new restaurant serving raw foods get their act together quickly. She enjoyed her drink, Mango-Tini :-)See 10 photos below...YELP 300 CHALLENGE 2015: #271Whatever you do- DO NOT PUT YOUR JAP CHAE GLASS NOODLES AND VEGGIES ON THE GRILL! My friends and I couldn't tell if the noodles were raw, and since everything else was, we grilled them. Our waiter could not stop laughing at and teasing us! It was hilarious, stupid and embarrassing but a great time! Any how-this place was awesome. My friends and I felt it was too cool for the Galleria Mall; it really seemed like a District or Town Square-y joint. Very atmospheric, modernized intimate dining on the second floor of the mall. We also had a 20 minute wait so we left and wandered the mall until they texted me they were ready, which was super convenient.The whole experience from the moment we sat down to the time we finally left was awesome, super fun and just a great time. The meats were all delicious and it was really fun to cook and season your own food and sample the tables' creations.  I think my favorite thing was the squid bulgogi. It was hilarious watching the little white blob curl and quiver on the grill and it tasted absolutely delicious. The jap chae, glass noodles and veggies, was also really yummy, double cooked or not. I wanted to order another serving just to double grill as a joke but my friends are better at being decent adults and convinced me not to. The other fav was the soju; we got pomegranate lychee (you can mix flavors) and it was so delicious that two of us downed a pitcher in about 30 minutes. All in all, if you're thinking about stopping by or want to try something new and are in the mood for all you can eat, do not pass this place up! It is so amazing and worth every dime!Geez, 600+ reviews?!  Many of these reviews lack merit, but... True fact: A LOT of people do come here. It is very busy all the time. Even on this unassuming Tuesday evening.  Friends that I know are not Yelpers are repeat customers.Pro-tip: Be smart about the time you come or be prepared to wait. I have never waited more than 15-20 minutes the two times I've been here.  Arriving Tuesday at 6:40 PM. Seated at 7:00 PM. Dined 7:00-9:00.  I could see the hangry folks waiting from my table. The waiting area was packed from 7:00-9:00. Meaning diners like myself ate for 2 hours. No table turnover. Duh. So come early or come really late. You're welcome.#1 - Gen signature steak - Want to feel like a pro chef? Season that baby with the salt and pepper from the little dipping dish. Bam!#3 - Gen chadol - thinly sliced brisket. Get this. Like at least two times. It cooks very fast!#5 - Gen beef bulgogi - thinly sliced, marinated sweet and savory. We got this twice. It comes with onions, get those on the grill too!#8 - Beef tongue - Not bad!#10 - Gen yangyum galbisal - marinated premium steak. Pretty good!#15 - Spicy pork bulgogi - Great flavor! Not too spicy.(In general, not a chicken fan when it comes to KBBQ)Pork belly options: #17 - Smoked garlic pork belly - Least favorite. Garlic flavor was weak.#18 - Red wine pork belly - Yummy! You can really taste the red wine. #19 - Miso pork belly - Yummy! Very tasty!Seafood options? Too full to consider, but we did try the #22 garlic calamari and it was okay.Other food items:- Salad - Very good and fresh tasting- KFC (Korean Fried Chicken) - A bit sad. Not my favorite.- Tofu appetizer - Looks nothing like the photo on menu. Grossly heavy breading. Skip. - Gyoza - Not mind blowing in any way. We got three times though. The kiddos enjoyed the crunchy treat.- White rice - Needs a lot of improvement. For an Asian establishment, do not serve hard rice okay?- Jap chae - 2 orders were sufficient for 5 adults. Not bad, not the best.- Rice paper - not available. Boo!- Radish paper - pretty good actually.- Spicy tofu soup - It was okay. Did not taste "authentic." Did I enjoy my meal? Yes.Would I come again? Yes.This really is a generous 4, considering some flaws with customer service. I liked the food, so I'm not complaining.
Fruits and Roots=I've visited this spot again and have experienced great customer service. They have bubbly and knowledgeable staff. The owner was in contact with me after my first review and she's been pretty outstanding. She truly cares to provide everyone with an exceptional experience and encouraged me to visit them again. That's really awesome. If you're on the go like I am, they have a drive-thru where you can get your healthy grub and hit the road with a fresh juice, wellness shot or latte in hand.  I read another review stating they had espresso and swung by here to get my morning caffeine fix. The drive-thru option is great and I really enjoyed my iced vanilla latte with cashew milk and espresso. Yes, they have cashew milk as an option and I love it!  I will always order almond, coconut or cashew if they have dairy alternatives. The latte was super refreshing.  It wasn't full of junk and it was lightly sweetened with agave. It's bit pricier than your typical Starbucks (rightly so).  You're going to pay a small premium for quality and I'm totally fine with that. I will pay more for the wholesome ingredients when I'm cutting out the junk.  I loved my latte and will be back to treat-myself again.  I will have to try a lunch here in the near future. Go ahead, treat-yo self to some healthy goodness. They easily accessible and may be found off the 215 and Buffalo in the Southwest.
Pub Lord William=Pretty cool new pub with a beautiful patio.  Decent choice of drinks and bloody caesars that are not bad at all, I went for the Big Willy that comes with a candied bacon. The bacon was so good that I had to order a second caesar. The food menu has some good things to offer. Poutine is just OK, although one of my friends was really happy with the french fries and the gravy was nice, the cheese curds really melted and I strongly believe they should be crunchy. My seasonal salad was beatiful, made with red, yellow and brown tomatoes, which were so tasty as they have been just picked from the garden. You gotta try the home made chips, the perfect snack for your bloody caesar!The pub inside is spacious, kind of industrial set up, but it feels comfy. We had a blast in the bathrooms, they all have black board walls and little bucket full of chalk pieces. The walls invite you to write something and we, the well grown kids, wrote for the first time in our life on the walls of a bathroom. Now I have to come back to take a picture of the bloody caesar, as I forgot to do it yesterday and may be make another statement on the walls.......
Pizza Forte=Pizza Forte opened just over a week ago in a small spot in the Hard Rock Hotel.  Owned by Mimmo Ferraro, It's obvious that their forte is pizza--New York Style sold by the slice or one can order a custom 14" or 18" pizza.  They also sell hot dogs, meatballs, and cannoli, filled when ordered and not pre-filled like most places.Four of us had dinner at Ferraro's Italian across Paradise from the Hard Rock and after stuffing ourselves silly there, we decided to walk over to the HRH and try the new pizza place.Not being a large consumer of pizza, I do know good pizza when I have it.  I've had enough life experience in New York and Las Vegas to have tried a lot of different pizzas.I had a slice with sausage and pepperoni.  The toppings were just the right amount, the cheese was quite good, and the crust was browned just right.  I somewhat folded the large slice and scarfed it down in a short time.   Excellent!  While I usually don't get NY style pizza often, I know that they're doing a great product.The dining room is shaped like a small L.  Entering from the casino, you walk past some tables here and there and reach the counter with a large Order Here sign and you can see the pre-made pies under heat lamps.  Then pay at the cashier and you're all set to try some of  the best pizza in Las Vegas.If Pizza Forte was closer to where I lived, I'd be there more often.  At it is, the few times I'm at the Hard Rock, this is a very enticing option for quick, solid food.
The Madison Blind=We ordered the cheese curds, crispy shrimp, steak tacos, and the venison meatballs.All were great but the cheese curds and venison meatballs were my favorite.We also had the Mendota martini and the Pancho villa- both also very very good. If I had to pick a fave, it'd be the Pancho villa- very flavorful.Madison had a huge need for another rooftop bar/restaurant. Thankfully, the Graduate Hotel delivered.The Madison Blind is 5/5 for ambiance, food and service.From the roof you can see state street, the Capitol building and Lake Mendota. It's beautiful. But when winter inevitably comes, you'll be just as happy sitting inside with the modern decor and large windows.The menu is diverse and affordable. We really liked the cheese curds, profiterole ice cream sandwich, cheese plate and steak tacos. Very shareable. The cocktails also rock, I highly recommend the martini with gin and cucumber!Service was friendly and accommodating. The cherry on top of a great experience.We will be back for appetizers and drinks, dinner or maybe even a night out! I really hope this becomes a bar to throw into the rotation.
Naf Naf Grill=My husband is obsessed with Naf Naf, as he frequently works in Chicago. He was thrilled when one opened in Madison and we were excited to try it the first week they were open.  I have eaten Naf Naf a few other times, and the quality of the food at the new Madison location was the same tasty food I have grown to enjoy in Chicago. I always get the falafel pita with cucumber salad, onions, and garlic sauce. I was surprised to see another review complaining about the pita, because honestly, the pita is probably my favorite part of the meal. It is so soft and warm and tasty and...I kind of want one right now!! My husband's standard order is the chicken shawarma pita and an order of his beloved fries. The guys working behind the counter when I was there were super informative and friendly. I asked a few questions and they answered everything with smiles on their faces!I have two complaints about the Naf Naf on State Street. The first is trivial, but annoying enough I feel I need to mention it - the decor is seriously lacking. I totally get that Naf Naf is a chain and they all look the same, but they look boring.  State Street is a fun place with a fun vibe, and I kind of just felt like I was eating in a cafeteria. It was just so sterile and boring. I highly doubt there is anything that can be done about the decor, but man, if I were in charge, I would sure try.  The more significant complaint I have is one that has been mentioned in other reviews - the overall amount of food that you get for your money is a little disappointing.  Again, my husband has eaten at every Naf Naf in the Chicagoland area, (and I have eaten at their downtown location) and  every time the pitas come overflowing with so much goodness that they are almost difficult to eat. The Madison location gave me a pita that was only about 2/3 full with a ton of extra pita at the top. I love the pita, so I didn't mind eating it plain, however, it really felt like they were skimping out. I know we will be back to Naf Naf many times to appease my husband's cravings, and I hope that they increase their portions so that patrons feel like they are getting their money's worth!
Barnacles & Bones="I'm so hungry!"So moaned Kip as we made our way home, him from a busy Saturday shift at the pub where he works, and me from meeting my mum in town. Aha, I remembered, we'd be passing that new street food police box that Blythe reviewed earlier today, let's stop by and try it.Cue, the best decision I made all weekend.Having had a busy day, what with the Tram Stop Market, the lovely chap who runs B&B had run out of slaw, so gave us a discount on our meals. Totally unnecessary, but very welcome nonetheless. As we were going to be walking and eating (no mean feat) we both opted for rolls - mine with beef, Kip's with crab.  The beef was slow-cooked short rib in a sherry gravy, umm, amazing! Tender and delicious, the roll (from Manna House) soaked up the juices wonderfully providing an entirely enjoyable experience with every bite. The crab comes in a home-made lemon mayonnaise, and Kip declared it better than the beef (I wouldn't agree, they were both excellent and I preferred the warm temperature of the beef to the cold crab).B&B had proved to be so good we stopped by again on Sunday - this time I had crab on 'tarragon salted chips' and Kip had crab with quinoa salad.  Again, he was certain his meal was better (it was very nice) but I'm a sucker for chips and these were perfect, yellow, crispy chips made in their little deep-fat fryer to order.Mr B&B told us he's got the lease for 12 months, so please do pop by and try! There's a couple of great sounding brunch options which I'm keen to try.  In fact I want to go back again today, but I suspect 3 days in a row might be a bit excessive. Oh, and of course now I've made myself really hungry. Mmmm crab and chips...
CRAFTkitchen=You can do a lot worse on your half-day off than checking out this place.I ended my day early today due to some sort of "Nevada Day" nonsense, so I decided to try the latest hot spot down the street because they close at 3pm daily (and open at 7am, but I'm no morning person). This place is CRAFTkitchen, a brand-new cafe and bakery in Henderson that has taken over the space vacated by Bread and Butter. Judging from the pre-review Yelper buzz, I thought that there might be something to it.Seating is available outside in a dedicated space that's walled off by pallets-turned-flower-pots, although the window of opportunity to enjoy it is already closing. I sat inside instead, enjoying the semi-industrial yet warm and welcoming decor, not to mention the awesome pillow for my back.Noting that more popular pastries such as chocolate eclairs and almond croissants had already vanished, I decided to start with the kouign amann fruit ($3.25), one of the pastries still available at the counter. I hadn't enjoyed a kouign amann since 346 Patisserie closed, so the opportunity was too tempting to pass up. Although I accepted the server to get the pastry heated up, it was only warm on the outside. The fruit filling was cool to the touch, which I had no issue with, and it was a fresh, welcome addition. The interior of the kouign amann was delicious and flaky as expected, but the outside wasn't as crispy as I would've liked, and it also suffered from having these hard chewy bits, likely from hardened syrup. I'd still order it again as-is, but it could use some tweaks.Several minutes after I'd finished the pastry, my server asked me to repeat my entree order, which I did. I asked whether it had been started yet, to which he apologetically replied no. Whether he's living up to his given name of "Rusty" or he's still getting up to speed, I would have been upset if I'd been in a hurry. As it was, I just settled on waiting for what I hoped would be some great food.Finally, the "Chicken & What?" ($11.75) arrived. Excuse the cliche, but it was well worth the wait. Perfect pillowy buttermilk waffles and almost-impossibly tender chicken were adorned with julienne pickled jalapeño and a pickled jalapeño maple syrup that brought just enough heat to the party. It's one of the few occasions where I've been thankful for my specific sensitivity to spicy food. Everything in the dish worked aside from the small portion (bordering on "shareable") and the imperfect exterior. There were some bits that had the right golden brown crunch, but a lot of the breading was moist and light, which is not a positive in this context.Although I am not head over heels just yet, I'm already looking forward to the next opportunity to try more of CRAFTkitchen's breakfast/lunch menus and pastries. They have a lot of potential and although they're pretty much on the opposite side of Henderson from my home, I can't help but agree that they're already living up to their motto of "local. inspired. eats."(UPDATE 12/10/15: Smashed avocado toast ($11.50) was true food porn with the runny yolk on the poached egg. With the sunflower seed pesto, extra seeds, and micro greens, great flavors overall. Short rib hash ($15.95) was also very enjoyable, with surprisingly sufficient salt levels and really strong potato work. Pecan sticky bun ($3.25), comped by owner due to long wait times, was thoroughly delightful. Kouign amann w/o fruit ($3) seemed a little more crispy than last time, with otherwise similar flavors and textures.But I still noticed the inconsistent breading on my friend's "Chicken & What?" in addition to some unexpected darker-than-golden-brown color on the waffles. Please execute this one better.)Open a week and already inundated with Yelp check-ins and photos! Dragged myself across town to check it out and was pleasantly surprised: the patio and pallet-planters full of fresh greenery and herbs are bright and inviting. The menu has a focus on freshness, with some healthy-sounding dishes and a lot of indulgent options, and also some pastries and sweets on display. The food-related quotes stenciled on the wall are a fun bit of whimsy, too.Opted for the avocado toast ($12), described as sliced ciabatta topped with a generous amount of mashed avocado (easily more than one whole avocado), topped with microgreens, sunflower seed pesto (nice texture!), and flaked sea salt- along with "poached eggs". I received a single egg, and it was overcooked. Like I said though, they just opened so I'll give them time to perfect that. But when I come back it better be perfect, because as-is I thought it was already pretty great.Service was interesting. There's a pastry case and a large posted menu, but if you're dining in  you receive a dedicated server for table service. Seems more like a "walk up and order, then seat yourself" kind of place. I would have brought the overdone-egg issue to my server's attention, but I was starving and even though I left it til last on my plate, I was not checked on until I was ready for my check. I'm rarely on this side of town, but the menu is fresh, fun, and fairly creative- there are kinks to work out in both product and service, but I look forward to visiting again and seeing improvements in a couple of months. Perhaps next time I"ll try a kouign amann, though I prefer mine sans the fruit it is currently displayed with here.Items Selected:Brewed to Order Coffee from Colorado River Coffee RoastersKouign Amann with Housemade Mixed Berry JamAlmond CroissantGluten Free Pumpkin MuffinPecan Sticky BunOatmeal BruleePear & Pomegranate & BurrataRed Velvet CakesChicken and What?Chorizo Shepherd's PiePulled Turkey BennyShort Rib HashCroque Monsieur PaniniOatmeal CookieChocolate Chip CookieGluten Free Chocolate BrownieApple TartRed Velvet CupcakeCarrot BarGreen Apple, Chocolate, Pumpkin MacaronOwned and operated by Jaret Blinn, a California native whose long history in Las Vegas has gone overlooked by many due to his time in corporate kitchens including work with Bradley Manchester at Red Rock, Henderson's new craftKITCHEN stands to raise the curtain on the skills of another Chef who gave up a steady paycheck in favor of something more personal, a breakfast and lunch space offering "Local. Inspired. Eats."Part passion project, but also a choice made to assure more flexibility for a man with a wife and kids, craftKITCHEN fills a strip mall spot reimagined from a previous restaurant and with clean lines plus a subtle natural vibe imparted by cooking quotes and plantlife the experience starts with warm welcomes at the door, a 7 o'clock arrival finding the youthful team still stocking shelves as light tunes from local radio chimed overhead.Immediately attuned to no less than two-dozen pastries, each crafted by Jaret starting at 2am with baking extending late into the day, it was admittedly having e-mailed to discuss the concept as well as the possibility of a 'small plates' sort of tasting that my arrival was expected, and although the Chef admitted some fatigue following a late night Grand Opening with friends and family neither he nor his staff could have been more accommodating, a total of eight demi-portions sampled with rarely a miss in quality or execution.Taking time to do things right, everything from produce to coffee sourced as locally as one can, those who love the later will be happy to know beans are sourced from Colorado River Roasters and with each cup brewed to order the fruit flavors are robust with a smooth finish, each sip good on its own though all thebetter when paired to breakfast pastries offered warmed-to-order, each of four sampled far less sweet than others in the area with the moist pumpkin muffin particularly impressive while the kouign amann was slightly softened as a result of housemade mixed berry filling.Allowed to select the menu, but taking input from the team as to which items were best, plates were rolled out mostly in pairs from the kitchen and starting light with well-timed progression round one consisted of a well-composed salad featuring creamy burrata set against pomegranate with an alternative plate as delicious as it was different, the toothsome oats perfectly cooked beneath a crackling caramelized top with an optional mix-in of dried fruit and nuts.Again showing the palate of a chef willing to present his sweeter side with nuance as opposed to a sledgehammer of sugar, it was in silver-dollar flapjacks tinged in cocoa that tastebuds were next entrusted and, although better than the majority, the omnipresent plate seemed a bit too 'safe' to be worth too much stomach space, particularly when compared to juicy fried chicken atop crisp waffles kicked up by pickled peppers, let alone a Shepherd's Pie replacing lamb with spicy chorizo that you won't find anywhere else in town.Not entirely sold on avocado toast, but willing to trust the chef that the ingredient was put to equally good use on the pulled turkey benedict, those looking for something 'different' would be well served to check out the brined breast atop an English muffin with a sidecar of lemony hollandaise while a taste even more savory can be sought in the short rib hash with pan seared spuds, peppers, and onions.Overestimating my hunger when presenting the meal's final savory, a whole ham and cheese sandwich with creamy Bechamel pressed between slices of housemade panini bread, the somewhat atypical croque was nonetheless every bit as good as the sum of its ingredients and taking half home along with a box of baked goods it was approximately six hours later when the tasting continued, the oatmeal cookie with fruits similar to that of the bruleed version a particular standout as was the fluffy gluten-free brownie, apple tart, and carrot bar that ratcheted up the experience with tangy cream cheese frosting anchoring candy 'leaves' and buttery toffee shards.*****One-upping eat. in ingredient quality and out-thinking MTO Cafe in terms of creativity and menu design it would be difficult to name anyone outside of publicUS offering such a bounty of great products seven days a week throughout breakfast and lunch, the 25-minute drive from Summerlin notwithstanding there is no doubt craftKITCHEN is well worth a look for locals and tourists with a car alike.The second time is even better. While living in Southern California I took for granted all the great things that were within walking distance; grocery stores, parks, watering holes, and amazing brunch spots. Craft Kitchen looks and feels like it was plucked right out a San Diego or Santa Monica Beach community; very clean, modern look, and I can walk there!I've come here twice now (brunch & lunch) and both meals were amazingly tasty and the service was on point. The first time here I ordered the Smashed Avocado Toast and enjoyed it on the "craftily made" outdoor patio. This light and filling lunch is comprised of Ciabatta, sunflower seed pesto, micro greens, and a poached egg. The perfect option for the eater looking to watch calories and is an avid avocado fan. Eggs, avocados, and crispy bread, what's not to love?  Visit number two: Short Rib Hash. My first thought is, this place is basically a coffee shop with a slightly refined menu, do they really have the balls to put out a Short Rib option? Yes, and they can back it up. The Short Rib melted in my mouth, it was tender, flavorful with just the right amount of salt, I was very impressed that Craft Kitchen could pull this dish off. The poached egg broke perfectly when cut into and the smashed finger length potatoes had a perfectly crispy skin with a soft buttery inside.I know Henderson is far from the walking communities of SoCal, but Craft Kitchen is a start to something worth traveling for.P.S. - Get the Pecan topped sticky bun. Trust me.Well, that is how breakfast is done. There isn't much that will get me to drive across town but after hearing all the rave reviews of CRAFTKitchen and seeing all the pictures of gorgeous food I had to give them a try for myself.They were packed on the Saturday morning after Thanksgiving and my mom and I patiently waited for a seat while ogling the delicious looking pastries in the display case.Finally seated it took me a minute to decide what I wanted to order. Everything sounded amazing and as I unabashedly stared at the food from neighboring tables the decision process became that much harder. I finally settled on the short rib hash, while my mom ordered the smoked salmon on a pretzel roll. I also ordered a pecan roll to share. The pastry came out first and it was perfection. I recommend having it heated to maximize the ooey gooey factor. We devoured this in about eight seconds flat. Next, our entrees arrived and they we're everything my heart was hoping for and more. The short rib hash was evenly flavored and the crispiness of the potatoes complemented the subtly sweet flavors of the meat. I loved every bite of this dish. The smoked salmon was excellent as well. The pretzel bread was soft and pillowy and enhanced the flavors of the salmon and cream cheese well. I can't rave about this place enough and I look forward to returning soon and often.
A Taste of Buffalo=This place is legitimate for back East neighborhood dinning.  Maybe the help is a little too nice to call it authentic (eg they are very friendly).  I ordered at the counter and they recommend the onion rings.  Wow, the rings were great.  Obviously made fresh on site.The wings were high quality with the standard sauce choices, if you like wings you will be happy.  I also did a half Phily cheesesteak.  It was a big portion and tasted great.  The bread was fresh, soft in the middle and crunchy outside, the meat had enough juice to soak into the bread and the whole thing was buried in melted cheese.  Perfect casual dining for the Everyman.
Artisanal Foods Cafe=My love affair with Artisanal Foods just got deeper - because now there is a cafe. Like the grocery store portion, the cafe offers a heavily curated food menu, focusing on foods they carry in the store. For example, one of the things we tried today was an elegant grilled-cheese on brioche, which was accented with one of the honeys they carry. (Honey and grilled cheese are delicious, I learned.) The pots de creme for dessert featured the Askinosie Chocolate they sell. The lionfish was the most-stunning dish we tried, although a little unfair to compare to delicious Mary's pasture-raised organic chicken. Apparently they sell fresh lionfish, or will soon. It was so hard to choose from menu we had six different dishes plus dessert - for lunch for two. (Portions are small, however.)The cafe is helmed by Brett Ottolenghi, along with chef Johnny Church, both of whom stopped by our table to greet us and ask what we thought. I like that. They also are running a catering business - the cafe is the "downtime" from catering. This is not the place to bring your aunt who thinks dinner at Chili's is a real treat. This is the place to bring your friend who imports her own caviar.Incredible. Artisan Foods has outdone themselves! I dig the concept: selling specialty ingredients for home cooking, and showcasing store products at an on-site café! Menu is limited, but everything we tried was great. This is definitely a spot to make reservations, as seats are limited. Come hungry and bring a couple of friends- I wish I'd had an extra person or two with me to order the entire menu to share!JELLYFISH "CALAMARI" FRIES WITH SQUID INK AIOLI: The best calamari ever! Breading was light, seemed to be cornmeal based, and did not adhere so well, but this was the best-tasting calamari or jellyfish dish I've had. Bright, acidic, fresh, with that great squid ink aioli. Wanted to lick the plate. A must-order, great start to our meal.LIONFISH CEVICHE: It was a bit sad to order and consume this dish while staring directly at a lionfish in the tank beside us. But lionfish are the cockroaches of the ocean and they need to be eaten! (True story, Google it.) The ceviche itself was very citrusy and the flavor of the lionfish was not the star of the dish, it seemed to be overpowered by the other ingredients. But the tempura shiso leaves were the best vessel for eating this! BF said he wouldn't get this again, but I am open to other versions of lionfish.MADE TO ORDER CAESAR: The Worcestershire flavor is more pronounced in this version than in others I've tried. Portion is easily shareable, the egg was perfectly poached.MONTEAMORE GRILLED CHEESE ON BAGUETTE WITH LOCAL HONEY: This dish is where my BF finally "got it" about why I was so anxious to come here ASAP. This is the best grilled cheese. It's not a traditional version, but it's crisp and buttery, with a bright, salty cheese balanced well by the use of local honey and plated with house-made pickles. Portion is small like the price tag ($6), great for sharing as a starter.CRISPY BRICK CHICKEN THIGH: WOW. The chicken thigh itself is so tender, and served atop a wonderful savory mushroom bread pudding. I cook with chicken thigh a lot, and don't particularly care for the texture of bread pudding, so I almost didn't order this but it really was amazing. The chopped chives on top added just the right amount of verdant freshness.HANDCUT PAPPARDELLE PASTA: BF's entrée choice at our server's recommendation, reminiscent of a beef stroganoff, sans beef. The pasta was thin, delicate ribbons, married with a heap of roasted mushrooms and artichokes. Great dish.CROISSANT FRENCH TOAST: BF's dessert pick, lots of flavors and textures going on here. Bread wasn't too thick, caramel apple cider sauce wasn't too sweet, and the fresh julienned green apples on top were a great accent. HEXX CHOCOLATE POT DE CREME: Simple but very good. Three slices of orange over a pot of rich chocolate mousse, with fennel pollen. I can't honestly tell you what the pollen tastes like but everything came together well- and this coming from someone who usually shies away from dishes that combine chocolate and citrus. The new industrial location is near their former dwelling, but with increased floor space and a kitchen. Adding the café concept is wonderful, and Vegas needs more spots like this that highlight local talent (both cooking and sourcing!) in a way that locals can appreciate. This is making the shortlist of places we will be bringing visiting friends and relatives. Hopefully they will expand hours at some point as they settle in.It took me awhile but I finally got around to having lunch at the Café at Artisanal Foods.  All the recommendations I had gotten were spot on.  This place is good!  I was fortunate to be able to order a prix fixe lunch with Chef Johnny Church deciding on the items I'd get.  They were:Ibérico ham amuse-bouche with caviarCurry Kabocha squash soupPiedmontese beef and octopus carpaccioLion fish cevichePancakes with seared Sonoma foie grasHand cut pappardelle with BologneseCrispy brick chicken thighHexx chocolate pot de crèmeThis lunch was dinner also because there was a lot of food and I didn't let anything go unfinished.  I was impressed with ingredients and preparations I don't normally see.  Tremendous creativity.  One of the last things I would have ordered would be the pancakes.  Yet, it was an excellent dish with a mix of three kinds of grape made into a gastrique and served with foie gras topping the small stack of mini pancakes.  Fantastic flavors and since I don't use maple syrup, a delight having a sweet that was so different with pancakes.Chef Church asked me which pasta of two on the menu I wanted.  I looked at both and went with the Bolognese.  What he did was serve me the Bolognese with the hand cut pappardelle which was the other pasta.  The pork sausage, ground lamb, and chicken liver confit along with the tomato and mirepoix provided a great pasta.  The Bolognese was very rich.I need mention the soup.  The curry squash soup had a very good flavor of curry and was a delightful soup on this cold day.Finally, the crispy chicken thighs on mushroom bread pudding was outstanding.  Chicken thighs cooked and removed from the bone, then put back together with a layer of truffle and quickly fried crispy and served on the bead of mushroom bread pudding.  Outstanding!Finishing off with a light dessert of Hexx chocolate pot de crème topped with orange slices and topped with fennel pollen.  Chocolate and orange is always a great combination and this was a winner, too!I'll be returning and enjoying some of the other items on the menu.  This café, although small and seating maybe twenty people at one time, is one of those places that will draw me back.  A most memorable lunch!
The Fire Side Public House=Great addition to East Liberty!I had never been to Station Street Hot Dogs so I was excited to check out its replacement. After a Saturday at the mall of shopping with my daughter we were famished. My fellow Yelp buddy Rochelle H. told me about The Fire Side Public House just opening the day before and that they were doing a "soft opening" and that all of the food was comped as long as you bought a drink (pop, beer etc.) so my daughter and I high tailed it over there to meet up with Rochelle and her daughter and check the place out! Upon entering we were greeted and asked to be seated right next to Rochelle and her daughter. Surprisingly the place wasn't packed at all. A few seconds later Dane C. our waiter came over and took our drink orders. The concept of the restaurant is all about the wood fire grill that sits in the middle of the restaurant that everything is cooked on. They also specialize in craft beer. The menu consists of Small Bits, Wings, Wood Grill Items, Salads and Skillet served items for now will more items to be added once the restaurant is running at full capacity. My daughter started off with the Beer Cheese & Bacon Fires (Fresh cut fries, Apple Wood Bacon and Smoked Cheddar Beer Cheese) off the Small plates menu and I went with the Smoked Chicken Nachos. (Apple Wood Smoked Chicken, tortilla chips, grilled corn, black beans, sour cream, salsa verde and avocado.) I also added a order of grilled Garlic Parmesan wings. A few minutes later our small plates came. Let me tell you that there is nothing small about the Smoked Chicken Nachos portions! It could easily feed two to three people! I only ate about half. My daughter loved her Beer Cheese Fries as well.For our main dishes my daughter choose the Fire Side Burger (Grass Fed Beef, Apple Wood Bacon, pickles, White Cheddar, lettuce, tomato and onions on a Brioche Bun). I choose the Chicken Skillet Pasta (Chicken Sausage, fire roasted tomatoes, Basil infused cream, Pappardelle and Fontina Cheese). It was absolutely delicious! I took a bite of my daughters burger and let me just say that I was one of the best burgers I have ever tasted! I finally got my wings after my main food already came. It was the place's second night being open so I will cut them some slack. After we were done with our meals we had to try the desserts. My daughter ordered the Campfire S 'Mores (Fire Roasted Marshmallows, milk chocolate, and Honey Grahams cereal). I picked the Blueberry Cobbler. The blueberry cobbler was simply spectacular! My daughter must of loved her S 'Mores as she finished it before I could even taste it! Dane C. took excellent care of was the entire evening and never let our glasses get more than a quarter empty before he brought us another Pepsi. My only complaint it that the wings need to come out a lot faster then there are now. I'm sure once the kinks get worked out that this will be rectified.I also had the pleasure of meeting the owner Robert Miller who also owns Sidelines Bar & Grille. He was very appreciative for my critiques,  ideas and feedback.I think the restaurants concept will be welcomed with open arms by the East Liberty community.
Tampopo Ramen=New ramen restaurant in Phoenix! I saw one of yelper's checkin a few days ago and couldn't wait to try here for myself.Grand opening was Monday 11/2, so still new here. Looking at menu, I thought they really researched Phoenix market by adding several spicy optionsI was in search of authentic Hakata ramen, so I stayed with basic Hakata ramen with my noodle al-dente, just like true Hakata style.Ramen came with kikurage (can't remember English name) but dark seaweed looking one on the picture I posted. Very authentic. Soft boiled egg was warm and flavorful. Unfortunately they put too much black paper on my soup and couldn't really enjoy the broth. I add black pepper only to Sapparo ramen. Hakata ramen goes well with sesame. I also ordered side of gyoza. Gyoza tasted very authentic, and I enjoyed them well.Service was not there yet. Considering they just opened, I thought it wasn't fair to say anything yet.Next time when I come back, I will ask them not to add any black pepper in my soup, and pay small extra to add more flavor to my soup. Let's see how that gets close to what I am used to eat every time I visit Fukuoka.Fact:  Justin Timberlake's hair in the 1990's was an unintentional advertisement for instant ramen.More like subliminal messages.  Amirite?Anyways, three of us came here for dinner on a lovely chilly Thursday night.  We were seated at the bar, front row seats to the magic noodle show [get your mind outta the gutter!] by an informative and cheerful waiter.  The three of us got a variety of items to share with each other.  We had ordered two Tako Wasabis, two Hirata Buns, an Agedashi Tofu, Tonkatsu Ramen with the rich soup upgrade, a Miso Ramen, and an Ultra Spicy Ramen.  Boy am I bloated.Let's talk appetizers:  I originally wanted to get my beloved Takoyaki but the Takowasabi caught my eye.  I never had it before so I was mildly surprised when we received two martini glasses full of raw octopus with fresh wasabi and pickled ginger.  Any time a place has fresh wasabi, I'm all for it but man was it pungent!  That first bite packed a punch.  Like the Takowasabi was Holly Holm and I was Ronda Rousey.  I loved the raw octopus but that sour pucker from the ginger and the burning sensation from the fresh wasabi was pretty intense.  I wish the server told us that one ordered would have been enough for the three of us because we didn't even finish the second glass.  Next we had the Hirata Buns [steamed pork belly buns].  I assumed they would serve it like this place we went to in Las Vegas this past Saturday which is $3 for one bun.  Since only two of us wanted it, had I known they were served in pairs, we would have gotten just one order.  Granted, they give you two buns for $3 but they're relatively small.  I could have done without this because it didn't seem like they steamed the buns at all.  They were cold and cracking and not warm and squishy.  It made the first bite unpleasant.  I also wish there was an option to get regular Kewpie mayo instead of the spicy mayo.  The spicy mayo was delicious for sure but there was too much going on.  Kewpie mayo is more delicate and I think it's perfect for pork belly.  As for the Agedashi Tofu, these were good but not as crispy as I would have liked it.Now I'm not going to get into all the different kinds of ramen we had in great detail but I will say that they were all pretty darn good.  We were informed that Tampopo has one of ten ramen pulling machines in the U.S.  They are the ONLY ones in Arizona with this contraption.  The noodles were cooked al-dente.  They held the delicious soup well and had great texture.  Any time a noodle can hold up the broth and flavor is a win in my book.  I also love how you can not only see the collagen floating in the broth but feel it sticking to your lips which is no easy feat as I had lipstick on.  The Rich Soup Upgrade (+$1) had a great amount of pepper I wasn't anticipating despite reading Yuko H.'s review but I didn't mind it that much.  I will admit that I wish the eggs were more runny.  I want to crack my egg in half and have the yolk turn my broth into more richness.  The cha shu was a bit on the tougher side as well.  I like my cha shu a little more fatty for the melt-in-your-mouth feel.All in all, I had a pretty great meal.  I would love to try their Takoyaki and Curry Ramen next time.  Hands down a great ramen experience in Arizona.  I wish you great success, Tampopo!When Yuko wants to try out a new ramen place, you go with her, because she knows.  Our first time here was fabulous.  I ordered everything she did (Tonkotsu ramen and gyoza), because I was in ramen training.In an unexpected turn of events, the ramen arrived before the appetizer, but that didnt stop me from wolfing down all 6 yaki gyoja once they hit the tabletop.  The ramen was a delight, with a delicious pork belly surrounded by things, a floaty egg and my first love: noodles.  The egg was cooked perfect, with a runny yolk.This day was extra special, because that's when I found out about kae dama... which is Korean for "Bring me extra noodles, please".  I dont know, maybe its Japanese.  Anyway, an extra order of noodles is only $1.50, but it takes a frickin long time, so if you think you want some, order some once they set the ramen on your table.During my return visit, the yolk was cooked too long, but the service was UNPARALLELED!!!  George, my waiter, was outstanding.  He essentially fawned over me, explaining the process, and showing me the fancy high tech noodle making machine from Korea.  This kid has a bright future in whatever he sets his mind to, because he has a winner's attitude!
Yanagi Sushi=Yummy yummy yummy I got GREAT sushi in my tummy!!! This place is fantastic!! I mean worth more than a 5 star!!! The staff is very friendly, the place itself is small but put together very well, very clean and has a relaxed atmosphere. Their menu is pretty large, all kinds of different rolls to chose from, sashimi, salads,  soups, kids platters..... something for everyone. They have a really good happy hour, different hot and cold saki, saki bombs, beer and wine. I was really glad I found this place on Yelp and decided to give it a shot! The sushi was so fresh and tasty, no problems at all, like heaven in my mouth! It was really nice to go to a place that has 5 star food and 5 star service! Now I know why almost every review is 5 stars, they are truly a 5 star place! Cant wait to go back when I get another sushi craving, think this is going to be my new sushi spot!!
The Chocolate Moose=After going to the movies my husband and I noticed on the marque a notice for 'the chocolate moose' we saw some very nice looking treats but could not figure out the location. A week later we are again walking out of the theater and saw the same marque, so this time we drove around the shopping center until we found it. It's tucked between the casino and the theater.Once inside I notice the 'menu' wall and a listing for sandwiches and salads. The cupcake listing the favorites and prices for large orders, what I didn't see is the food. I mean they were out of almost all cupcakes and their glass bakery case was nearly empty!For 1130am on Sunday, I thought I'd see lots of things, but was surprised to see it bare. They had a handful of strawberry cupcakes and a few lemon blueberry. But the other cases were empty. The big dessert case at the end had maybe five items but no items were labeled on display, I asked about one, I thnk he called it a greek yogurt cheesecake? I picked one of those and a lemon blueberry cupcake, both very good, flavors strong, cake moist and the chhesecake very dense. There were others in eating lunch, they had ordered salad and a sandwich, I notice they had a list of breads for the sandwich and they made each order fresh. I was disappointed in the lack of choices for cupcakes and such but impressed with my order, will definately be back to try again, hopeful it's just new business jitters!
ChiAm Restaurant=Horrible. Serving shumai does not make a restaurant a dim sum place.  This is a terrible copy of Panda Express.  Tried the teriyaki chicken and walnut shrimp.  3 pieces of shrimp and 4 pieces of chicken and rice for 12 bucks.  If it was good then maybe. YuckWell I waited a month for this place to open.  Some how 4 wings and 2 pieces of dimsum with some noddles cost me 20$.  I explained to them I had ordered the side of noddles 3.99 the appetizer 298 pick two (chicken wing and spring roll)  and two peiece of dim sum 188 each.  10 bucks is what I come up to 12 with my drink.  but it was 18.99.It was bad.  It really isn't a dimsum place.  I had to throw away my meal after a couple of bites.  The staff was very nice and pleasant.I went to jack in the box and got two tacos and a plain hamburger because I was starving.  cost 2.14.  really bummed wanted it to be good so bad.I am not sure what to make of ChiAm.  They seem to have an identity crisis with the dim sum as part of it's brand name.   I was hoping for a good quality dim sum place opening up in North Las Vegas, but I was highly disappointed with the selections of dim sum.  The few varieties of shumai, which were okay and nothing to rave about.  The other dishes were really salty and blend. The food was also really expensive for what they offered compare to Panda Express and other Chinese restaurants.TL;DR: Sui mai does not a dim sum restaurant make.Lured in my the words "dim sum" on the exterior building, I knew I was in trouble when I walked in to the cafeteria-style setup. I looked at the menu, and the only thing in the dim sum category is sui mai (four types). The sides/apps section included a Pacific Shrimp Ball. Majority of offerings are premade, sitting-under-a-heat-lamp, exposed-to-the-air offerings you can find at any Chinese fast-food joint. They claim to use higher-quality, organic ingredients but if you're going to serve it this way, it doesn't matter. At 7PM there were no customers, so the freshness of the food was questionable. The items I sampled were average if not slightly below. Sui mai were huge, golf-ball-sized items, which helped to justify the ~$1.30 charge per piece. Shrimp items were fresh, juicy, and nicely shrimpy. Pork and chicken(?) sui mai did not stand out. I'm not fully convinced these aren't out of a freezer and just freshly prepared.
The Waterhole=Finally I had the chance to check this place out. What a treasure in the heart of Chinatown. You would never spot this place from driving around. It really is from word of mouth, quite exclusive from the public eye. Once you find this place, it looks closed.. again, think exclusive. Don't be intimidated to open the door, you'll feel like you're at a house party without the stress of finding a spot to throw it at. I've been putting off of coming here for some time due to work and life events, but once I did stop by I've been coming back every week since! The owners are welcoming, kind, and extremely accommodating. THANK YOU for Everything. Hospitality at its best! One of the reasons why I love coming here. Great vibe, spacious venue, music... the music is heartfelt. Soul driven.. nobody needs to tell you to "get up and dance" you just pop up and do it. This place makes you feel at home. An undeniable comfort for music lovers. There are not many places where you can truly appreciate the culture that the owners of this Ultra Lounge brings.This Ultra Lounge emphasizes more strongly on the different Hip Hop genres versus the infamous club music of trance and house music, which all of Vegas nightclubs are all about. I'm more about the Hip Hop Hooray than the acid beats of what in the heck is this?! If you like some general knowledge of what Hip Hop is... this is from the Global Awareness through Hip Hop Culture Program: "Hip Hop is the constantly evolving spirit and consciousness of urban youth that keeps recreating itself in a never-ending cycle. It is joy, sorrow, pleasure, pain, victory, defeat, anger, happiness, confusion, clarity, humor, intensity, dream, nightmare, life, death, and everything else in between. It is the spirit that connects the past to the present and lays a path towards the future."There are live performances from some amazing, talented artists on particular nights. Sometimes on Wednesday or Thursday nights, they even have special limited food menu from creative chefs from the Food Network shows. My favorite is Friday nights, which is Riddim in the Red. A mixture of Reggae, Dancehall, and Jawaiian. The energy here is intoxicating. The drink specials is a wonderful reason to replenish frequently ;) If you're hungry, they do provide a delicious food menu to go with your quench of thirst. The staff, itself is a dedicated team. All smiles and ready for the night. Any spills, empty beer bottles, finished dishes, you name it.. they are on it like flies on.. on.. well you know!? Quite attentive to guests needs and they know how to keep this place lookin' fresh and so clean. Love our server Nick though. His enthusiasm and fun-loving attitude makes you just beam with good spirits :D He brought over some Tequila shots and I told my friend as soon as Nick turned around.. drink it for me hurry!!! Then Nick turned out and said... I saw that! O.o My stunned face was priceless.. I told my friend.. omg he has eyes on his butt or what?! How did he know?!! :P Love you, Nick.Ideal place for Birthday Celebrations and Holiday Get Togethers! Or just to unwind after a long week or night at work.Love the fact that you can't smoke inside. Deal breaker :P DJs always spinning the greatest hits. I once danced for three hours straight here. The music was too good to sit down. My thighs and ribs paid a hefty price for it and took a week to recover. Reggae can have that effect on you. The dance floor can be wherever you are standing. Although, there is an open space near the dj booth, if you like to dance with the crowd. Seating wise, there are 6.. 3 individual sized tables with 2 leather booths side by side for large parties, 2 long tables with bench seating on each side in the middle, and 2 small tables in the middle with a big enough leather seat that can fit around 4 people. You can also have a seat at the bar, which has 4 stools. The volume of the music is loud enough to enjoy listening to, but also you can have a decent conversation without having to yell in each other's ear! I thought that was brilliant in their way in making it a place to drink, dine, talk, and dance. A marvelous combination that speaks for itself. And for me, that speaks volumes in the value and admiration of what they offer here. I have a tremendous amount of love and respect for this place. It takes so much out of me to get out of the house, because my home is my serenity. BUT this Ultra Lounge is an exception. This feel good music venue is something you can't get enough of and is a one of a kind addition to our community. I love supporting local businesses and this one is definitely on the top of my favorite list!
Chada Street=Located in the ridiculously busy Chinatown shopping center off Spring Mountain & Valley View, Chada Street is the second restaurant from the minds of Chada Thai & Wine. While I've never been to the original, I've heard great things, and definitely wasn't going to turn down an invite to check out this new spot for opening day. The space itself is pretty big. There's plenty of seating if you plan to dine-in only, but with the menu style and how they set the place up, it looks like they might be catering more to the hang out crowd. They not only have a pretty good size bar, but also a lounge type area with big couches and tables. It's just a really nice space with a neat setup, and I can see them being crazy busy when things start rolling.With only one page, it might look there isn't much to the menu...but looks can be deceiving. There's actually a decent amount of things to choose from, and a lot of variety as well. Soups, salads, meats, seafoods, desserts. It's all there. Everything is said to be inspired by Thai style street food and served small plate/tapas style, so it's perfect for sharing too. Pricing isn't bad either. Our table of 5 ordered a pretty good amount of food, and only spend about $80. Drinks not included of course. Out of everything we ordered, there really wasn't anything I didn't enjoy...but quite a few things stood out too. One of my favorite items was the Moo Tod Nam Pla (fried pork belly). It was the perfect combination of tender and crispy at the same time, but had great flavor and is served with an excellent Thai chile dip. I was also a huge fan of their two styles of Pad Thai. One is more traditional, while the other is made with stuffed crispy wontons. Both are big on flavor, with the wonton version bringing in an interesting concept with textures that I've never had in Pad Thai anywhere else. Other standouts were the Larb Moo Tod (larb meatballs), Sai Oua (house made spicy sausage) and Sa Tay (chicken skewer). Another dish I have to mention is the Tod Mun Pla (spicy fish cake), which was served with crispy basil leaves that were crazy addicting. I liked that everything had bold flavors, and nothing was overly spicy, at least for my tastebuds. The portions were quite a bit bigger than I expected too.The service was alright, considering it was their first day, but we did have to ask for some things more than once. And for whatever reason, we had to ask for an order of the Grilled Corn Butter a good 3 or 4 times, but it still came out very last and wasn't worth any sort of wait anyhow. Oddly, they were also out of a few items. We really wanted to try the chicken wings, but they had none. Then when we went to order 1 of their only 2 available desserts, they were out of mango. Considering they were only officially open for about 2 hours when we came, that was really surprising.At the end of our meal, the chef came out to introduce herself and ask us about our meal. It was a nice touch and overall, I really enjoyed Chada Street. I can definitely see myself coming back.I expected something very different being named Chada STREET. The ambience was on the fancy side and even had couches in the front for the drinkers. The lights are dimmed to set that romantic atmosphere like Chada Thai.When you put street food in my head.... I tend to think of street food prices. Here they don't offer that. I ordered: Pad Thai: I wish you could of seen my eyes when they gave it to me! It was so small. It was literally 1/3 of the portion from chada Thai. Tom yum $10: I had to ask for no coconut milk for this since they only had tom yum kai. It's the same as Chada Thai and I think their tom yum is always great. Perfectly sour and spicy(ask for hot if you like spicy) Spicy chicken wings$7: it comes with only 5 but they were surprisingly good! It's a dry rub and has a little sour kick to them. Crispy pork belly $6: wish it was a little more crispy! I also had to sprinkle some salt to give it some flavor. Crab fat fried rice $12: very good! It had a great seafood crab taste. It could of used a little bit more crab meat. The service was very attentive. Our waters were constantly refilled and we were always checked up on.I'll only come back for certain dishes that's worth the price.Seven of us gathered here to share several dishes.  We ordered:Crab fried riceCrab curry with vermicelli noodlesGrilled pork skewersNorthern Thai spicy pork sausageDuck curryPork and pineapple curryCrispy pork hockFried pork bellyChicken wingsCatfish curryLarb moo- ground porkTwo honey toast - one which vanilla and one with chocolate ice creamShaved iceBread with pandan custardChada Street's emphasis is on Thai street food served in a small plates manner.  My favorites of the dishes we tried were the pork sausage, crab fried rice, duck curry, catfish curry, and larb.  All were flavorful and I would order any of them again.  The crab curry was very good but would have been better served with rice than vermicelli noodles.  They varied a little in spice level but I'd say medium spiciness for most people.  The honey toast was OK with my favorite topping being the vanilla ice cream.The dishes I was not as impressed with were the pork belly--it needs to be crispier, the pork skewers were OK but nothing special, and I thought the pork hock was the biggest let down of the meal.  Except for the fatty outside section in one area, it just didn't do anything for me.Service was a mixed bag.  On ordering the many dishes, it was asked that the dishes be coursed out and not brought all at once.  We were finishing the first dishes when some more were brought and almost immediately three more were brought out.  We reused them and they were taken back to the kitchen.  At first we had to ask for clean share plates.  Later in the meal, they changed them without asking and they provided some clean silverware.Make sure you get the limenade.  It's a very tasty, refreshing citrus drink.  Too bad they ran out just before I ordered a second glass so I made do with water.Items Selected:Blue Pea LimenadeSai Oua - Northern Style Spicy Herb SausageMoo Ping - Garlic Pork SkewersKao Pad Mun Pu - Crab Fried RiceSen Mee Kang Pou - Crab Curry with Rice NoodlesKang Kua Supparos - Pork and Pineapple CurryDuck Panang - Crispy Roasted Duck with Panang CurryKa Moo Tod - Crispy Pork HockPeak Kai Saap - Spicy Tangy Chicken WingsPad Ped Pla Duk - Crispy Catfish with Chili Paste and Green BeanLarb Moo - Ground Pork, Chili, Onion, Lime Juice, Fish SauceMoo Tod Nam Pla - Fried Pork Belly with Nam Prik NoomO-Aew - Shaved Ice, Coconut Jelly, Palm Seed, Red Bean, Black JellyKanom-Pung Sung Kaya - Warm Bread with Pandan CustardHoney Toast - ChocolateHoney Toast - VanillaIn some ways taking a "casual" detour from the more traditional cuisine of Chada Thai and Wine on Jones, Bank Atcharawan's recently launched Chada Street sees the acclaimed chef take on an aggressive menu of items commonly consumed from the vendors of Thailand's street markets, the results oftentimes resoundingly successful though service still has a long way to go.Elegantly decorated in a stripmall on Spring Mountain, the bustling plaza unfortunately falling short of parking on Saturday at 7:30pm, Chada Street occupies a footprint nearly threefold the size of Bank's original restaurant and with a well-appointed bar beneath a photographic mural stretching the length of the dining room the seating options offered are multiple, the leather-clad lounge up front perfect for relaxation while a more proper meal is offered amongst low-lit tables or a private room extending back behind all-glass wine storage.Prominently featuring Rieslings, though certainly not lacking for well-priced spirits sourced from around the globe, it was with menus presented beneath lightly playing tunes from Chvrches that our party of seven made selections, a total of twelve plates complimented by three more at the chef's discretion proving an adequate amount of food for all persons present with some actually leaving quite stuffed. Noting up front that waitresses undoubtedly speak better English than I do Thai, suffice it to say that language barriers played a big part in service issues almost from the moment seats were taken and despite repeated requests to have items paced out it was not once but twice that items were returned to the kitchen, drink refills clearly not on the list of priorities despite the menu's bold spice profile while other oysters and pandan custard were forgotten until staff was reminded.Speaking next to the quality of the kitchen it should seem obvious that such a broad menu is bound to occasionally miss the mark, but setting aside pork belly that was surprisingly devoid of flavor and O-Aew that was more snow-cone than shaved ice the rest of the cuisine was well crafted and occasionally quite stunning without once drifting too spicy to be appealing.Doing our best to experience a wide swath of Chada Street's cuisine it was perhaps with good fortune that opening plates showed most strongly, and with blue tea that turned purple with the addition of citrus adequately refreshing palates between bites both the housemade  pork sausage and duo of crabs were each boldly flavored and nicely presented, a requested side of rice helping sop up the Sen Mee Kang Pou's sauce while skewers of grilled pork would have better ordered in double to allow for more sharing.Already seeing the 8-top's capacity likely to be challenged by sizable service plates and portions defying the low costs it was mere moments after round one that two more curries presented, the slightly overcooked pork shank also allowed to be delivered while four more plates were refused, then sent back once more to be reprepared just ten minutes later so that the crispy skinned fowl and pork in a pool of spicy pineapple broth could properly be savored.No doubt attuned to his recipes, Atcharawan's spicier plates saved until later in the meal, it was with a light tingle from the crab and duck sill lingering on the lips that the oft-raved larb was presented, and 'hot' to some even though requested medium both the flavor and texture were indeed excellent, the catfish in chili paste equally praiseworthy while the crisp chicken wings got a little lost in a flavor I presume was a numbing spice mixed with tamarind. Passing on durian based desserts and modestly amused by the mix-ins beneath the aforementioned 'shaved ice,' it was perhaps 'lucky' that a double order of warm bread beneath sweet custard reminiscing of Ghostbusters was brought forth singular since several in the group were already topped off, the duo of honey toasts forgivingly smaller than those at Hachi or Izakaya and undoubtedly benefited by more honey and creamier ice cream.****Still finding its footing, the front of house lagging behind the skills of those at the stoves, Chada Street is a welcome addition to a genre that has seen great growth since Lotus of Siam became a destination.A week after my visit to Chada Street, I'm still wavering between three and four stars. Looking back at all the food our group of seven was able to try, there were a couple of standouts but for the most part most of the dishes were just incredibly solid. We started our meal with the blue pea limenade which was refreshing and a fun novelty with the color-changing aspect of the drink. I highly recommend starting with this if you visit. My favorite dishes from the meal were the crab fried rice, northern style sausage, crab curry and the larb. The sausage was exceptional as it was incredibly spicy and flavorful. The crab curry had excellent flavor although it didn't come with many noodles to absorb all the sauce, so I'd recommend ordering extra or a side of rice to assist. I don't typically enjoy ground meat, but since we had all heard great things about Chada's larb, I admit I did really enjoy the flavors. We ordered a number of desserts as well and although they serve two different versions of one of my favorite desserts, my favorite was the warm bread cubes with pandan custard. We all noted it's resemblance to ectolasm, but it was tasty and unique. The rest of the dishes were all good, but didn't leave as memorable an impression on me. Service was friendly albeit a little forgetful. The pacing of the dishes was a little quicker than we would have preferred and actually had to ask the server to slow down the dishes to allow us time to eat the first rounds before the next arrived. The restaurant is very nice and I'm interested in trying more dishes on a future visit.Came in after a long work day for tapas-sized Thai dishes solo at the bar. The selection is good, and the quartet of dishes I ordered were all fairly solid, but I guess I expected better. Service was friendly and attentive, wide assortment of wine and beer available, classy and romantic atmosphere with low lighting.SAI OUA: House-made Northern Thai sausage. This is one of the more unique dishes on the menu, served with a variety of garnishes (lettuce, onion, peanut, ginger) that bring out the various herbal flavors within the sausage itself. Lots of heat in this, watch out.MOO PING: Garlic pork skewers, simple but well executed. Five skewers for $6, tender meat and fragrant with garlic. Enjoyable if safe dish.POR PIA YUAN: Fresh spring roll with vegetables and pork meat loaf? This seemed like another simple, straightforward dish, but the punch of herbal flavor beats any other version in town. This was paired with an odd dipping sauce similar to a hot-and-sour? The combination didn't really work for me, but I enjoyed the rolls themselves.HOR MOK PHUKET: Curry fish cake wrapped in banana leaf. Probably my favorite dish that I ordered, with just the right amount of heat and a comforting combination of curry and fish, formed into a patty and wrapped like a gift. I especially liked how fresh thai basil leaves were also included in the packet. I know the menu is intended to be skewed more toward the "street foods" of Thailand, but it seemed like there were far too many safe, predictable dishes on the menu. Perhaps a separate "street" menu would be more helpful? I find myself more likely to return to their sister restaurant, Chada Thai, than come back- but I do want to try the crab fried rice and crab larb dishes with a wine or two. I am heartbroken that they don't have khao soi though, that's the ultimate disappointment here.Overall, the dishes are great. Delicious; great flavors. I love the style of small plates because I really hate having to choose between a few favorites. It's a wonderful place to hang out with two or more friends (an optimal group is 3-4 to try several dishes at once with the right amount of food). There are a few dishes that are simply okay, but nothing to ruin the dining experience. Explore while you're here and don't just order Pad Thai.Kao Pad Mun Pu ($12): Crab fat fried rice. A simple fried rice with crab meat and eggs placed atop. The first time I had this dish, it had quite a bit of crab and although a usually subtle flavor, came through nicely. That was not my experience the second time and made it less enjoyable. It's a tasty dish, but I probably wouldn't order it again.Sai Oua ($8): Northern Thai spicy herb sausage. Delicious. It's just like the ones I had in Thailand. The flavors, especially the lemongrass, makes this one of my absolute favorite sausages. Keep in mind, it is quite spicy. I love the accompaniments of cabbage, red onion, ginger, and peanuts; everything is wonderful together.Duck Panang ($18): Crispy roasted duck with panang curry. The duck is juicy and the skin is unbelievably crispy. Wowzers. The panang is tasty, although a little sweet for my preference.Som Thum Thai ($7): Green papaya salad with dehydrated shrimp, peanuts, tomato, and green bean. Standard papaya salad; nothing special.Moo Tod Nam Pla ($6): Fried pork belly with Nam Prik Noom (Northern Thai style green chili dip). Phenomenal. The pork belly was delicious (as pork belly usually is) and the skin was crispy. The green chili dip was flavorful without being spicy and it was great with the pork. This is definitely one of my favorites.Tod Mun Pla ($7): Spicy fish cake with crispy Kaffir lime leaves. These cakes were oval rather than flat, so there was more texture to them rather than just being crispy and I liked that a lot. These are the best Thai-style fish cake I've had. Delicious!Larb Pla Dook ($8): Catfish, rice powder, chili, lime juice, fish sauce, mint, onion, and cilantro. I love larb. We got catfish to do something different and it's great, but I think I prefer pork.Pla Muk Yang ($15): Grilled jumbo squid with seafood sauce. Yum! The squid was so good and that seafood sauce is amazing. It's a green chili sauce with phenomenal flavor. I'm sure it works with a lot of other food.Pad Kee Mao w/ Shrimp ($10): Flat noodles, chili, garlic, and Thai basil. Also known as Drunken Noodles. Pad Kee Mao is one of my all-time favorite Thai dishes and this one was rather disappointing. It was decent, but no where near impressive. This is another dish I wouldn't order again.Kanom Pung Sung Kaya ($6): Warm bread with pandan custard. I really enjoyed this dessert. The bread is chewy and fluffy, so that was already lovely and the pandan custard is so darn tasty! I may need a whole plate to myself next time.Chada Street gets a solid 4/5!Love the ambiance. Very sophisticated and modern. Large mural like artwork behind the main bar and a visible wine cellar near the back of the restaurant. Dimly lit to set a warm and pleasant dining experience.The dishes are tasty and portions are decent. I went with 2 others and we ordered a variety to share:- Por Apia Yuan (Veggie Spring Rolls w/ Pork)Delightful and came with a serving of 6 small pieces. Also had mint and basil to give it a refreshing taste and was paired with a yummy peanut dipping sauce - Hor Mok Phucket (Steamed Fish Curry in Banana Leaf)Came out piping hot and a little fishy. For those who enjoy seafood but are not a fan of food that tastes "too fishy" this is not a dish for you. Very flavorful with the slightest spicy kick to it - Street Chicken Pad ThaiPretty average and a little dry. Definitely had better Pad Thai before. One of my least favorite dishes I tried - Kang Kai Nor Mai (Chicken Curry w/ Bamboo Shoot) Tasted like a Thai Red Curry... It was delicious! Does not come with white rice so if you want rice, make sure to order separate- Chicken Pad Kee MowDoused in whatever sauce Pad Kee Mow is stir fried in. Very flavorful though and had a lot of veggies in it- Moo Tod Nom Pla (Fried Pork Belly)The fried pork belly was to die for. We ordered another serving because we inhaled our first order. It came with a dip that reminded me of pico de gallo (a Thai infused pico?) but the batter on the pork belly was salted perfectly and the pork belly was SO juicy that I didn't even use any of the dip after my first initial try. Definitely a must try- Peak Kai Krob (Spicy Chicken Wings) Ginormous sized fried chicken wings. Came with 5 wings. Deliciously seasoned with a strong taste of lime and spice but the 2 flavors worked!- Honey ToastDelicious per usual. Topped with Vanilla and Chocolate ice cream, diced fruit, chocolate syrup and chopped nutsI started off with a beer but we ended up sharing a bottle of Riesling to enjoy with the majority of our dinner. It paired fabulously with the Asian flavors!Service was on the slower side (we went on a Tuesday night, I spotted 3 servers and the place was decently busy) but the servers were all nice. The food overall was pretty good! The portions are not as small as tapas are typically served but they're also not the largest portion if you wanted to order just one dish. The size is smaller than typical Thai restaurants if you order a noodle dish like Pad Thai or go for a curry... I want to say 2/3 the normal size.I enjoyed sharing plates here and will definitely be back. Especially for that fried pork belly!
The Pizza Kitchen=This new kid in town is definitely a welcome addition to the southwest valley.  For only $7.99, you can custom build your own pizza.  There are three different crusts to choose from - traditional, wheat and gluten free. Quite a few sauces and cheeses to pick from including their house blend cheese and a kale pesto sauce that I would have to try next time.  They have all the traditional types of meats such as meatball, italian sausage, bacon crumble and some not so traditional meats such as sweet sriracha chicken and some vegan meats too.  What I really love in their veggie section is the grilled zucchini.  Once your custom pizza is made, it is flashed cooked in under 5 minutes thru a conveyor belt.  It doesn't have the crispiness of a wood fired pizza, but I like it a lot because the crust is chewy and not too crispy. Their toppings are fresh and quite tasty.  I ordered their traditional crust pizza with pesto sauce.  Then I loaded it with house blend cheese, Italian sausage, meatball, chicken breast, ham, black olives, artichokes, grilled zucchini, mushroom, roasted garlic and spinach.  They actually put the spinach on top after cooking so the spinach doesn't get all crispy and all dried up. It was very appealing to look at and quite delicious.  The crust wasn't all dried up.  But when I got the pizza home it wasn't very hot at all.  It was actually only lukewarm.  I don't know if that was because there were too much toppings and it should have been cooked a little longer or because of the thin crust it cooled off real fast.  Maybe next time I would have to eat it there instead of asking for take out.I would definitely go back and try some other combinations.  I was a little surprised that they were not busy around supper time.  But bonus for me, because I did not have to wait in any line.TPK is the new pizza place to be at. Despite the lack of originality and potential confusion with the name (California Pizza Kitchen, anyone?), this place is my favorite custom built pizza place in Vegas so far... RIP Custom Built Pizza :( Cons: I'm so short, sometimes its hard for the workers to hear me over the glass. If the worker is also short, we have a hard time hearing each other lolAside from that, it's all pros for me. Their workers always have upbeat or very eager to help attitudes, which goes a long way in my book. The quality of their toppings is much more consistent and flavorful than Pieology. I never have to ask "can you please put some more of (topping)?" because they give a generous amount of everything you ask for. I love ordering the traditional crust with both house blend cheese and ricotta, then I'll add pepperoni, regular sausage, spicy sriracha sausage, bacon, mushrooms, roasted garlic and capers. They really won me over with the capers. I'm sure most people get the capers for their make-your-own salads, but I love capers as an anchovies or olives salty-substitute. Seating is plentiful inside, so it would be a great place to take kids post-sports practices or games. I usually come here when I don't know what I want to eat for lunch, too lazy to make dinner or just need some comfort food.
Bruno's Pizza=I hadn't heard of Bruno's Pizza until just a few weeks ago.  One of the folks at our martial arts school is from the same place Bruno's comes from and she thankfully made us aware.  Prior to Bruno's opening she brought some pizza in that they made while working out the finer points of the dough recipe for the climate here in Vegas.  It smelled great, they offered a couple of slices, and I found a new favorite.  It was just cheese pizza, and it was probably the best cheese pizza I can remember eating.  Ever.Excited that they finally had their soft opening on October 1st, we went in to try more of what they do, and we weren't disappointed.  We ordered the cheese pizza for my son and the meat lover's pizza for the two of us.  A side of garlic breadsticks and soft drinks complemented the pies and in no time we had our happy pizza faces on.The toppings were delicious and the crust was amazing even thought they'll tell you they're not quite content with it just yet.  Even more amazing:  no grease sitting on the pie or under the crust.  The meat pizza was delicious, the toppings were tender, and somehow they've found a way to get rid of all the grease and oil that seems to settle on pizzas like this.They're still getting their rhythm down, but Bruno's is a must visit place if you're on the southwest side of the valley.  Go enjoy a pizza, and help them hit their stride as they approach their grand opening and a full menu.Note: there used to be another pizza joint in the same location, so don't miss that it's a new place now.
Tapas 51=My husband and I are huge fans of the food truck, Chrome Toaster. Thus, after finding out that Chef Aaron opened up a restuarant in Fort Mill (where the old Passion 8 used to be), we had to go check it out!!We came here this past Friday evening around 8:30pm or so. The place was busy but we were seated immediately. Inside there are a good amount of tables, a large bar with numerous bar stools, and a side room with a large table that can be rented out for family events or to just casually sit at (I have a large Italian family that HAVE to sit at the same table, so I can totally appreciate this room with a huge table in it!!!). There is also an outside patio with numerous tables and lighting. The place is decorated, for lack of a better word, very cute!My husband ordered the Duck Rabbit Stout (the local beer selection was excellent!!!) and I got the Habanero Strawberry Marg. The margarita was absolutely delish and a perfect mix of spicy and sweet!We ordered four different things on the menu to share....since it is a tapas style restuarant. They came out at different times but there was never a long wait in between, which was perfect!! We got the shrimp pupusa (anyone that knows me knows I LOVE pupusas!!), brussel sprouts, tamale special of the day, and the duck confit tacos special of the day. The shrimp pupusa was definitely the highlight....so many awesome flavors and the shrimp were nice sized! The sprouts were perfectly cooked and the chorizo was a great flavor touch! The tamales were nice and light (came with two). Lastly, the duck tacos (came with 3). Man, such a great end to the meal!!! Chef Aaron stopped at all the tables throughout the night just to check on everyone and make sure they enjoyed their food, which I thought was a nice touch! This is such a great local place that truly makes an emphasis to serve delicious food with quality ingredients. I am so excited that Tapas 51 will be added to list of incredible, locally owned restaurants with the Charlotte area!
Killer Shrimp=Restaurants have come and go in this particular location in Townsquare way too many times. I really hope Killer Shrimp is here to stay!  Items tried:- Killer shrimp- Clam chowder- CalamariOur server was super nice and helpful. She recommended the killer shrimp, their signature dish, since it was our first time there. When the dish came out, it wasn't much to gawk over, but my tastebuds thought otherwise. The broth was so good! Loved the spice and the herbs. Dipping the bread in the broth was the best part. So addicting! Save time and avoid smelly fingers. Order your Killer Shrimp "shelled" for a peeled version. During happy hour the clam chowder is $5.  I can be a clam chowder snob, since I grew up in the bay area. There's nothing better than clam chowder in SF or Monterey at the pier. Not really comparable, but Killer Shrimp makes a really good version! I love the chunkiness of the chowder with all the clams, potatoes, and veggies. Save some bread to dip in your chowder too! The calamari ($6 HH) was easily forgettable. If in Townsquare, I prefer Brio or Fleming's calamari.It's literally been decades since I've been at the Killer Shrimp in Marina del Rey California. Located south of the Yard House and East of the Panda in restaurant is where you'll find this is establishment.They have a huge outdoor patio that wraps around the business since it's a corner unit. Inside you'll find a bar and dining room which is quite spacious. I started off with the spinach salad which contain the hard boiled eggs bacon and yummy. I followed with the fisherman's seafood entree which is a seafood stew that contained an assortment of seafood and was garnish with two pieces of toasted bread which was perfect for dipping into the sauce along with all the seafood. The portions are decent here and the prices are fair - everything was tasty and flavorful.If you like spicier flare go for the original killer shrimp wh i has a Cajun kick and  yummy too!
Sushi Way=Yumm alert!You like all you can eat sushi? Can you stuff it in your pie hole (sushi hole) in an hour? You betcha!For about $26 bucks for dinner, one person, no sharing, finish in an hour ANYTHING on the menu'. Challenge accepted!My dining guest does not eat sushi.... sadly... however, he did have some amazing pot stickers as well as some tasty katsu chicken; so there is something on the menu for our non sushi eating friends.Here is a tip as well....... you can order half sizes of the rolls! If you are anything like me you want to try as much as your sushi tummy can handle! Also, beer drinking is fun, but it does have a tendency to make that rice expand in your belly, so stick to water or their amazing tea... Lunch is around $21 smackers, all you can eat, no sharing... you get the idea...Oh yes I will be back!This experience went 100-0 real quick.When we got there the place wasn't crazy busy. We got seated right away and the servers were genuinely super nice and on top of things!The rolls were decent, we tried the following:Rolls-TigerShrimp LoverFreaky FridayBaked SalmonSpiderHot and JuicyLisa Hand RollAppetizers-Cucumber Crab SaladSeaweed SaladScreaming OrgasmSweet and Spicy PotstickersTempura CalamariDessert-Strawberry Mochi duhLike I said the rolls were decent but I'm sad to say we will not be returning due to the horrendous wait time to receive rolls.There was a time we waited 28 minutes for a roll. I get they only had two sushi chefs but there were times when we saw rolls waiting for ten plus minutes to be picked up and taken to tables. It's unfair to blame the chefs when they're doing their job.YELP 300 CHALLENGE 2015: #300 GOAL ACHIEVED!Saturday Solo Sushi-Round #3This past Saturday 12/12th, I arrived here after 2 unsuccessful attempts to eat at other AYCE sushi restaurants, that I walked out of due to a combination of bad service, questionable sanitary practices and no fresh oysters and AYCE limits on salmon roe. So here I am @ Sushi Way on Paradise Rd., 2 blocks N. of Flamingo, for my 3rd attempt of the evening to feast on AYCE sushi. I'm pleased to write the quote "Three Times A Charm" as Sushi Way is a fantastic AYCE sushi restaurant.Modern interior w/ plenty of pretty Christmas decor, House Music & Top Hits playing as background music from Pandora, friendly service from start to finish by the host and all employees. This enjoyable 90 minute AYCE delicious sushi dinner was competitively priced @ $26.95. TIP FOR THE LADIES: They offer 1/2 rolls so you can try a variety and not fill up so quickly.I sat in a comfortable chair at the L shaped granite counter sushi bar and began w/ a cold raspberry iced tea, fresh oysters and at least a half a dozen salmon roe with a stuffed Santa Claus as my dining partner.The sushi chef was welcoming, filled w/ smiles and had plenty of enthusiasm. His talents offered several hand crafted culinary works of art in a timely manner. He clearly loves his job here at Sushi Way! He prepared several delicious rolls i've never tried and some of my favorites that also tasted excellent. The Halibut was cut thick w/ excellent rice consistency. Jalapeno slices adorned the Yellowtail belly sashimi. The Spider Roll was very good w/ warm shrimp tempura. The Alaskan and Hawaiian rolls were flavorful favorites. Baked green mussels topped w/ a hot cheese sauce. Poke tuna salad was excellent! Garlic yellowtail was spicy good. The Sexy Lazy Special was a delight consisting of coconut shrimp tempura & cream cheese, topped w/ salmon, avocado & coconut flakes, w/ a spicy mayo sauce. Yum!The Rock & Roll Special was also a delight consisting of tuna, salmon, yellowtail, white fish and crab wrapped in cucumber, topped w/ "orgasm sauce." LOLFor dessert, I turned down the several offerings for 2 sea creatures. The Octopus had a perfect crunch and seawater taste. Eel had a smooth texture w/ warm sweet sauce that ended my Saturday Solo Sushi.Yay! I'm a fan.See 14 photos below...YELP 300 CHALLENGE 2015: #300 GOAL ACHIEVED!With multiple sushi joints popping up in Vegas, how does one stay ahead of the pack? Well, there's a no brainer here! Quality and Service are on top of my list of what I look for.I didn't stumble onto Sushi Way. It was under "hot and new" so I gave it a shot! I always prefer to be seated at the bar, so I can interact with the chef. It's also very entertaining to watch them prepare my meal.And wow! I was very impressed by the temperature of the sushi and the fish to rice ratio was excellent.I was even more impressed that the chef kept making items that were off menu! I was game for anything! I love that this place doesn't use a lot of cream cheese in their sushi as fillers! If I want to eat cream cheese, I have lots in my fridge! LOLHaving an option for sushi half rolls is another reason I consider when dining in and I'm glad this place offers that! Some places only do half rolls on your last order. Then there's the awesome staff at Sushi Way. Where they treat you in an AWESOME way!
The Counter Phoenix=So finally 50 N Central Avenue has a new tenant, The Counter. Open daily.The Counter offers sandwiches, salads, shake shake shakes, booze, and build-your-own-grilled cheese for $8, but the champions are the burgers.  Offering an incentive to have your burger and eat it too, they sell on average for $12-13, but if you build-your-own and indulge in extra fixin's, you'll be lighter $12-13 MINIMUM.All the favorites from fast food/sandwich shoppes are combined onto one menu. From regular ingredients to premium choices, from natural to organic. Currently the offerings are 3 patty sizes; beef patties, tuna, turkey, or chicken; 20 flavors of cheese slices or spreads; over 25 types of relish, mustard, salsa, aioli, vinaigrette, or other dressings (option to purchase a flight of 3); 40 different toppings of veggies, pickled stuffs, chili, meats; 8 types of buns; and $3 sides consisting of various fries, salads, veggies, and chili. Word to the wise, if you're an office folk who's only allotted a set number of minutes to eat at midday, download the 15 page menu from the website and give it a look-see in advance because after you've made your choices and go through the required 6-Step BYOB process you'll already need to head back to the office.1. Choose Your Burger2. Choose Your Cheese3. Choose Your Sauce4. Choose Your Toppings5. Choose Your Bun6. Choose Your SideStill want to eat here?I do! Their sign clearly reads "The Counter Custom Built Burgers" and one day I want to be the idiot who goes ALL veggie on 'em. Veg Up, b!tches. Unfortunately, it hasn't happen yet because on the afternoon that I went there was no take-out. Huhhh? I was told they were only fulfilling eat-in orders because things got too confusing and they couldn't handle both.Okay, now I'm confused. They've opened a restaurant downtown, directly adjacent to the Jefferson / 1st Ave metro stop, it was lunch time, and they were not fulfilling take-out orders.Wow. Wow.Uh, wow.Okay, I'll try back later.Hope y'all are still in business...I can't believe all of the negative reviews on this place. THEY'VE BEEN OPEN A WEEK, PEOPLE! CHILL!  Yes, there is a bit of a wait. Give these guys some time and I'm sure they'll run a tighter ship before long. I have been here twice and have been happy both times. The people that work here are all very friend and nice. I take onboard that it's pricey, but for $16 I got a 1/3 patty cooked medium rare, the way I like it, with cheddar, bleu cheese, bacon, spinach, grilled onions and sautéed mushrooms with a side of onion strings. The patty was SOLID: fresh and cooked to perfection; all of the extras were of high quality and the onion strings were DELICIOUS. I thought that they give you plenty of food. Yes, you pay more, but we're talking high quality ingredients, not pre-cooked McDonald's. I can't afford to do this every day but I deserve something like this once or twice a month. I'm really eager to try their milkshakes....and then there's the bar. Again, don't let the negative reviews deter you, this is right up my alley. If you're short on time, give them a few weeks to settle in or go later in the day, not during the lunch rush.The Counter is so conveniently located, it's hard not to pass by without thinking of stopping in for a bite to eat. That's why I've been back twice since my first visit (when I couldn't get take out - but we won't speak of that again).For my second visit, I dined-in and sat at the bar. Thought I chose a good spot, but folks still bumped me as they passed behind. Next time - table only. The couple next to me was sharing a burger and side. Not sure if it filled their bellies, but they seemed to enjoy every bite. On my other side someone ordered a grilled cheese without side. Looked a bit skimpy, so I can't imagine how filling that could have been.Every dish coming out of the kitchen looked yummy. The burgers were stacked and even though I'm not much of a flesh eater, I was thinking "dayum, me want burger."Anyway, reality. Like I said in my first review: I would be the idiot who went all veggie on 'em. So my build-your-own-burger sans burger turned out to be a bowl of salad. With a side order of yam fries without question.I was impressed with the salad - very fresh, very crisp, very green, very good. And the yam fries were tasty. Salted, not sweeted like other restaurants are serving them. The contrast of sweet to salty flavor was excellent and the fries accompanied my salad con mucho harmony. Tongue was happy, tummy be happy, me happy.For my third visit I had a jones for yam fries! or sweet pos as some folk calls 'em. I ordered take out. Decided on the build-your-own-grilled cheese. Requested all kinds of fixin's. In my head, i pictured the guys in the kitchen stuffing topping after topping between slices of bread and wrapping up a fat sammich for me - just like the fat burgers they serve. Nope, wrong answer. My grilled cheese was still on the skimpy side, though not as skimped as the grilled cheese the woman had during my second visit. When I got to my destination, I added two more toppings of my own. Don't get me wrong, it was a good sandwich, but nothing ticks me off more than having to re-dress something that was build-your-own in the first place. Tsk, tsk. Sweet pos were a total failure. I ate them straight from the box, but they tasted like the kitchen had either re-warmed them or twice fried (overcooked) them.Smh. What does disappointment mean?noun- the feeling of sadness or displeasure caused by the non-fulfillment of one's hopes or expectations.My jones was gone's.
J-Wok Cafe=New Asian fusion spot now open on the East side, complete with a pun-ny name! They have Thai and Chinese staple dishes for the traditionalists, and some fun specials, too. You can get any number of Thai/Chinese dishes here, and they're fairly solid- the pan fried potstickers (great dipping sauce!) and crab Rangoon (really light on the cream cheese) are made fresh daily, but my usual picks are the egg foo yung or the crispy pork with Chinese broccoli. My guy often opts for the orange chicken, chow mein, or the wor won ton soup (giant portion).  If you're feeling more adventurous, they offer some fusion specials.

Bravo Cucina Italiana=Don't get the "Pasta BRAVO!" entree.Now that we've gotten that out of the way, I think I can say that I've had enough good dishes to recommend this place. Located next to Dillard's and Larsen's Grill and facing Sunset Road, BRAVO! Cucina Italiana provides a sit-down option that's more upscale than other Galleria mall dining options such as Chevy's and Red Robin.I had the complimentary rosemary focaccia on both occasions. It's soft and herbaceous, and it soaks up all the liquid you might want. Their house olive oil and vinegar is quite tasty, but I wasn't as impressed with the herbed red dipping sauce that they provided on my second visit.I had Mama's Lasagna Bolognese ($17.99) during that first visit. It isn't exactly a traditional Italian lasagna. It's presented in an oval ceramic bowl, and it has an alfredo sauce and a Bolognese sauce, but it does have that gooey mozzarella on top, ricotta inside, and tasty ground beef spiced in an "Italian" way. There was a bit of a vegetable inside that give a crunch, and I enjoyed this as well. Oh, and the server hand-grates Parmesan cheese to top your lasagna to your liking. I had it 50% off on National Lasagna Day, and while I'm not sure how I feel about the full price value, I was quite happy with the deal.The second time around, I focused on their happy hour menu. They call it "Bar Bites" and provide it in the bar / high top seating section 3:30-6:30pm on weekdays, and all day on weekends. I shared some appetizers with my friend because they're such a good deal.The first app was Arancini ($3.95 Bar Bites price), which they describe as fried cheesy risotto. Maybe risotto is a bit off, and although they do invite comparisons to tater tots, they're very crunchy outside and creamy inside. They went well with either of the two dipping sauces, one a mildly spicy cream ("diavolo"), and the other a simple tomato sauce ("pomodoro").The Crispy Mozzarella Ravioli ($4.95 BB) was perhaps more delicious. It has a similar blend of textures as the first app, but richer flavor from the mozzarella. It comes with a horseradish aioli and a marinara sauce. Again, everything was good.The Spicy Bacon & Boursin Flatbread ($4.95 BB) sounded a lot better than it tasted. It should have been a home run with candied bacon, chared tomato sauce, caramelized onions, mozzarella, parmesan spicy aioli, and green onions. It wasn't bad, but none of the components stood out.Finally, we split that underwhelming Pasta BRAVO! ($15.99). Underseasoned if al dente rigatoni, underseasoned dry chicken, uninspiring mushrooms, and a decent roasted red pepper sauce needed all the help it could get flavor-wise, and I did have it in the form of leftover sauces from the apps. I just didn't think to use it until the last few bites, and it shouldn't be necessary. I'm disappointed that a dish that bears the restaurant name and is described as their "signature dish" was so underwhelming, but at least a $10-off-an-entree birthday credit via their myBRAVO rewards program took the sting out of the wallet.I didn't have any service issues, especially not on today's visit. They took orders and delivered food promptly (all apps simultaneously, entree son enough afterward). Also, they processed discounts just fine. I was glad to see that the BOGO Bar Bites appetizer w/ Yelp check-in worked in addition to the $10 credit.I avoided downgrading my rating to three stars because I would definitely come back to BRAVO! for cheap happy hour appetizers and the lasagna. Legit sit-down restaurants are few and far between in this area of Henderson near Sunset Station, but it looks like this sister restaurant of Brio Tuscan Grille has managed to fill a neighborhood niche, give or take one particular pasta dish.(UPDATE 12/23/15: Visit #3. Had $10 credit again for some reason, so I went back to Bar Bites. My favorite tonight was the Bravo! Fries at $3.95, with well-seasoned fries, delicious crumbled bacon, gorgonzola, creamy horseradish aioli, and green onions cut on the bias. The Bravo! Burger at $5.95 is quite serviceable overall with American cheese, the same aioli as the above fries, and unadorned fries w/ a side of ketchup. I thought the bun was rather bready though, and the patty wasn't perfectly medium-rare throughout. The Crispy Shrimp Napoli, $5.95, was the most disappointing due to too-soft shrimp and a relatively tame/bland sauce.)
Philly Steak Express=This place just opened yesterday (8/6/15).   I had my expectations very low it was a real Philly Steak they served because it's impossible to find here. Those of you that are expecting seasoned beef steak with coarse sat, paprika, ground pepper, Garlic powder, onion powder, and dried thyme.  That's not how the beef is seasoned here.  The owner didn't mind that I asked for a #3 Philly Steak salad without onion.  It had chick peas, diced tomato, and salad dressing was really good!  They're ranch dressing on the side was also very good.  They have White & Orange American cheese. No provolone or mozzarella.After I was done eating my salad I was reaching for an ice cold water from the frig.  Our food was take out and we live 2 miles up the road it wasn't long drive from the backside of Rhodes Ranch Golf Community.  I would go back again and try their chicken kabobs with a side of rice for $6.99. We came in around 7:15 pm on a Friday night (8/7/15).  We even ordered one of the specials for $2.99 on the back of the flyer to try. They have flyers at the register too. Great Customer service, food was hot and made to order. Very squeaky clean.  Love their open patio, it's very nice place and reasonably priced. Cheap eats.The menu is chaotic: gyros and burritos and salads and kabobs, not to mention the namesake philly steaks. But the kabobs aren't available in steak and the gyros aren't available in lamb. But they do currently have a well-priced salmon kabob special ($11).Considering the very mixed reviews for the phillys, I opted for salads here. The gyro salad was a handful of lettuce, three strips of meat, and three or four cucumber and tomato pieces. The takeout box was half empty. The additional Greek salad my friend ordered had no feta. Seriously? Restaurant is a walkup counter. Large patio for outdoor seating. Prices are low. A guy dining in exclaimed that he was from Philadelphia and the food was rockin'. I'm underwhelmed enough with the salads to be disinterested in trying more options. YMMV.
PAN=Sigh. Last night could've been great. Though the company was wonderful, our collective experience at Pan was not. Our party of six arrived early last night, but were taken before our reservation without any trouble. As it turned out, the dining room was empty, save for the tables outside, so a reservation likely wasn't necessary to begin with (just a tip in case you plan on going). Our server was hyper-friendly and took our drink and food orders quickly. All but one of us took advantage of Pan's awesome Restaurant Week special - a Bowl and a Roll for $20.15.  It seemed too good to be true. We started with the Rolls, each chosen from their delectable menu of maki.  I chose the Key Lime roll complete with scallops and spicy tuna.  Among our party there was a Dragon roll (eel, tempura something, etc.), a Green roll (vegetarian), and one roll that just couldn't make it to the table for some reason. We waited. And waited some more. Finally, I dug into my roll, all the while giving my friend the "I'm sorry" side-eye. My roll was absolutely delicious.  His arrived well after we all finished, with little explanation.  The server did mention there was a delay shortly after we received our orders, but after that, he didn't say much else.  Finally, the roll arrived and we chalked it up to newbie Restaurant Week jitters. Next up were our order of Bowls. I opted for the Drunken Noodle bowl (more scallops and wide noodles), while the others chose a variety from Pan's good-lookin' bowl menu. Five bowls arrived, but not the sixth. Are you kidding? Though the guest in question kept his cool I was close to busting my chopsticks over my knee and storming out. I didn't, and ate my bowl in quiet frustration instead. It was okay. The bowl reports across the board were that they were bland, so "roll" all the way if you decide to visit Pan.  After at least 15 minutes, the final bowl arrived and the server admitted it was his fault. Thanks, but too little too late. His meal was comped, his drinks weren't and we all left with very little chance of ever returning.  Hopefully, these issues are just a flash in the "Pan," for all you Yelpers out there, but I won't be among you. There are too many other great options in this amazing city.P.S. The new layout in the dining room leaves a lot to be desired. I wasn't obsessed with Tamari, but at least they had a nice collection of booths and tables. If I want one long picnic table I'll go to the park.I miss Tamari a lot, so I had to check out what PAN was all about. Two friends and I had dinner here at 9pm on a Saturday night. Wasn't crowded at all. We shared the Angry Snapper sushi roll and all liked it a lot. It's perfect for those who can handle just a little bit of spicy, but might be slightly disappointing for those who are expecting a lot of spicy. We were almost going to order seconds, but decided to save room for our entrees. I got the braised pork belly, which my friends thought was really good. I thought it was alright; couldn't eat too much of it for some reason, probably because I wasn't a fan of the butternut squash it was served over. If it had ginger in it, the taste was too strong. If there was no ginger in it, then I have no idea what it was. (I know there was cinnamon and nutmeg in it though because that's what the chef said.) One of my friends got the pan pho and said the broth and meat were bad but noodles were good. The other had the drunken noodles and said they were good but too salty. When we were ready for dessert and inquired about the menu, we were disappointed to hear from our server that she didn't have anything for us. Well...okay. Not even an explanation of why no dessert was available? Awkward end to our meal. Awkward end to this review. (I'd much prefer Tamari.)Taste | 3Atmosphere | 3Presentation | 4Service | 3.5OVERALL | 3
Zoës Kitchen=I'm so excited Zoës is closer to me now. Today is the grand opening and it was a little busy around noon, but it was flowing nicely. They are giving away cups for your drink and you can get free refills for the month. I ordered the chicken kabob with the Greek salad and a side of quinoa (new item) it was good!  I also had a side of the hummus. Can't wait to come back.
Chickpeas Mediterranean Cafe=Officially open September 1st, Chickpeas is the newest Mediterranean spot in Vegas. Food is fresh and flavorful, and there's covered patio seating.  Menu has all the usual favorites: shwarma, tabouli, hummus, pita. Meats are available as plates, sandwiches, or (allegedly) on salads. They also offer breakfast.I was thrilled to see Oliviet (Russian potato salad) on the menu! Unfortunately they were out of it on my most recent visit. Menu has no clear appetizers section- cashier had some difficulty adding a small order of falafel, as the menu only offers it as a plate or sandwich. Ordering "Greek salad with chicken shwarma" got me a side salad and a shwarma wrap, which isn't what I had in mind (salad topped with meat).Ordering issues and new-opening kinks aside, the space is clean and organized. The falafel is soft and flavorful inside, but could be a bit crisper on the outside. It came with an ample portion of tahini sauce. The greek salad was tasty (heads up that it's pre-dressed) and the veggies were fresh. The shwarma wrap was nicely seasoned, and had a good amount of tomatoes and red onion, and a generous portion of meat. Unfortunately, the pita itself was falling apart before we were halfway though, which got messy.
Go Vegan Cafe=Someone once said "No one chooses to go to Denny's, they just end up there."  I somehow ended up at a restaurant serving raw vegan.  Hey!  They don't have to cook any of it!  This should come out quick! haaaaaWhen I used to live in NYC, there was a semi well known "Juice Bar" on St Mark's for a while that was a front for selling illegal things.  Walking into this pretty empty space totally reminded me of that.  Aside from the salad bar in the center of the relatively big room, one would be hard pressed to tell if the restaurant was coming or going.  There was a sushi display case at the rear counter from probably like 4 businesses ago and a bar on the right that looked like it hadn't seen a patron in years.  With its basement type ambiance, Go Vegan Café is clearly a takeout type eatery.  I doubt a person that lives this type of lifestyle cares about any of that since a lack of vegan options in the neighborhood would totally supersede atmosphere.The "Raw Portobello Burger" with its nut patty (made with almonds, sunflower seeds, sun-dried tomatoes, ginger, & carrots) was better than expected.  The creaminess of the almond "cheese" and avocado made for a more than passable garden sandwich.  The onion rawtilla bun wasn't flimsy at all and held everything together nicely.  The "fries" were simply 3 slices of breaded avocado hmmmm. My wife liked her "Veggie Wrap" which was basically a reshaped salad as collard greens were used as the tortilla.  The house slaw that came with her dish with its unique dressing was the tastiest thing we had.  Two dishes and veggie juice came out to $37, yet both of us were still hungry later.  Wanting to stay consistent with the whole raw evening, I ate a couple of bananas later on.  There's really no rush for me to return, but if I find myself on one of those beefx5 kind of weeks, this would be a good way to change up the eating cycle.Even if the raw vegan lifestyle isn't for you, the food here is fresh, fun, great tasting, and good for you! Plus it's the best kind of takeout ever, since you don't have to worry about it getting cold. ;)There are "raw" and just vegan items available- the raw burgers (portabello on nut patty!) and collard wraps (mexican and italian-style!) are my favorites though, both served with avocado "fries". If you want a liquid lunch, they have a massive selection of smoothies and shakes, as well as fresh young coconuts.Location is a bit odd: you cash out at the hostess stand rather than the back bakery counter or the large ground counter where the staff sit. There's a huge salad bar ($9/lb) in the middle of the dining room with a small supplement shop area to the right, and the "small talk garden" area to the back. There's just a lot going on and not much in the way of decor. I guess all their focus and energy are busy in the kitchen!I am not a Vegan by any stretch of the imagination, so my knowledge of this foodie world is lacking, with that being said, I found the food here to be very flavorful and filling. Walking-in it's very plain on the inside, looking like a half finished school cafeteria with a small grocery section selling vegan or vegetarian products. I sat down and realized I was the only person in here, which can be creepy. The menu is overwhelming, as there's a lot to choose from, to make matters worse, I wasn't really given any guidance on how to tackle it, so I went with the Lentil Loaf sandwich and the Roasted Veggie quesadilla. The Lentil Loaf was good, but a little on the dry side. It needed some type of sauce to moisten it up. The menu said it comes with BBQ sauce, but there was little to no sauce on this sammie. This was very filling and if you're looking for heavy meal, this is a good option. The Roasted Veggie Quesadilla had a lot more flavor, but it was greasy! Like needing to wash my hands after every bite, greasy. There was cheese on this, dairy free cheese, and to be honest, the difference wasn't ultra noticeable and I actually liked it. The roasted veggies still had a snap to them and a little heat that slowly escalated with every bite. Good stuff!The design and the service here needs a huge upgrade, I only received one glass of water, which I had to ask for and was checked on only twice during the entire meal. Go Vegan needs to work on these things if they want to prosper in their not so great location.
Therapy=I'm excited about this new place! So far based on the two drinks I had, the service, and the environment, this place is getting 5 stars! Grabbed drinks here while waiting for a table at Le Thai, and our experience was delightful. We sat at the bar and perused the cocktail menu. There were so many interesting, scrumptious sounding drinks to try, but I went with the Piña Colada, my favorite. This one had a particular appeal because it included banana liquor, which I thought would be a nice touch. My husband ordered the Smash. Both of the drinks were so unique and refreshing. Not super sweet and not super heavy. Very light, delicate flavors and very beautifully presented (see photos for presentation obviously). The service was great. Our bartender was very friendly and willing to answer all questions about the menu and was just an all around cool person. He had a lot to share with us about the chef, the inspired food and drinks and just regular human conversations. As we were walking by the window of the restaurant a few hours later, he waved at us. The fact that he remembered us is huge for me. When I worked in the restaurant business it was rare that I could remember a person. But he did. It means a lot to be treated like new friends than just customers. Piña Colada: I love this drink. I am always ordering Piñas and this one was very different from the Las Vegas poolside original. It was not super sweet and didn't feel like I was drinking a milkshake (which is a good thing in this case). The banana liquor added a different dimension to the drink and gave it an added tropical feeling. They finished it off with some shredded coconut on top, and i think there was some in the bottom of my drink as well, which was a nice surprise at the end. All in all, I really loved it. The Smash: This one has all the things my husband loves "smashed" into one glass. The fresh blackberries muddled in the bottom of the glass with fresh mint leaves creates a refreshing, light, sweet combo. Its almost like an adult blackberry lemonade. It is one of the fan favorites so far. My husband loved it as well. We didn't have a chance to try the food yet, but I took a glance at the menu and there are about a million things on there that I would LOVE to order. So I will be back and add to this review, for sure!Joining a growing list of DTLV eateries, Therapy. has some inventive dishes and new takes on others.  Items served:Oxtail empanadas with lime crème fraîcheSoft pretzel bread with spicy beer mustardIn the "gnudi"Roasted Mexican street cornAssorted mushroom flatbread with smoked bacon, caramelized onion and soft cooked eggRed velvet waffle slidersHangar steak tartarCrispy fried pig ears with truffle honey mustard sauceRoasted cauliflower with dates and yellow curryCast iron s'mores with semi-sweet chocolate and bacon marshmallowsCrumbled carrot cakeGreeted by the general manager, Chuck Scimeca, we were quickly seated and brought water and I ordered an iced tea.  We were asked if we wanted to order items from the menu or have the chef send out items he chose.  After looking at the menu, we opted for them to make the choices for us but we had a few requests--items they had already planned for us to have.  During our dinner, Chef Daniel Ontiveros, formerly at Comme Ça, came to the table to talk about some of the dishes and his plans for the menu in the future.  I saw him several times stopping at tables to chat with customers.Outstanding dishes were the gnudi--baked ricotta, truffle honey, fig jam, roasted almonds & cranberry and walnut crostini.  The jam and almonds with the baked cheese on the crostini was excellent!  The Mexican street corn was very good.  I'll go for this anytime.  The assorted mushroom flatbread was very different.  Instead of being a standard flatbread crust, it was instead a puff pastry crust.  The char on the pastry was perfect without being burnt.  The soft cooked egg mixed onto the flatbread added to the flavor of the mushrooms and bacon.  The last two items were ones we asked for and were good choices.  The baked cauliflower with China Ranch dates and yellow curry was excellent!  The light curry flavor was very good.  Finally, the pig ears were so much different than others I've had.  These were meatier instead of being a thin slice of pig ear.  The honey mustard dipping sauce with them was very tasty.The two desserts were quite good.  The s'mores with bacon marshmallows on top of a graham cracker crust in the cast iron container was a fun dish--a perfect example of Chef Ontiveros's slant on a dish that's available in area restaurants--this with a very different twist.  The favorite, however, was the crumbled carrot cake served with cream cheese frosting and a spoon of vanilla ice cream.Service during the evening was excellent.  My iced tea was replaced with a fresh glass before I  was done with the previous and the servers were all pleasant and efficient.  One negative for me--the music was loud at times and it almost overwhelmed our conversation.  Therapy. is very close to being a five star review. We were not presented a check.  The servers were taken care of instead.Therapy. has been open for just over a month and things are running very smoothly.  It was with a very full stomach that we walked back to the garage where we'd parked.  I'll be back to Therapy. soon!Recently opened in the white-hot Fremont East district, an interesting decision given the established gastro-pub offerings of Park, Glutton, Carson Kitchen and more, it was at the suggestion of two trusted palates that dinner at "Therapy." was booked, the menu seemingly featuring all the right words with execution left to Chef Daniel Ontiveros in his debut role as head toque in a restaurant off The Strip.Long in layout and two-stories tall, the space formerly inhabited by a Dollar Store completely renovated with a sexy bar and exposed ceilings as an open kitchen operates towards the back, it was at the hostess stand that we met the GM and swiftly led to a tidy four-top at the center of the restaurant the option of dining a la carte or letting the Chef cook for the table was offered, the later obviously accepted with a few special requests.Admittedly allowing a friend of the house to arrange the reservation, and unexpectedly presented with no check at night's end, it was with service proving not only friendly but exceedingly well-informed and efficient that the meal began; a plate of soft pretzels set beside a quartet of oxtail empanadas, the former unequivocally buttery and luscious while the latter found surprising levity when dipped in peppery crème fraîche.Sipping a stiff yet fruity frozen drink, and later treated to a tasting of signature sangrias from which the Elder-Melon iteration proved an on-point summer refresher, it was with good pacing that round two arrived a few minutes after opening plates were finished and although the citrus kissed street corn was certainly no slouch there is little sense arguing that the star of the show was in fact the absolutely irresistible ricotta dumplings entitled "in the gnudi," a gooey bite both sweet and savory that wows equally when eaten like gnocchi or spread on crostini, an item already rivaling the best appetizers in the city and a midpoint contender for the year's ten best bites.At this point seeing lights lowered as a pop-heavy soundtrack switched to Taylor Swift at a volume that seemed a bit unnecessary given the growing din of the crowd, it was onward to a flaky puff-pastry 'flatbread' topped with mushrooms and a soft-poached egg that the savories marched on, and with a shocking degree of smoke imbued in the crust given the use of an electric oven each slice was slowly savored, a follow-up jar of silky steak tartar on par with what should be expected while the whimsical red-velvet sliders were unfortunately a bit muddled by all the accoutrements, a bit less slaw or more brine to the bird needed to add balance while the 'bun' would have been better off crisp.At this point a bit full, but unable to resist tasting a few more savories before moving onto dessert, it was with good fortune that a request was made to sample the meatiest pig's ears tasted to date, and yet as delicious as the indulgent strips were it was perhaps a bit of a surprise that the charred yellow cauliflower presented even bolder, the use of curry, dates, as well as nuts offering a great degree of balance and giving one hope of great things to come when Ontiveros launches a market-driven blackboard in the months to come.Told that sweets at Therapy. are something not to be missed it was after a short visit from the Chef that the meal would reach its end, and again treated to a duo one would be hard pressed to decide whether the cast iron s'mores or deconstructed carrot cake was better, each creamy spoonful of the first exceptionally decadent despite being nicely anchored by a graham cracker base while the crumbled semicircle of spice cake was unquestionably more elegant, each bite offering something slightly different when paired to ice cream and airy cream cheese.Still new, but already executing at a high level from the kitchen to the front of house staff, Therapy. marks yet another success for East Fremont, an area where things may indeed seem 'same-same' on the surface, while a deeper shows Chefs like Ontiveros instead pushing new concepts in an attempt to evolve the scene, and perhaps even swing the pendulum away from the strip and thereby change the game.Cool lounge with some quality food, nice spot for something new on Fremont. It was too early in the day to drink, so I popped in for some apps: the Social Club portion of the menu is tapas-style but the portion sizes don't really lend themselves to much in the way of sharing.OXTAIL EMPANADAS: Delightful outer shell, great flavor on the actual oxtail, but it was a bit on the dry side. Those corner bites where the grease and juices collected were pretty great, though. This was served with a harissa-lime crème fraiche dipping sauce that had more color than flavor and did not add anything to the flavors of the dish itself. HANGAR STEAK TARTARE: A passable classic version, but not one of the better ones in town. Good selection of pickled veggies, four crisp slices of grilled bread, and a reasonable portion, but not something I'd necessarily get again.Even with just the two dishes I tried, the menu shows some promise. I'll have to come back with a few friends to try more, particularly the In the Gnudi, as my dining partner this visit is unable to eat ricotta. Service was friendly and attentive without being pushy, bartender was happy to suggest a few of her favorite dishes.It's just bar food, but good bar food. There are many options in Vegas for an "upscale" bar food experience, but sadly most of these spots fall pretty short when it comes to delivery. Therapy isn't reinventing the wheel here, but they are making a better, tastier, and more attractive place to hang with friends. The location is great, smack dab in the middle of a bustling Downtown Las Vegas great for both tourist and locals alike. I came here after attending the Las Vegas Film Festival and instantly loved the decor and flow of this place. There are no walls in the place, you can literally see into the bar, kitchen, and upstairs dining area from anywhere on the lower level. My guest and I weren't super hungry so we went with a smattering shareable food items found on the, "Social Club" menu section. The Oxtail Empanadas, The Chicken Meatballs, Roasted Curry Cauliflower and Mixed mushroom Flatbread. From the best to the not so best... The Oxtail Empanadas, our server Georgie suggested these amazing little pockets of tender meat. Lite crispy pouches filled to the brim with slowed cooked shredded meat, a must order! Thanks Georgie! The Mixed Mushroom Flatbread. Mushrooms, truffle oil, cheese, all on flattened puff pastry. This was a little heavy on the truffle oil, but was still very tasty. I really enjoyed the bacon cut into cubes rather than diced strips. Comes with a soft boiled egg for all that runny goodness! Roasted Cauliflower. Solid curry flavor especially when paired with dates. Cooked perfect with a light snap as you bit into them. The Chicken meatballs were just ok. They were a tad bland and dry, so thank goodness it came with a cilantro pesto. I pretty much had to drown the meatball in this tasty sauce. This might be a one-time thing so maybe I'll try this on my next visit. This place is definitely worth a try even if you just pop in for a quick cocktail and snack.My anxiety can only be cured by food. What better place to get that taken care of that than Therapy. The diners are your typical local downtown hipsters. The service was good.The decription of menu items seemed all so delicious. We gave a few items a try...In the "Gnudi":Fig jam, baked ricotta, truffle honey, roasted almonds, arugula on cranberry walnut crostini. They look like takoyaki with grilled bread on the side. Different textures and flavors in a simple dish. Sweetness from the fig jam and honey, the peppery taste from the arugula, the smokey flavor from the grilled crostini, the mild taste and creaminess from the ricotta, and the crunch from the almonds. 4/5Oxtail Empanadas:Empanadas filled with oxtail with lime creme fraiche. Split the empanada in half to release the steam from the hot and juicy oxtail pieces then dip in creme fraiche. I just wish there was more of the tasty filling. 3.5/5Chicken and Red Velvet Waffle Slider:Crispy chicken breast with a red pepper remoulade in between red velvet Belgian waffles, with syrup on the side. The chicken itself was nice and crunchy without being heavy on the batter. The remoulade adds heat and tang but the sweet syrup with a hint of alcohol balances it out. I tried to eat this with my hands but the waffles weren't stable enough to hold the heavy chicken and the wet remoulade. Definitely eat with a fork and knife. 4/5The French Dip:Roasted prime beef, horseradish cream on a grilled hoagie with truffle chips on the side. I haven't had a good beef sandwich in this country since I moved out of the MidWest. The jus is more like a gravy as it's thicker than your average jus but honestly, you won't even need it. The truffle chips were amazing. They weren't oily and they were freshly-made. They definitely taste like truffles. 5/5I wanted to give the Roasted Jidori Chicken, Shrimp Scampi, and Filet Frites a try but I guess I would have to come back for more Therapy.When comparing the hot triple threat of New American eats in DTLV, Therapy reluctantly gets the bronze medal by a few tenths of a point.  It's still worthy, offering things the others don't, like cozier seating, a nice sized bar, and the only place on the block with big TV's for sports.  But despite a few interesting menu twists, their dishes either match similarly in quality to their competitors or fall a bit short, but never really surpass.         The "Crispy Fried Pig Ears" are presented like a bride's bouquet at a high end redneck wedding.  This group friendly dish came a lot crispier with less breading on my most recent visit, which I felt to be not as good as my initial time; it still magically disappeared though.  The truffle honey mustard dipping sauce is kind of gross, so I just eat them straight, preferably with a large glass of Hamm's.  Another great partner with beer is "Popcorn".  The fried peanuts and maple candied bacon make for wonderful companions, but sharing this with actual companions is slightly awkward since you'll basically be eating bits that were touched, but unsuccessfully attempted to be picked up, by others when diving in for their handful.  I wanted chopsticks!  A bigger bowl with a mini shovel would work better.  I'd like a couple of hits of whatever the chef was smoking when he thought of this one.   The "Chicken and Red Velvet Waffle Slider" is an eye catcher with all its color, but a crispier waffle would have made for a functional sandwich instead of sloppiness on a plate.  The fried chicken itself was crispy and very juicy.  I would have been down with just a bucket of that.  Definitely worth returning for, but I'll be eating this all deconstructed with a fork and knife next time.One dish to be avoided is the "Roasted Cauliflower".  The extreme char masked any signs of seasoning.  That place on Carson that starts with a "G" does an incredible version of this.  Get the excellent "Street Corn" instead or save the extra bucks (and room) for one of Therapy's great desserts like carrot cake or smores.  3.7623235799213 stars.It's neat to see what Therapy has become, especially considering where it started. What used to be a complete dump of a horrible tourist gift shop is now one of the nicer lounge type restaurants in the area. Not only does Therapy have a full bar if you're looking to just stop in for a drink, but there are dining areas both downstairs and upstairs. It's another great example of the revitalization of downtown.Our first visit here was a somewhat short one. We had just finished dinner around the corner, and decided to stop in for a drink. Alongside a handful of beers on tap, they have a few signature cocktails and house-made sangrias. For the ridiculously hot days in Vegas, they even offer some frozen drinks. I decided to give The Smash! a shot after hearing good things about it, but unfortunately wasn't a huge fan. The bourbon was there, but not much of it and completely masked by the blackberry and sweetened lime. On our next visit, we sat down with a party of about 10 and ordered up about as much as we could on the menu. Much like the direction many new restaurants are taking, Therapy has two sections of the menu called "The Social Club" and "Bites" which focus on shareable plates. Of the 15 items between the two sections, we ended up ordering 10 of them.A few things that stood out for me were the Chicken & Red Velvet Waffle Sliders, Shrimp Ceviche and the Hangar Steak Tartar. The chicken and waffle sliders are actually pretty big and if ordered alone could probably be a dinner for some. I liked the large, juicy piece of chicken and the mild sweetness from the waffle. It also has a spicy remoulade that adds a nice little kick. And while the ceviche was real heavy on the tomato flavor, but mild on the citrus, I still enjoyed it. It was fresh, bright and flavorful. As far as the tartar goes, I think i was one of the few at our table who enjoyed it. I haven't had tartar at many restaurants, but I liked the seasoning in addition to the egg and crispy grilled bread. We didn't order a whole lot from the larger plates, but we did have a couple items that are worth mentioning. The Charred Kale is an excellent salad that was really one of the top items of the night. It had amazing flavor and I loved both the fresh egg and bacon smoked bacon vinaigrette topping it. Another surprising favorite was The French Dip. This sandwich is not the typical dry bread, low quality meat and oily ju that you find almost everywhere else. The flavors were spot on, the meat was tender and juicy, and the sandwich as a whole just had the right amount of heat from the horseradish. It's also served with crispy chips that have a present, but deliciously addicting truffle flavor. To finish out the night, we ordered 3 out of their 4 desserts. The Cast Iron Smores was crazy sweet, and could definitely benefit from a little more bacon to offset that. Both the Crumbled Carrot Cake and Pure Decadence chocolate cake were much better, but still probably not something I'd order again. I did really enjoy the brown butter ice cream though that was on the carrot cake, and would probably order that alone if it was offered.Because we ordered nearly 20 items from the menu and only a few were things I'd come back for, I don't think I'd rush back. We also had less than stellar service. For whatever reason, our waiter forgot to put in an order of the Cheddar Mac & Cheese, which was something quite a few of our party was anticipating. She admitted to forgetting it, but after asking her to still put the order in, she either forgot again, or blew it off. This was basically towards the end of our meal too, and we had already asked for it twice before that. Shortly after, we watched another table next to us get an order of it, then our table was cleaned off and she started asking about dessert. Luckily she remembered to take it off the bill, but it was still frustrating to miss a dish that was asked for multiple times.After 2 visits, I'm still a bit torn on Therapy. They've definitely got a lot to offer, and it's another great addition to the "New Downtown", but some things just fall a little short to bump this up to 4 stars.Went here for a lunch outing with a company I worked for during the summer. It was a few days after Therapy opened in July. I drove by Therapy this morning and was reminded of my awful experience and felt compelled to share. I walked by Therapy a few weeks before the lunch outing and heard Dead Kennedys' "California Uber Alles" blaring from their doorstep at 11 a.m., so I had a positive initial impression. Our party of close to two dozen was seated at a long table in the back. The decor was wood and metal and the kitchen was open which added to the homey, comfortable vibe. Two waitresses were taking care of us. I looked through the menu with my vegan lenses and narrowed it down to three items; a salad, a flatbread or a side. I wanted something filling with a variety of flavors so I decided on the summer squash flatbread and ordered it without cheese. I informed the waitress upon ordering that I cannot have meat or dairy and she said she was nearly certain my order would suit my needs, but if there was an issue she would let me know.The entrees came out and the waitress informed me the dough for the flatbread contained dairy. Since the entrees had already arrived, I asked her what other menu items I could have. She frantically looked at the menu for a few minutes and suggested the mixed greens salad without Parmesan. I didn't want to waste any more time so I agreed. I was pretty disappointed since I was looking forward to something filling and toothsome. I remembered I had stashed a trusty and incredibly tasty Trader Joe's $3.99 vegan BBQ chicken wrap in the fridge at work the day before so I was less annoyed since I wouldn't have to be hungry for the rest of the work day. The salad was the most pathetic plate I've seen in a while. Half the plate was empty and the salad was dressed spring mix and a few radish slices. The owner came by after I had a few bites and asked the group which dishes everyone enjoyed. People replied with this and that and he asked one of my coworkers what he thought of the mac and cheese. "I'm lactose intolerant so I couldn't try it," he replied. The owner said with a chuckle, "Well you don't matter." I saw a few people look my way and the owner quickly walked away from the awkward silence after his comment. I was taken aback and frankly insulted that a restaurant owner in downtown Las Vegas would say that customers who can't eat dairy don't matter. Even as a joke. The absence of vegan items, besides some overpriced spring mix, made a lot more sense after his comment. By no means do I think they need to do a menu overhaul. The dishes that came out looked very creative and fun (like the red velvet waffles and chicken), but in a neighborhood where you can get various dairy-free lattes, vegan nachos, vegan pizza and vegan donuts asserting people who can't have dairy don't matter is asinine.It's unfortunate that Daniel Ontiveros left, but if the new executive chef can lead the kitchen as well as his predecessor, Therapy will continue to be a quality spot Downtown and is already one of the most beautiful spaces in the area. They spent a pretty penny on this build out and the quality shows. More upscale than surrounding restaurants but still a casual environment perfect for hanging out with friends or for a date night. I stopped by a couple times earlier in the summer and both visits showcased well crafted dishes where the smaller, shareable plates shined. They have some classic dishes like steak tartare made with hangar steak and chicken and waffles using crisp and airy red velvet waffles. Latin inspired dishes can be found on the menu. Street corn charred and smothered with cheese, a lime aioli and a subtle kick from chili peppers makes for some good bites. As do savory, rich, and slightly oily oxtail empanadas or an order of shrimp ceviche and chips.The most successful items were also the most unique. Fried pig ears were a first for me, but I walked away a fan of its crispy exterior and chewy (almost like biting into a fig) texture. Their "In the gnudi" dish was also a hit. Although slightly sweet with a fig jam and cranberries, spreading the baked ricotta and topping on top of the accompanying walnut crostini created an enticing array of tastes and textures.Both flatbreads I tried -- the summer squash and mixed mushroom flatbreads -- were equally outstanding where the buttery, flakey pastry-like crust stood out as the star of both dishes.The biggest letdowns were the limp popcorn and salty and dry chicken meatballs. Aside from those missteps I'd have to say that Therapy has lots of promise, provided that the changes in the kitchen don't hold them back.
Rotana=I am so glad that Rotana is open! I love their selection of food. Not many places to get Lebanese or Armenian dishes. The hummus with chicken shawarma is fantastic. I love the mixed grill with lamb, chicken kabob, and kafta.The Labna dip has a hint of spice, it pairs well with any meat. The rice is good. Comparable to most other places. It was fresh. I ordered takeout 3 nights in a row. No complaints, my order was correct, it was a normal wait time, and each item was a good sized portion to generous.It has been remodeled inside. Only one large booth, the rest are tables. 2 patios to enjoy this gorgeous autumn weather. They have many flavors of shisha for hookah enthusiasts. There is an area for live music inside as well, ask for details. Looks like a full bar too. Currently offering a yelp deal. Healthy choices for kids meals also. I'll be back many times.Happy hour- appetizers 3pm-6 or 7pm, I only glanced at the sign. To be updated.How do I write this review without sounding so cliche?How do I avoid using those annoying phrases like "to die for" and "the best ever"?How can I say my words without an over use of exclamation points? (My grammar teacher will snap the ruler against my knuckles!)Well if I can't say it, give me a canvas so I can paint a picture.You know that feeling when you have a good thing going? You want to capture THAT exactly as it is and not have one iota change. Well...I want this restaurant to stay open always. I want that chef to be there forever.I don't want the menu to change ever.Folks at the table were humming with joy and shimmying to the middle eastern music coming from the wide screens. I, myself, wanted to crawl into the basket of warm pita bread and hibernate there for the winter. And let me tell you neither a beggar nor borrower I be, but for this review I'm begging you to borrow some cash and support this wonderful restaurant, Rotana. It's Located on Greenway Parkway just past 7th Street and across the drive thru of Wells Fargo. In all honesty, this is the best Mediterranean food I've eaten. It's to die for!Whew.There are multiple veggie options on the menu (full color and pictorial) and although most of them are listed as appetizers, you can easily make a meal out of two items and leave satiated. The dishes we ordered were simple but deliciously filled with an abundance of incredible flavor. Everything tasted as if it had been made-to-order. I think there was a solo operation going on in the kitchen because our plates came out one at a time. But it's all for one and one for all at our table so even though sharing the first dish was obligatory, as other plates arrived and covered the table in goodness we were all happily chomping on our own dishes and finished eating around the same time. Here's what the vegetarians ordered:Hummus - $5.50Yummy, creamy. Just fancied up with a topping of whole chickpeas, olive oil, and flavor. Baba Ghanouj - $6.50The menu says "smoked to perfection" and I wholeheartedly agree. The eggplant was perfectly smooth, tasty, topped with tomato garnish, olive oil, and flavor.M'jadara - $5.00Lentils with rice, topped with crispy onions and flavor.Normally I would not have liked this dish because the rice was mushy combined with the texture of the lentils, but it was delicious. I actually dug in and ate a few spoonfuls. If you like beans and rice, order it.Roasted brussels sprouts - $5.00Tossed with cranberries. Not crunchy, yet firm. Yeh to firm green veggies. I was impressed with the melange. Muhammara - $5.50My first time hearing of this dish. It's a red pepper paste mixed with walnuts. The menu claimed "spicy red pepper" and although one person at the table tasted some heat, all I got was a mouthful of saltiness. Too salty for my taste, but I liked it paired with the m'jadara and brussels sprouts. Fattoush rotana salad - $7.00Wow. This salad was the most complicated looking dish on the table. Like a kaleidoscope - purple, orange, red, all shades of greens, there may have been yellow too. Piled with several ingredients and topped with fried pita, flavorful dressing, and some delicious seasoning that I've never tasted before. I. Wanted. To. Lick. The. Salad. Are you hearing me?Lick. It.Falafel - $6.00Thankfully the fritters were not oily, but unfortunately their texture was dry and uneventful. If there exists a falafel spectrum in the universe, it must only read "dry" on one end and "oily" on the opposite end with nothing in-between because I've only had falafel either dry or oily. Haven't found a restaurant yet that has found a balance. Skip it.Vegetarian burger - $6.00An overgrown falafel in burger clothes. Normally that would be okay, but this falafel was dry, so unless you like it like that, skip it.
El Rancho Mexican Grill=It's quick.  It's cheap.  And let's be honest.  They finally did something with a long standing vacant building.When you walk in, you order at the counter where they make your food assembly style to order.  I stopped in last Friday and walked away with a carnitas torta.  The carnitas were full of pork goodness and tender to the bite.  Topped with your choice of toppings and under $8, it was a solid lunch.It was a hard sell for me since my favorite Mexican spot is right down the street, but Both of my stops here have been great and I will definitely be coming back for more. The staff is extremely friendly, the food has tons of flavor, great portions, and the cheese sauce and spicy onions are ridiculous.
Pita Pit=Fresh, fast Mediterranean style food. I can't say I'd choose this spot over table service, but it seems good enough for a quick stop or a lunch. You tell them what you want, double meat? There's an option for that, top it with hummus, tatziki, jalapeños, peprocini, cucumber and more. They cater too. I'd stop in again if I lived or worked in the area :-)Happy yelping! ... Gilbert, Mesa, or wherever I am. ;-)
Smoke's Poutinerie=I'm not from the Great White North and I've only had a few Americanized versions of poutine- I wouldn't know if the version served here is legit or not. But I can tell you that it is good.The snack-size traditional poutine is amply sized and priced ($6) for the name, and comes with fresh, skin-on fries topped with layers of fresh cheese curds and a splash of gravy. I do like that they layered the toppings so the bottom half of the order was not dry and boring. The fries were sauced just right so they were nicely soft but not soggy. Flavor in the gravy itself was lighter than expected but still savory and enjoyable.Props for having vegetarian options available! I'd opt to stick to the namesake traditional poutine dish here over others, because the rest of the menu contains cheese-fry, chili-fry, and taco-themed concoctions that seem more on par with a bar or fast food restaurant.
Lili.Co=There are so many restaurants in Montreal that I wish to check out but sadly I don't have enough time (or frankly money if we are being truthful). For the part 3 years, the October-November event of MTL à Table has allowed me to get to certain restaurants at a reduced price which I am very thankfully for. When I first looked at the restaurants participating this year, the one that leaped off the page for me was Lili Co. Originally a small Plateau restaurant, partners Catherine Draws and David Pellizzari moved into a bigger space on Saint-Laurent earlier this year. Reading the big reviews they have gotten over the past few years - including a most recent one in the Gazette in July - Lili Co.'s use of offal and off-cuts really intrigued me and had me pinning for a visit. Sadly, the MTL à Table menu didn't have any of that - unless you paid a little extra - but I still wanted to go and give them a try.Visually, Lili Co. is a nice clean space. The main focus is on the two wrap-around bars which circle both the bar area and the open kitchen where you can watch Chef David and his crew do their work. In fact, outside of a few spots - including where we were sadly! - the entire room is set up to face the kitchen. Service was quick and efficient. Noise level was pretty loud given the room was full. As such, there was background music throughout the night but I honestly couldn't tell you what it was. It is not the most fancy room around but sharp nevertheless.I felt like a cocktail this evening so I tried one of their seasonal specialities - The "Sans nom d'automne" - zubrowska, cachaca, natural apple juice, teapot bitters and star anise. I like this one in theory but the flavour left me indifferent. The sweetness of the cachaca and the apple juice were not noticeable. I was left primarily with the bitterness and the zubrowska - not really I had hoped for.With the cocktail consumed, we moved on the food. First up was the pork belly served with cashew butter and creamy coleslaw. A generous peace of fatty pork with a nice crispiness to the skin. The creamy coleslaw paired well with the meat. The cashew butter was nice as well.Our other starter was wild mushrooms poached in butter served with caramelized cauliflower purée and black bread crumbs. A simple dish but so well executed and delicious. The mushrooms were soften slightly with their wonderful earthiness intact. The real star though was the cauliflower puree - so rich and smooth. Very enjoyable.Our second course started with Gnocchi à la fajiole served with romano beans, smoked tomatoes and parmigiana. A nice creamy sauce paired well with the pillowy gnocchi and the beans. Only complaint would be the portion size - definitely would have been nice to have a few extra gnocchi!The second main was grilled octopus with a hibiscus glaze, chorizo, soy beans, black olive powder and lemon. The hit of the evening for us. The mixture of the glaze and the chorizo gave the tender octopus a hint of both sweetness and spiciness. The soy beans added a little extra sustenance to the plate. Definitely a dish I would order again.For dessert, we were treated to house doughnuts with lemon mousse and huckleberry jam. The doughnuts were light and fluffy in the inside with a nice crunch on the outside. Add the sugar coating to the jam and the mousse and you have a nice dessert right there. The final dessert was a brioche with a nut beurre monté, sumac and a wild flower glace au miel. Just like the doughnuts, the brioche was nice and fluffy. The special touches of the beurre monté and the glace au miel provided some nice sweetness and richness.I'll admit I was disappointed that no offal or off-cut dishes were present in the menu option - since that is what attracted me to Lili Co in the first place - but in the end, that is on me for having waiting until MTL à Table to finally visit Lili Co. The food was excellent and the atmosphere enjoyable - you can see why they needed to move into bigger digs this year. This meal simply reinforced that I will need to come back again. Looking forward to visiting chef David and Catherine on a more regular occasion.Cheers!
Freiburg Gastropub=When you walk in to Freiburg, it feels like you are walking into a set for a german themed movie.  The interior feels gimmicky and tries way too hard on being "German".  And quite honestly, the same can be said about the food.  Yes, they use German words for their entrees.  Yes, they feature German beers.  But the execution of the dishes falls flat, real flat.  Let's start with the beer.  I am impressed with the variety and options featured but not impressed with the glassware used.  Yes, it's branded to the beer you are drinking but their sizes are laughable.  If you have "pub" in your name, bust out the steins or Maß glasses.For food, we ordered the kasesspatzle and the rinderbraten.  The former is basically Freiburg's play on mac and cheese.  The spaetzle was gummy and came off oily.  The rinderbraten (roast beef and gravy) was ho hum.  The roast beef was not tough but not exactly fall apart tender.  Gravy was fine.  But for $17.95, it didn't bring enough flavor or appeal to ever order again.I doubt I would venture back and I wonder how the Monroe St. crowd will receive them in the long haul.  The area restaurants that have been successful have been ones that serve real and honest food and are authentic about who they are.  This can't be said about Freiburg.
Chipotle Mexican Grill=Let's be real. I'm only writing this to get the First to Review because if you've been to one Chipotle, you've been to them all.  ;PAlthough this chain is known for their giant burritos, I like to pretend I'm eating healthy when I get their burrito bowls. Get the sofritas and tell your wee-tots it's ground pork because it's so flavorful, they wouldn't know they're eating tofu. Brown or white rice, black or pinto beans, with or without fajita veggies, sour cream, choice of salsa, and guacamole for an additional fee offered. Choose your poison.This location just opened so it's still super clean. On this Thursday afternoon, 10-12 of the friendliest people were working. I normally go to the location by Chandler Fashion Center but the people here are so much more friendly and down-to-earth. This will be my new fave Chipotle.Yup, it's Chipotle. The interior is nice and the staff are very friendly (Even for a cold dreary Monday haha). Despite getting a burrito with a variety of salsas and cheese, aside from the meat the burrito itself tasted a little bland. The pinto beans were especially lacking in seasoning. I had to pile on the hot sauce to actually get any flavor! The barbacoa was decent, and tasted strongly of cumin. On a good note the burritos themselves are a hefty size and they will gladly pile on various toppings if you ask (I was a pig and asked for pico, corn, and green tomatillo salsa).
BluNotes of Charlotte=The new kid on the block resides in Davis Lake and if you remember the restaurant Bite Your Tongue, the menu will look very familiar to you as those owners are now affiliated with this restaurant.  I decided to avoid the crowd and stopped by for lunch with my son and was very impressed with the quick service and reasonably priced options.  I ordered a kid's meal of fried shrimp, fries and a drink for $6.99 and an order of red beans and rice at $5.99.  Their signature drink is called 'Strango' a blend of strawberry lemonade and mango tea and it is very tasty!  The shrimp were huge for a kids meal and seasoned to perfection and the red beans and rice were excellent as well.  I must admit I was pleasantly surprised that we were in and out in about 45 minutes so lunch it is for me.  We decided to return for brunch after church to try the chicken and sweet potato waffles but we were told they didn't have them today so we left and hopefully they will have them next Sunday.  Also, they have live music almost daily including brunch so check them out if you're in the area.I visited here during my recent trip to Charlotte for Thanksgiving week. I was super hype to hear that it was a Louisiana style restaurant with live music, but after hearing it had recently opened I lowered my expectations somewhat and mentally prepared for some kinks.Well, glad I did that because the kinks were plentiful - but the party at my table was incredible so it took my mind off of it. The gumbo came out quickly, but it wasn't hot. I was too hungry to complain and overall, it was tasty. The rest of the food took over an hour to arrive, but when it did, it did not disappoint. I suppose items are made to order. Not really realistic, in my opinion - but I believe these are things that can be worked out as time goes on....but the owners need to make some immediate adjustments.
Flippin' Good Burgers & Shakes=Perhaps this is colored by my expectations but all the hype about fresh ingredients and flavor had me expecting something on par with a shake shack or smashburger style.   Instead I received a bland tasting burger overwhelmed by lettuce too big for the bun, tasteless bacon and a greasy bun.  The meat was overcooked.  The lettuce and toppings were otherwise fresh.  Also I would avoid the flipping good fries.  They are just drowned in thousand island and topped with "grilled" onions. I don't know what grill they used but mine tasted raw.  I couldn't even eat more than a few bites.  Price and fresh veggie ingredients save this place from a single star.Flippin' good? More like Flippin' mediocre. I love Fremont East. I've been kickin' it there before it was even dubbed Fremont East. I have excitedly walked by, watch the place evolve, and smelled glorious smells coming from within... A recent trip downtown lead me to Flippin' Good Burgers when I was starving.FGB is a cross between McDonald's and Smashburger, but waaaay closer to the McD's side. It's fast food. It's no IN-N-Out, it's not even Carl's Jr worthy. Yes, it's cleaner than a McD's and the staff is definitely friendlier, but it's just not special.I ordered a classic cheeseburger and a side of fries. The burger was bland, overcooked, served in a big ass bun (really, it's mostly buns, hun) and came with the lettuce, onion, and tomato (which were all fresh and still crisp). The fries were fries. Again, nothing to write home about.The food is really two star worthy, but the clean, freshness, newness, reasonable prices, and friendliness of the staff allow me to tip the stars in the favor of FGB.What could be considered my LIB HQ, I had quite a few meals at Flippin' Good last weekend. My order was always a double turkey burger (extra pickles, mustard), a side of fries and a water. Total: $7.xx. I know you can find some cheap eats on Freemont, but anytime you can REALLY stuff yourself for under $8, I'm a fan. As for the food itself, it wasn't half bad. Like others have mentioned, it's a step above a McD's, but probably a step down from a BurgerFi or Smashburger. Much respect for having a potato bun, 'merican cheese, fresh veggies (which you can ask them to pile on) and a legit sized patty. The Flippin Sauce on the burg' is no Animal Style from I&O or Mac Sauce, but it's not the worst. Bottom line, when intoxicated or in need of a relatively quick and inexpensive meal, this place isn't a bad place to be. Coat that stomach and rage on! Note: it takes 7-10 minutes to get your order. Prepare for that.I would call Flippin Good Burgers Flippin Humdrum.  I found it to be little more than a middle of the road fast food joint with a nice dining room and trendy location.  The fare definitely did not wow.  In my opinion, In n Out's flavors are superior.  We got the Bacon Cheeseburger, Grilled Chicken Sandwich, Onion Rings, & Flippin Fries, with Huckleberry and Pumpkin Pie milkshakes.  The Cheeseburger and Chicken were bland & overly greasy on stale buns, and the onion rings were overcooked.  The shakes were cloyingly sweet and artificial tasting.Overall, we just did not enjoy the items we purchased at Flippin Good, but the space itself is very nice and clean for a fast food restaurant.We're touring around here in Vegas and we just got back from walking around at Hoover Dam and need us some food for lunch. Got the car parked at one of the casinos nearby so we wanted something walking distance. Getting out the yelp, I see this place Flippin' Good Burgers opened recently and is right down here in the middle of the Fremont Street Experience area. OK, good choice!This is a casual burger place, maybe a bit above full on fast food as the quality seems higher. The prices are not bad, but you have to consider the beef patties used are not the biggest either. Probably like a 1/4 lb I think. You put your order in and the food comes out on one of those red trays. You get to build your burger just the way you want. After pondering all the options, I went with the Farm Burger 2X on the patty please. ($6.70) It comes with a fried egg, smoked bacon, Ketchup and cheese. I had them add free grilled onions to mine. My BF got the Bacon Cheeseburger 2X patties. ($6.60) That one came with lettuce, tomato, cheese and bacon. He added the grilled onions as well. Then we ordered an order of the fries to share ($2.05) as well as a 16oz Strawberry shake ($4.25) to share. That's a pretty cheap lunch considering you are in the middle of tourist central Vegas!The food come out in a timely manner. We were luck to get a place to sit. I beat him to the first taste of the fries ....yes, fresh cooked and not frozen, like those crinkle cut things. Nice fries, yum lets add salt and dip in mayo and Ketchup mix! OK, my first bite into my egg burger (farm burger), Yes, good flavor, getting the cheese mix with the bacon and the egg is good, cooked yolk still all little runny .....hard cooked doesn't cut it on a burger. It's not dinky around like an In N Out either ...bigger. More like a Habit Burger ....Vegas has one now! My BF enjoys his burger and we share the shake. The shake is thick and seem more "real" than one of those fake shakes at Mc D's. I'd say all and all a good stop for food if you don't feel like doing the whole sit down and be served thing. No, these burgers won't rival a premium burger at a brew pub, but for fast casual, it hits the mark.Flippin' Good is a flippin' cheap option for Fremont Street eats- two can easily dine under $20, and that's with a side and dessert to share! I was excited about this spot opening but hesitant to visit given the generally-underwhelmed reviews, but their claims of freshness eventually tempted me through the door. BURGERS: The menu lists single- and double-burgers for each style, I opted for the classic and realized why. The patty thickness is somewhere between White Castle and Dollar Menu Double. Props for offering a lettuce-wrapped version. Beef version, like all the other reviews, lends itself to a less-favorable comparison to that West coast chain. The turkey burger retained a surprising juiciness and the toppings were fresh.FRIES: The regular variety are lightly salted, but if your a fan of spice, opt for the Flippin' Spicy style. I openly admit that these were WAY too spicy for me, with tons of chopped grilled jalapenos in every nook and cranny. These were perfectly topped too: so much cheese and pepper that it was difficult to find bare fries, even at the bottom. A win for most people, a lose for me, because it rendered the dish inedible, but this is entirely my fault.CONCRETE:  A few specialty versions for a sweet dessert treat, BF opted for the Brownie Delight, whose chocolaty tones were reminiscent of a Frosty, in a good way. The 10oz small is just the right size and the bits of brownie blended in added a nice texture that didn't take away from the overall creaminess.Service was quick and cheery, space is clean and welcoming with framed, mirrored windows on the walls lending a farm-house feeling. This is a nice addition to the area given their relatively low price point and the fact that they deliver on their promised freshness. But it's not the kind of meal I'll cross town for, nor one I can justify paying a parking fee to access due to the location. Outside of the downtown area, I'd probably be more inclined to give them another try.
SoHo Gourmet Cuisines=I'm digging SoHo. As a resident of the Fitch, I am always excited to see a new restaurant open. Located in the former Cousins Subs, the food cart opened this fast casual restaurant. The menu is limited and is what I would consider Asian fusion. I opted for the chicken curry. Flavor wise, it was delicious. Not as sweet as a Thai curry. I would consider it a hybrid between Thai and Indian with a decent amount of spice. The only thing holding this back is the lack of protein. Ordered with chicken, it was big on flavor but light on yardbird. While the price point is relatively low ($8.50), I sill expected more. I will definitely return as it a perfect place for when you don't want to cook but you also don't want to waste an hour plus at a sit down restaurant.  Welcome to the neighborhood, SoHo!Working on the south side of Madison, I have access to a wealth of Asian food options, so I was curious to find out how SoHo Gourmet Cuisine was going to carve out a niche for itself in this crowded market. While the dumplings I sampled from the SoHo food cart this past summer failed to impress, my experience at their bricks and mortar facility was far more impressive.  When combined with passionate service and an inviting interior, the well prepared food at SoHo has my taste buds clamoring for a return visit.When I stepped into the restaurant, I barely recognized it from its previous incarnation as a Cousin's Sub Shop.  The open kitchen, with its gleaming stainless steel fixtures immediately caught my eye.  Two large flat screens located above the counter project the menu options to prospective patrons.  The matching black chairs and tables, together with the grey and cream floor tiles provided additional flair to the space.  A boom box on a table in the center of the restaurant provided some soothing background music during my meal.  While the dining area has a flat screen TV was mounted on the wall, it was not turned on during my visit.The focused lunch menu has three main categories: 1) Dumplings (chicken, beef and pork) 2) Rice plates (BBQ Pork, Curry and Charbroil Chicken) and 3) Salads (Lemon Balsamic, Sassy Peanut and Soy Citrus).  I elected to go with the daily special, the ginger - garlic fried rice with the $2 fried chicken skewer.  After about five minutes, I received a massive bowl of fried rice topped with a perfectly fried runny egg.  I savored the combination of the runny yolk with the fried rice - my only regret was that I wish there was more yolk.  The fried rice was well prepared - not only did the kitchen do a terrific job of balancing the ginger and garlic components, they served the homemade soy sauce on the side, so I could control the seasoning of my dish.The fried chicken stick was simply spectacular.  The crunchy, lightly battered exterior gave way to the succulent, well-seasoned interior.  It easily was the best $2 I spent that week.  Rocky, the passionate owner of SoHo, personally checked in with all the patrons during the busy lunch service.  He quickly established a rapport with all the customers, whether they were newbies like myself, or repeat customers to the restaurant.Based on this sensational experience, I can't wait to return.  The combination of speedy, enthusiastic service with flavor-packed Asian-influenced fare makes SoHo Gourmet Food a welcome addition to my South Madison lunch circuit.
The Vandal=Dear Lord this place is good. Like really good. Like I want this in my life every day good. It's a simple menu of only a handful of choices, but I have no doubt every single item is delicious.This is because my pork sandwich, with apple jam and a perfectly crisped kale chip on top was pure heaven. The side dish of green beans, ricotta, apple jam and egg was the perfect pairing. To top this off, I had the most delicious vanilla lemonade. One thing I will note is that this does not come cheap. The total was $22. Honestly, it was totally worth it. But if you're looking for a cheap lunch, this is not your place.The decor is GORGEOUS too. It looks like that home decor magazine you subscribe to and want for your own. Exposed brick, herringbone hardwood floors, marble tables and exposed beams. That's it. I gotta go once a week to feed my craving!There's "toast," and then there's TOAST.  Vandal's "Toasts" fall into the latter category. I arrived at The Vandal one sunny Sunday Lville morning with a crew of 6. We were seated right away and ordered from the counter after perusing the [small] menu. I chose the Huckleberry Toast while Aimee D. chose the Squash Toast so we could share.  Among the groups' other choices were the Morning Burger, a Bacon Plate and Celery Soup.  We all left pleased, but maybe just a tad bit hungry. The Toasts are INCREDIBLE, but at the end of the day, it's one [big] piece of toast. So, if you're looking for more, I'd recommend adding the yogurt/granola for some delicious protein. We were each given a sample of this concoction and DAMN, was it good.  But back to the toasts - the ingredients on top were clearly top notch. At $6, each Toast isn't going to break the bank, but $12 for two, which I definitely could've housed, is a bit too much for me for...toast. Something to think about. I recommend going with a bunch of friends and completely "vandalizing" the menu - meaning, order one of everything and have at it. Welcome to Lawrenceville, Vandal!Parking in Lawrenceville is nearly impossible except on Sundays when it is free! I  pulled in to a small lot near this place and when I went to register the car I noted the free parking.So I walked in, the place is small but packed with people but I managed to find a table. The menu is on a chalkboard above the counter, you place your order and  they bring it out to you. Since today was Sunday brunch I saw that the special was a plate of bacon or ham with fried eggs, kale salad, and toast for $11.00. I saw one of them and thought too much fat on the bacon or it was burnt on another order so I decided to opt for something else.I asked the counter manager his recommendation since this was my first time here. He said that I would enjoy the "squash toast". It is toast topped with caramelized onions and kale. I also ordered the yogurt and granola parfait to go with it. For a drink he recommended the lavender lemonade. So I went with that. Most everything else here is ala carte but I got away with $16.00 for my selections.I paid for my breakfast and sat down. At each table they have tap water in a closed bottle. I received my meal fairly quick and the same man who took my order helped me out. I noticed that although I loved the toast it was a bit hard to cut with a knife. He took it back and had it cut for me. I asked him what type of bread they use for their toast. I was told they use sourdough bread from 5 points  which is some bakery over on Wilkins Ave in Squirrel Hill.The food was very good and I got to chat with a couple at the next table. He was having a fried doughnut with a creme filling before the main course. He said that he often comes here for lunch and recommends I try the fried chicken sandwich. Sounds like a plan to me!I noticed that they have take out and by the time I was finished this place was packed with people waiting for tables. My advice would be to get here early since this must be a popular place. When I left I took note of other businesses I thought interesting so it will definitely mean a return trip.Eat like a vandal! The food is ravenously good!As other have written, this is a nice space.  The staff stopped by a couple of times to see how we were doing and if everything was good.  It was!My burger with tomato mayo and pickles was tasty.  Loved the pickles and burger.  Some of the tomato mayo dripped on my fries, Oh so good.  Just like in Europe with some mayo on you fries!  Should have asked for a little to dip my fries into.  The mayo probably could have a tad more tomato for flavor. The lavender tea was tasty.Surprised they did not have WiFi.
Oregano's Pizza Bistro=Well most of these reviews are about the staff, my review is about the food. This is a new restaurant in Queen Creek people, you are going to wait AT LEAST an hour for a table and staff is going to be on the fritz for a little until they get their groove down. This happens every time a new place opens up out here, so we decided to get it to go, smarter choice so we thought. I ordered lunch about 12:15 figuring it would be a while for them to make it, so our pick up time was 1:15 (an hour for a to go order, ouch). When we picked up our food at 1:10, nothing was hot, you could tell it was made a while ago and was just sitting out waiting for us to pick up, if you are going to tell us a prompt pick up time, don't let the food sit out forever. We already waited in line to get our to go order, I wasn't going to send the food back. Got it home, yep, ice cold!I got the pesto pasta, my boyfriend got the regular spaghetti with sausage, my sister got a pizza and my son got a slice of pizza. After we all re-heated our food, we finally got to eat. Unfortunately I only took about 3 bites of my food and I threw it away. The cheese was hard (even after I warmed it up) because it had been sitting out at the restaurant too long so it made the pasta really dry, there was hardly any sauce which made it taste really bland and I couldn't eat any of the bread bowl it came in because it was rock hard and stale. My boyfriends spaghetti was ok, nothing special about it, the sausage was nice and spicy so that was good. My sisters pizza was also tasteless (you're a pizza place, how does a pepperoni pizza not taste good!?) Then last my sons cheeses pizza, cold and hard as a rock. Luckily he's 5 so pizza is pizza, he was the only one who ate all their food. Oregano's I know you just opened and things are rough at the beginning, having poor staff is one thing, but serving awful food....... come on!? A waste of $50 on family dinner, ended up having to cook something because everyone was still hungry.
Paris Baguette=We fell in love with this place. It's located inside Venetian hotel canal shoppes. You really feel like you are in Europe. The restaurants have that exact lighting that they use in Europe.The pastries look shiny, colorful & glazed & most importantly they are DELICIOUS. We ordered the berry tart, berry waffle, almond pastry. Also the latte & cappuccino were perfect.  The berry waffle was swirled with chocolate & had a very yummy homemade wipe cream on it. It tasted really perfect.Then we ordered the mozzarella sandwich, it was Devine!!! I think I died went to heaven & came back with every bite. I highly recommend this Restuarant. I wish they would open one near us in Palis Verdes. We don't have a great French bakery/Restuarant near us.
The Red Pot=We heard this is a new hot pot restaurant and we decided to try it out today. We arrived there 5:30pm and it was a little busy. The food is fresh, and there are lots of selections of vegetables and seafood. However, they have a HORRIBLE service. After a while, my water glass was empty, and I asked for refills. The server refilled my drink, but after that, he just disappeared! After an hour and half, my water is empty again. I desperately needed my water to be refilled. The soup base was empty too. Nobody showed up for the whole hour!!!We didn't even have a chance to ask for water and soup!!!! After eating, we waited another half an hour to see if the server would show up and give us the bill. Well, nobody showed up. We went to the cashier, and the cashier wanted us to go back so that he know which table we were at. I complained to the manager. Guess what the manager said? "I'm sorry. We just opened the business, and our employees have no ideas about their serving sections." Seriously? Are you being sincere at all? This is how you deal with a customer who complains to you? Well, if you are in restaurant business, you should have known how to provide quality service to your customers and train your servers properly so that they know which sections they are responsible for! Guess what? When we were paying the bill, the sever who served us was standing next to us and getting bills for other tables. He saw us and he totally ignored us!!! One ironic thing is the restaurant is located by UNLV and they surely hire Hotel College students. So the manager just hire those kids who learned nothing about service and hospitality? Well, I have given the opportunity to manager, but he refused to make more money from me and my friends. I'm going to let my friends know how bad the service is here. We're NEVER gonna come back.Summary:The reason for the one star rating is because of the great service (sarcasm to a certain extent). The place was empty on a Wednesday night so all the servers were very attentive to our table of 4. Now the following reasons are why it is missing the other 4 stars. The following sections well depicts my horrid experience and spoiler alert, food poisoning.Price:35 per person equates to roughly about 45 per person after tax and tips. I have been in town for long enough to know that the usual price for a similar all you can eat dinner is 25-30 at most unless the store is established in a hotel on the strip. But the Caesars Palace Bacchanal Buffet is only 50-60 before tax per person depending on the day of the weak. They are established in a school area which also equates to students that will not be able to shell out 35 for a dinner. Yes, their target demographic might be rich second generation kids (guessing from the decor, which in detail is also shit) but then why is the place so big? ADDITIONALLY, they charge for soda, 3 dollars a cup but with unlimited refills. Therefore, I believe the solution to the problem is to eliminate soda charges and not offer the crab since it was not fresh anyways and lower the RIDICULOUS price. The total for our party of 4 people total was 195 after tax and tip, ridiculous. Taste:4/4 in our party had diarrhea following the dinner. We ordered a half and half pot. Both broth were refilled with non spicy broth which made the spicy side un-spicy. Meat were average, great selection of vegetable, seafood was not fresh and bad. Pot Tea, Yojie, and many other places are much more delicious taste wise. Atmosphere:Walking in was very awkward since no one greets you and you face the bar area. Right side is the restroom which when I was there, it had a broken handicap stall door. Lighting is good, music fits in pretty well. Then walking forward, you can see the wall of meat and seafood to one side and vegetable on the other. The worst part about the whole buffet area is the sauce area, way too crowded and the spoon are way to small to fill the sauce bowls. So a lot of people are there trying to decide on sauce then uses additional time for using the small spoons. The soda machine is next to the seafood area, again 3 dollars after the ridiculous 35 dollars. Great. (sarcasm)Service:We heard about this store over WeChat advertisement and word of mouth before it even opened, it was greatly hyped and they had full seating and that made service horrible since the place is so big (oversized in my opinion). Then when people tried once and hated it, business died down to now or when we went there (close to now). Therefore there is a lack of business for the size of the place (as I stated before). This also equates to overstaff which is good and bad, it is awkward at times (people watching you eat) but then the good is that there is instant service. The 35 just makes me not want to tip, seriously.Final Words:I do not want to seem cheap to anyone, I drive a Porsche Cayenne Turbo. But seriously, the pricing is very unjust. The food does not justify the price. The atmosphere nor the service either. Our party of four all left with food poisoning. What motivated me to write this is, we paid a premium for food poisoning and a so-so experience? Right. Decor: 3/5Service: 3.5/5Price: 1/5Taste: 2/5Quality of Food: 1/5 (Food Poisoning)Portion: 5/5I came to visit from California and my friends suggested trying this place because it had just opened up next to their school. Went in on a rather slow night, and I figured it was because it was a week day since the place was almost completely empty. After we got seated, we saw that it was all you can eat, $35. We were a bit hesitant at first because ayce places usually ranges from around $20~25, but we didn't think it would be too bad because hey, usually quality makes paying a little extra worth it. Boy was I wrong! They have a large variety to choose from- seafood, meats, vegetables. Almost everything you could ask for for hot pot, so that was a huge plus. We grabbed everything we wanted, but getting sauces took a lot longer than necessary. They only have one bar, and the spoon you use to scoop the sauces are about the size of a teaspoon. So everyone is just lined up, one by one with your average rude purple who would come shoving in here and there to try to get at least 10 scoops of a sauce along with other scoops for added flavor. Once we got everything we wanted, we went to our table with our pot (flavors: regular mushroom broth/mild spicy broth). The broth was rather bland and almost tasteless. Even the spicy broth wasn't all that spicy and just got less spicy the more we ate and as the servers would gradually refill our pots. Which is a disappointment especially since the broth is what usually leaves an impression for hot pot. The seafood  wasn't really fresh, but the lamb and beef made up for it. We left the place feeling very disappointed and unsatisfied. Our bill came out to almost $200 (gratuity + tax included) for 4 people. The only good thing I could say about this place is that the decor was beautiful, and the service was very attentive, yet again- there were only like 3 tables to tend to. I don't think I'll be coming back at all. We always have an appetite for hot pot, but this place was ridiculously expensive and was definitely not worth the price at all. I go to regular hot pot places that are not ayce and the price doesn't even sum up to here. Even $10 ayce hot pot places are a lot better and more flavorful.**update: we all got food poisoning. Definitely never coming back.3 dollars for fountain soda? 35 dollars per person for frozen meat and average seafood?One of the waiters (Probably new) just kind of stood and watched us eat and had to be told when to refill our drinks and take our dirty plates.I'm torn about this place. On one hand the food was good, price was fair ($28 with 20% promotion), and service was super attentive. Pick a broth, take the food buffet style, and cook it in the pot at your table. This place doesn't have ponzu sauce but I made it myself using soy sauce, ice water, and lemons. There's seafood, meats, vegetables, and fresh fruits for desserts. On the other hand, I was rushed to the ER and hospitalized overnight for a severe reaction to their bad blue crab (photo attached). Upon telling them this they were indifferent.I wouldn't eat here again because I like breathing.
Fogo de Chão Brazilian Steakhouse=i was lucky enough to be invited to the soft opening at FOGO!throughout my whole experience, we received the greatest service from the FOGO staff. morgan recommended the best meats and knew her pairings with the sauces. my favorite was the chimichurri and the hot sauce. the meats were non stop and everything was delicious. i loved their PICANHA steak and couldn't stop eating it. it was seasoned so well and i love how it was thinly sliced with a bit of fat on the side. i couldn't stop asking for more. my card was always on the GREEN GO side. the market table provided a variety of veggies, cheeses, deli meats, salmon, rice, and many more! i like how you can keep going back for more. the server was saying that fogo is an all you can experience. my favorite was the fresh mozzarella cheese, quinoa kale salad, prosciutto, and baby corn. the brazilian cheese bread was the BEST part of them all. i couldn't stop eating them! very addicting. fogo also provides caramelized bananas to help cleanse your tasting palette. i thought it was very accommodating and a good idea. the service is top notch at fogo. my party and i felt so welcomed by the friendly staff. our drinks were constantly refilled and our plates were always changed. the staff also had this tool to clean the crumbs off the table and thought it was great! the restaurant is super clean and very modernized. i would definitely recommend this restaurant for a date night or a special occasion. i can't wait to come back for more!I feel like Jim Carrey's character from the movie "Yes Man" whenever I am at a churrascaria...totally incapable of saying no to anything!   Caipirinhas? Yes, and please keep them coming.  Bottom sirloin?  Heck yes!  I'll take 3 slices.  Lamb chops?  OH FUCK YES!!  Leave the whole freakin thing on the table!!!  No....control.....whatsoever.  If a shady looking dude wearing a hat and a musty  overcoat offered candy corn straight from the palm of his slightly dirty hand, I would say yes and assume it was a limited time promotion.  Fogo de Chao vs Texas de Brazil:  It's a high scoring draw. Sure, there a few items the other one doesn't have, and certain meats may be slightly better at one over the other, but everyone ends up a winner in this fight no matter which you choose.
Soho Pizza Bar=I don't know that I've ever left a bad review. I think it's bad karma. That said, this experience warrants a warning to others. The food was terrible. Not just your run of the mill, not what I expected so I'm dissatisfied bad, but legit bad. On a Saturday afternoon, they were out of chicken wings. The garlic knots they provided as an apology were spackled with that crappy jarred minced garlic that stays in your throat for weeks and tasted like Pirates of the Caribbean smells. And the pizza. It was the same pizza they sell at the Mini Gran Prix because kids don't know the difference, but this pizza was 4x the price. The crust had that mildewy taste, the sauce was about on par with undoctored canned tomato sauce and it was DRIPPING with grease, which is usually a sign of good pizza. Not so here. Coming from an Italian family, I am programmed not to leave food uneaten, but I made an exception this time. The New York headquarters of this brand should shut this location down immediately or risk sullying the name on the West Coast.TLDR: Strip prices without a Strip location. Pizza itself has fairly good flavor, just don't order with mushrooms or take it to go. If you're paying for the view, you might as well enjoy it.Came in after a run around the lake, happy to see they have a two-slice lunch special- unfortunately, they want $6/slice, which is on par with Secret Pizza's pricing. Adding on a single topping will run you a buck a slice. $14 for two pepperoni slices and a drink?! For a couple bucks more, you can get an entire 12" specialty pie (tax + tip will make it ~$20). What Shark Tank reject did the valuation and menu pricing?!Opted for the featured Don Michele Meat Pizza (pepperoni, Italian sausage, smoked bacon, and onions), subbed mushrooms for the onions. Flavor was below average: they use canned mushrooms (which isn't in line with their premium prices), they forgot the bacon listed in the ingredients, and the pizza was under cooked in the middle. Crust itself was okay- chewy not crispy, decent sauce.
Pieology Pizzeria=I started off a loyal customer, but I've had too many bad experiences here to continue supporting this location.They certainly started off strong and staff was very attentive when they first opened, but I've noticed a very steep decline in service, especially with the attitudes of the staff and quality of food. Half the pizzas I was ordering started to come out burnt and the overall flavor just wasn't as good. Last visit, when I went up to order a pizza with their traditional crust, I asked for alfredo sauce as the base sauce. The worker instead proceed to make me their Alfredo's Alfredo pizza. I stopped before she could put on more toppings and she gave me a ton of attitude and explained that this was all the things that came with my order. I let her know I only replied "alfredo please" when she asked me my sauce choice. She begrudgingly started a new pizza for me and gave me lackluster service the whole time. I constantly had to ask if she could include more of the toppings I asked for, when she couldn't even look me directly in the eye. I get people have bad days in the food service industry, I had plenty myself when I worked at Mrs. Fields, Panda Express and Hot Dog on a Stick. No matter how mad you are or how bad your day is, there is a minimum standard of service someone should bring to the table even during those times. My husband wanted to continue to patron this place, until he got screwed over on his order, so he then agreed, no more Pieology for us. Same worker above made his BBQ chicken pizza - we take it home, and no BBQ sauce put on after it was cooking. He was mad lol, but serves him right for making us go here one more time despite my protests. Side Note: there's a Bill Cosby quote on the wall, they should probably consider taking that down.Pro Tip: Go to The Pizza Kitchen on Fort Apache instead. Plentiful toppings and better quality ingredients.Ate salad for dinner!  Mostly croutons and tomatoes.  Really just one big round crouton covered with tomato sauce.  And cheese.  Fine, it was pizza.  I ate pizza.Since we made plans to hit the gym after dinner, I figured I'd help motivate myself and give myself a goal of burning off like 1,000 calories.  Genius, right [obviously joking but no seriously, I ate that pizza and then punished myself at the gym]?  I got myself half Alfredo's Alfredo and half Mad to Meat You.  I got artichoke hearts and black olives added for some more veggies.  I also got to pick at someone else's half Smokin' Buffalo Chicken and half Rustic Veggie pizza.  Both pizzas had a super generous amount of toppings.  Like I was seriously impressed.  One of the younger ladies tonight carefully placed all my toppings with care as well.  I was surprised since the other two make-your-own pizza places normally just toss everything on haphazardly so I appreciate the attention she gave it.  It ensured for a balanced bite every time.  After everything was topped onto my pie, they asked to make sure I was happy and it was great.  Wonderful service, seriously.  As for the crust, the crust is baked to be super crispy.  There was no way that crust was going to bend.  All in all, I was extremely pleased with Pieology!This Pieology Pizzeria location just recently opened so everything is nice and clean.  Throughout the whole time we sat there, we had multiple people check in on us to make sure everything was satisfying.  Seriously great service!Hey I really dig these make-it-to-order pizza joints.  I stopped in today and ordered the classic margherita plus artichokes.  The employees greet people right away, and I like the clean, sunny room.  Initially they seemed to be a little disorganized on keeping track of whose pizza was where in the oven, but that should work itself out in time.  They tried to give me Ed's pizza, and Ed's pizza looked pretty good, full of meat, mushrooms, and olives, but I'm not Ed.  I took my pie home to scarf in private and really enjoyed the flavors.  The garlicky olive oil is very nice and fresh tomatoes and basil make for a perfect mix of flavors.  I just think the grape tomatoes might not be the best idea.  They fall off easily.  Some sliced romas might work out better.The crust was crisp and buttery, just like I like it.  Overall this is a great addition to all the restaurants by the mall.  And the price...can't beat the price...$7.95 plus tax equals a pizza for $8.57, and I only ate half of it, I swear!
Sushi Takashi=Sushi Takashi is located in the former short lived Hiromaru ramen joint. But, they have changed the interior completely, with dark sexy colors and wood, cool booths, and a wide sushi bar. After taking a seat at the bar, I met the man himself, Chef Takashi, who is a friendly and cool person. While they do have an a la carte menu, I was more interested in the shiny, laminated menu that had some more unique options. On one side contained a 10 course and 12 course menu. And on the other side, a combo menu with a whole lot of options including a bottomless one, a roll one, a never ending salmon bowl, and a quick to-go bento. They also have an $80 ayce option. I decided to go with the 12 course.This was interesting because it wasn't like a traditional kaiseki, where the portions are super small. The value at Takashi's is better than most of the izakayas in the valley. And what else is interesting is that you modify the options on the course menu as you see fit.Before the courses began, they brought out some mini Japanese crackers to snack on. They were good.The first course was the the garlic edamame. The spices were really good and bright. And the edamame had a vibrant color.The next course was the tuna carpaccio. The fish quality was excellent and it went well with soy dressing that had yuzu in it.Next came the salad. I think that I made a great combo with the soba noodle and salmon skin options. The noodles were perfectly cooked and the salmon skin had a great texture to them. I enjoyed the tanginess of the mayo dressing that they used to bring everything together.The meat dish came out next. I ordered the beef teriyaki. This was a simplified version of grilled beef that was seasoned lightly. The beef was of very good quality, and was cooked to a spot-on medium rare. The sauce was kept on the light side, and helped amplify the taste of the beef, rather than mask it as some other spots tend to do.The chef also gave me a taste of the king crab that was available. You don't normally see this item in most sushi restaurants, and I appreciated that fact.The next course was the roll course, in which you can choose from the menu any one of specialty rolls on the menu. I chose the King club roll, which is their king crab made into a roll with avocado. What I noticed immediately was that their rice is cooked perfectly, not too hard or soft, and I personally don't like a too strong of a vinegar taste, and I liked that Takashi's was more neutral-sweet, because that gives it more of a natural taste to the rice. Seriously, king crab and avocado? Now that's what i'm talking about!Next course was the chicken, and I chose the karage. I liked the fact that the chicken were PIPING HOT!! A lot of sushi restaurants in Vegas can learn a thing or two from Takashi about making their karage more hot.Next the seafood course came, and I picked the oysters. Six large oysters were brought out in this Asian mignonette style sauce. They were fresh and sweet. I literally could have eaten about 50 of these. They were amazing. Next, the sukiyaki came out. It came with a generous amount of beef, and it was fun eating it with the noodles, onions, and scallions. The baked dish was next so what looked like a dynamite baked roll came out and was very tasty as well.My nigiri dish came out afterwards and I can say that I am impressed with the high quality of the fish they are using here. It's higher than Goyemon's and more like Yummy Grill's on Lake Mead (Not Eastern ave!!). The rice was perfect and everything just went really well together.The soup course then came. I ordered the creamy white stew. Looking back, I would have probably chosen the miso. I liked the earthiness of the stew, but it wasn't really my cup of tea.Chef Takashi wanted me to try their tuna belly before my last course as a gesture of their grand opening. Once again, they are using high quality fish, and they are thick slices. Mikey likes it!My last course came out which was the dessert course. I ordered the tempura ice cream. The ice cream was exquisite, and the batter was very neutral tasting, which highlighted the ice cream.Throughout the evening, what I realized was that I never felt rushed throughout the evening. The service was awesome, even though it's a brand new restaurant. It has actually been a really long time since I've felt just really comfortable eating at a sushi restaurant. My impression was that I was eating at a Strip high-end sushi restaurant, without having to pay those overpriced, exorbitant prices that those restaurants on the Strip usually command. Even though they have just opened, if they are able to maintain the quality, this would be one of my favorite sushi restaurants in Las Vegas. Great value, great quality, great service, great ambiance, that's all you can really ask for. I'm kinda over the AYCE thing, so i'm looking for a bit more, and Sushi Takashi delivers!The truckload of food that Takashi pushes out for his $40 twelve course dinners make Restaurant Week look like Restaurant Weak.  Seriously... you would need to attach a garbage disposal to your stomach to make it through this bad boy.  Maybe if my car broke down up on Mount Charleston and I walked all the way here would it be possible?  So while value, ambition, friendly service, and remarkable design upgrades cannot be denied, my fault is with the execution and general flow of the menu.  Even for myself, I find it hard to believe I am complaining about too much food, but I am going there.   As an example, course plate #4-#8 could easily go chicken teriyaki, huge sushi roll, 6 oysters, karaage (fried chicken) and then beef sukiyaki.  That's like a mixtape going from Mozart to Slipknot to Whitney Houston to last year's Grammy winning polka artist.  Why are oysters right in the dead center of the 12?  Who goes from fried meat to sukiyaki in real life?  Something like this should be harmonious from beginning to end, but I just looked at it as battles within battles.  The menu vs my stomach capacity, the food vs the ever-growing takeout bag the servers kept loading up, my waistline vs my pants, my tastebuds' sanity vs "holy shit, we're only on #5??"  A server informed us that only one person had been able to plow through it all since they opened and that "He was a Yelper".  Nice job, Yelper.  Did you go to Home Depot or Lowe's for that attachment? ;)If you're still going to do this, these are the battles between course choices:#3: Soba Salad vs Tofu Salad vs Potato Salad: My wife's Soba Salad won.  The dressing mixed with the cold noodles and crisp greens were excellent.  You also get a choice of salad topping (grilled salmon, chicken or salmon skin).  We both went with grilled salmon although perhaps the salmon skin might have come off like a luxurious crouton and been the way to go.  Don't load up on potato!  Trust me.  #6: Oysters vs Snow Crab: It was a TKO by the oysters.   Even though the crab was nicely presented on a chilled plate, it could never be a match of 6 large raw oysters on a wooden boat.  This would retail for at least $18 elsewhere.  I will be back for this the next time dining a la carte.   #7: Tempura vs Karaage: We barely touched either of these due to fullness and what was still to come, but I'd go with the tempura which was a nice medley of veggies along with 2 pieces of shrimp.  Even though the karaage was dry and uninspiring, it lasted better in the fridge whereas tempura should be eaten immediately and was really bad a couple of days later.  Already stuffed to the gills, it was at this point that we considered asking to return tomorrow to finish the rest.  Would it be OK if I just left my credit card overnight?  I saw that there was a foot spa in the same plaza.  Maybe we could come back in an hour?  That moment sounded as good a time as any to take up cigarette smoking.  #8: Beef Sukiyaki vs Diced Steak:  Bitch, please.  Not only did the steak not put up a fight, they didn't even walk into the ring.  Flawless victory!  The sukiyaki was classic.  It was rich and filled with noodles, vegetables and semi-fatty beef which made the broth even better.  We asked for a side of raw egg to dip the beef into, and that made those 6 combined bites we took before they whisked it away in takeout boxes even better.  This could have been a standalone entrée.  #9: Mini Doria vs 4 pc Baked Fantasy:  They should get rid of this course altogether.  The doria is a bowl of rice topped with a mix of ground beef, tomato sauce and cream.  No one in their right mind would want this after everything else.  Ditto for a gross hot sushi roll filled with cream cheese.  Lose, lose.  Server: "Anything else?"Me: "Lap band surgery."#10: 4 piece nigiri vs Salmon Bowl (more rice!) vs Hamburger:  Nigiri won.  It was the smallest portion of food!  Tony T was at another table and got the hamburger which was a FULL HAMBURGER, BUN AND ALL WITH FRIES.  Am I going crazy?  Some may avoid this spot because their AYCE is $80 per person, but with the exorbitant amount of food we walked out with, it'll be more about all you can't eat.  There were 5 more individual meals with the leftovers we had!  Portions should be halved, if not quartered, and everything needs to be rearranged by someone with sane eyes.   No one would complain about paying $40 for that.I didn't partake of the 10- or 12-course meal of insanity, but there's really no way around it: no matter what you get here, you WILL eat a monstrous amount of food. I appreciate that they offer several specials as well as typical a la carte options, and the menu itself is extensive, with several apps, a giant page of rolls, and everything in between.CHICKEN KARAGE: So crispy, so juicy! I love Japanese fried chicken, and the version put out here is done just right.SALMON SKIN SALAD: Holy giant portions, Batman! This salad alone could easily be a lunch, packed with fish (not just skin), fruit, and an ample amount of fresh veggies in a light, flavorful dressing. Nice variety of textures, too.3 ROLL COMBO: This option allows you to pick three special rolls, and get bottomless miso soup, house salad, and dessert (various ice creams) for a crazy-low $26, which is easily enough food for two people but at a cost that rivals the AYCE pricing elsewhere. The miso was standard but the house salad was the first I've come across in an Asian restaurant that included avocado! Add some of the chicken from your karage app and this could easily be a "safe" meal for a kid or picky eater. Opted for the Nagasaki (great cilantro sauce!), the Orange Lemon (citrus + seafood = love), and the Sapporo (just enough spice) and found them all unique and tasty, with fresh fish, minimal rice, and tasty (but not overpowering) sauces. The food was so tasty that we kept ordering and my stomach staged a revolt after the onslaught of food. But in a good way. Pricing is very fair: even a sashimi appetizer plate for two (~10 pieces) is an extremely reasonable $15. I'll definitely be coming back- in addition to the amazing food, the service is on point (ask for Jeffrey!), and the interior is a fun mix of classy and rustic. NOTE: You can buy a $12 shirt and get 10% off on future visits when you wear it! I haven't done that yet, but if we come back often enough, I might just have to.Yummy in my tummy when in Vegaaaaa!Their seating booth area is shaped as half wine barrels - pretty neat!  Service was attentive and nice!Food for happy hours was happening!  I love their salmon sashimi carpaccio.  The vinegar sauce with the smooth textured salmon, was delicious.  Do order up.  Also, the sprinkled salt asparagus, was swell and crisp to my liking.  Eat it if you need some veggie in your dietary system. They have a lot of variety on their menu to choose from.  I like the raw oysters.  It was refreshing for the hot weather Vegas - if you go during the summer heat.Bathrooms were a change of theme.  Instead of a standard or Japanese styled themed restroom, it was French themed with classical music played in the background.  Interesting. I got my sashimi sushi game on here and enjoyed the restaurant entirely.With all the AYCE sushi places in town, how could Takashi compete? Well, for one, you get seated right away and they have great selections to choose from...for a price. I know people out there who love to give bad reviews because a place is "expensive" - stay away!Depending on what you're interested in (cooked entrees, sushi, everything), there's a set for you. For the average AYCE sushi goers, I'd recommend the Takashi's Bottomless Dinner for $23 which includes salad, carpaccio or sashimi, miso soup, cooked entree and a roll. They also have 10-course dinner set and a 12-course dinner set.But what I always come here for is the Salmon Overflow Bowl. For $30 you get salad, miso soup and lots of salmon sashimi (there's rice underneath all the salmon). If you're a big fan of salmon like I am, this is worth it. I normally get seconds because it is a lot of salmon. They have different rolls and nigiri and other items you can order ala carte. The fish is always fresh and the cuts are good.
Salute Trattoria Italiana=For now this is a temporary review of a guest tasting:Slated to open on 9/16/15 under the same Clique banner that brought Hearthstone Kitchen and Cellar to the Red Rock Hotel and Casino, Salute Trattoria Italiana by Luciano Sautto promises to do the same for regional Italian cuisine as its sibling did for upscale Americana, an early al fresco preview showing the same passion for ingredient sourcing while creativity and craftsmanship far outstrip anything the Western Suburbs has yet to know.Occupying the space across from Mercadito, managing partner Brian Massie and Maitre D' Enrico Sautto plus Hearthstone GM Peter Varela present throughout our meal, the space harboring Salute is long and shotgun straight with a Television-clad bar juxtaposing the outdoor patio, a beautifully tiled kitchen to the right while Antipasti and desserts are featured prominently behind glass closer to the Casino's core.Smartly sourcing the skills of an accomplished Italian Chef, while additionally spending a significant amount of time researching authentic recipes throughout Rome and the Amalfi Coast on a trip earlier this calendar year, the menu at Salute features six sections spread across two pages, the extensive selection of antipasti alongside crudo and salads while sides join pastas and entrees in numbers trumping ten.Indulgent in bread service, the costini served with antipasti toasted golden crisp while warm rosemary Focaccia upped the ante with good olive oil and old balsamic, course two featured one of three crudo and taking the road less traveled in presenting chopped Yellowtail glistening in an "Italian-Style" ponzu each bite was every bit as balanced as those seen at Hearthstone, the essence of fennel riding high on the palate while pinenuts added both texture and a mellow finishing note.Offered as an appetizer as opposed to the traditional wedge of oily parm, Sautto's take on roasted eggplant beneath fresh fior di latte was another opening stunner, and although a touch less crispy that some might have liked the sauce of little more than pure San Marzanos straight from his family restaurant overseas was the very essence of freshness, certainly not the sugared up iteration so frequently offered in America and meant to pass as "Italian" fare.Enjoying the spirit of good food, good friends, and good wine as the kitchen switched gears to the menu's right half, it was here that Enrico presented a pizza perfected through years of practice and although not currently planned for the restaurant suffice it to say that the results were absolutely fantastic, the same to be said of a fanciful table-side presentation of Salute's signature Fettuccini alla Vodka just a few minutes later, the booze lit afire within a wheel of cheese with sauced al dente pasta soon added, the results setting a new standard for taste as well as showmanship, a dish bound to gather eyes from onlookers and then to sell itself.Rounding out the savories with a salt crusted fish whose bargain basement price seems almost impossible considering the quality of the moist and meaty flesh, it was alongside lightly roasted spaghetti squash simply dressed in crushed tomatoes and Pecorino that a sampling of the sides was offered, the quality of ingredients left to show for themselves.Always excited for desserts, particularly given Chef Sautto and Massie's obvious desire to introduce and expand on the flavors seen during their respective times in Rome, the Tiramisu at Salute presents light and cloud-like without all the cloying sweetness or booze that fall so many others while Coconut Cake and a Flourless Chocolate Torte each speak to the work of a skilled baker, the gelatos and sorbets both here and served on freshly made cones on par with any restaurant in the Valley - the Stracciatella and Coconut particularly quite refined.I have eaten at Salute twice--once before the restaurant was open in a private dinner for 6 people and on opening night when seven of us gathered to try a number of dishes.  Items ordered:Pizza acquaAranciniAumm Aumm pastaTruffle tagliatelleLinguini with zucchini flowersLinguini vongoleSpaghetti carbonaraGnocchiPappardelle BologneseBaked rigatoniCrespelli CannelloniLasagnaSciué SciuéSpaghetti and meatballsSignature pastaChicken parmesanLemon chickenSide of broccoliniZucchini flowersBomboloniToasted coconut cakeFlourless chocolate torteThere are some winners in the pasta heavy dishes we tried.  The Signature pasta, done table side with flaming vodka in a wheel of parmigiano reggiano to melt some of the cheese and then having the vodka sauced pasta finished in the melted cheese wheel with some fresh basil leaves pulled off a plant and mixed in the pasta.  The flavors are very good and it's one of those fun dishes to watch being created at your table.The lasagna is a must try dish.  It's layered spinach pasta filled with tomato béchamel sauce and bolognese gravy.  The béchamel-cheese in the layers is creamy goodness.The gnocchi, pappardelle Bolognese, and spaghetti carbonara are good choices.Dishes to avoid:  Zucchini flowers, baked rigatoni, spaghetti and meatballs, and the arancini.This was opening night but the room was a veritable zoo that night.  The service was all over the place.  Our server was very good but his bussers just weren't up to the job.  There were times that there were main dishes to serve and there were no share plates for the table.  Our server tried to rectify this only to have some of the workers ignore the problem at hand.  You can;'t chalk this up to opening night jitters.  There had been a couple of soft opening nights prior to this one when many of these issues should have been addressed and solved.I'll be back, but they need time to sort out what's right and wrong with the service and to make some corrections to the food, specifically the meatballs and some other items.  Salute has a lot of promise but they'll need to make some changes to deliver a good product with good service.Owned by the suddenly swelling "Clique" group, whose Hearthstone has become an across-the-street go-to for a great meal from a kitchen staff I trust, it was after several back-and-forths with PR that myself and a few friends sat down on the patio of Salute just prior to its opening - the service expectedly exemplary straight from the hands of Chefs Sautto and Massie while food proved both bold and well-crafted enough to book an opening-night visit with friends as well as family...or at least so it seemed.No doubt a beautiful space, the interior long and shotgun straight with the left wall running bar to tiled kitchen to antipasti station as art and tiles decorate the walls, it was after a warm welcome at the podium that our party of seven was led to a large central table, greetings offered by everyone from GM Peter to Maitre 'd Enrico and Chef Luciano, the service from a friend an additional treat though Chef Massie apparently could not leave the pass or even be bothered to turn around.Acknowledging opening night jitters, the majority a fault of completely lost back-servers and a bar that couldn't seem to keep up with a quarter-capacity crowd, it was after a short discussion with Chef Luciano that the kitchen was given carte blanche with a focus on pastas, 32 of the restaurants offerings sampled over the course of this meal plus a next-day "Invite Only" with results running the gamut from exquisite to decidedly mediocre with price-to-portion ratios a bit skewed to the left.Already altering both the offerings and the costs from what was featured during the pre-opening taste, suffice it to say that some interesting items such as Osso Bucco Ravioli were axed in favor of far too many dishes centered on simple tomato sauces, the tableside Fettuccini delicious with a bit less sauce than what was featured prior while the rich Spinach Lasagna was delightfully decadent beneath Bolognese and creamy Bechamel.  Less successful with undercooked Carbonara and Truffle Tagliatelle that really has no business being served during the earliest days of Fall, a better bite is found amidst the Eggplant speckled Aumm Aumm or tender Linguini beneath blossoms and lightly bitter pesto, the Rigatoni no better than that from Michelina's while the meatballs atop spaghetti were damn near dehydrated while the larger ones served as a side were far more tender and less overwhelmed by spices.Almost as overpriced on zucchini blossoms as Wolfgang Puck's CUT while the flatbreads at Hearthstone far outperform the pricey Pizza all' Acqua, a 'best-bet' appetizer is more appropriately found in tartare or crudo, though those not trending to tomatoes as primi will also be impressed by the lightness of fried eggplant, the secondi selections of Chicken Parm or Veal Saltimbocca obviously a bit more substantial with the latter wrapped around Fontina and smoked Prosciutto actually quite stunning.Fairing well with the Lemon Chicken and what may very well be the best Piccata in town suffice it to say that the dry bomboli are a dish best skipped while Coconut Cake and Caprese Pie, both brought in from Peridot Sweets, are well worth ordering - as were the two celebratory cakes delivered for our family and friends outing.***At first looking like a place that may be interested in shaking up a stagnant Italian scene in the Western Suburbs it seems as though early on Salute has opted to instead play it safe, a bit of a shame considering the 'lightgroup' thumping music and prices not far off from those found on the Strip.So hopeful, but so disappointed. The food WAS good, however, there was a large bone in the middle of my chicken Parmesan, which I've never seen before, and did not care for. The risotto had noodles throughout it, which I've never seen before, and did not care for either. You can search, but you may never find a single smile on any of the wait staff's faces. Good luck. It was so flippin' loud inside the restaurant that you really can't carry on a conversation with anyone at the table other than the person directly next to you or across from you. There was 6 of us, so it made it very annoying. The water boys, bus boys, even the male manager on duty, we're all extremely attentive to the two ladies sitting at the table next to us in tiny dresses, fake lashes, big lips, etc... While we waited and waited for more water, and our empty dirty plates sat ignored for 20 minutes. Thanks for making us feel invisible because we didn't dress like Julia Roberts from Pretty Woman. Fail!
V3=I came here for lunch last week.  I saw the demo of the old Vocelli's that was here. The V3 sign went up not too long after.  This is a new 'line' of stores that Vocelli's is testing out, from what I hear on the local pizza blog.  V3 is essentially a pizza form of Chipotle, but better.    You start on one end of the counter and choose your crust.  Traditional, Multigrain, Gluten-Free ($1 more).  The fresh doughball is then put through a machine to be pressed out into a rectangle and pressed onto the pan.  Then you choose your sauce and all your toppings.  You can choose one that they have already put together as well. It goes into the conveyor oven.  While it cooks, you pay for it.  It comes out on the other side and goes to the finishing station where you can add some olive oils, fresh basil, more cheese, etc.  Box it up and take it to-go, or eat inside the 2 level spacious area.  For $8 per pizza, you can't beat it.  You can get several toppings too; I'm talking 5-6 toppings and its still $8.  You best be gettin' to this place before there is a line out the door!  New favorite lunch calorie splurge.  Because this is a "make your own" place, there is no website or ordering over the phone.
The Hash Kitchen=In the Gainey Ranch Shops at the previous Cuttlefish location. Good size restaurant and vertical modern building. The old oyster bar from Cuttlefish with the scooter seats are transformed into a Bloody Mary Bar.Had the Build Your Own Scramble with Chorizo, Italian Sausage and Mushrooms which was excellent. It came with a small container of hash browns and a home made biscuit.  Everything was excellent,  the chorizo was just right not to hot but with enough kick to give it flavor.  The mushrooms were plentiful and the Italian Sausage was very good. The Hash Browns were good and the home made biscuit was fresh and soft.The disk jockey playing the music was different in a breakfast / lunch place. Was good to liven up the place but at times was difficult to hear the other person talk.The service  was excellent as our waiter Ryan made sure everything was right and for having a party of 14 he handled every need without an issue. Was also a nice touch that the owner came by to talk with us.Will be back to try the lunch menu and especially the burgers that looked very good on the menu2.25 stars!Hash Kitchen, how could you do that to me?  I so enjoyed my Thanksgiving breakfast this morning- Coconut & Almond Encrusted French Toast (regular menu) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-hash-kitchen-scottsdale?select=-tDp5pqC4GK8Jcd2V23Thw AND Sweet Potato Pancakes (November specials menu), and a taste of a neighbor's Herb Fried Chicken & Waffle. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-hash-kitchen-scottsdale?select=WIpasuMFsjcohJts0NiP0g  My LavAzza cappuccino, topped with a bit of cinnamon, was nice, and service was friendly, helpful, and patient-- thank you, Jessie! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-hash-kitchen-scottsdale?select=nhAKp1QchJnn54LKpKFcKw  I placed an order of Chicken & Waffle to-go, which was placed in a styrofoam box and plastic-bagged, unseen by me (some places show me what the food looks like before putting it away), and put into a paper bag underneath my other two boxes of leftover entrees.  I left happy and thankful for finding a cool breakfast spot I could return to again and again, or so I thought.Coconut & almond encrusted French toast, minus the powdered sugar, $13.   http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-hash-kitchen-scottsdale?select=My9fTOguFl-GmBtYzzUTiA  Delicious!  Loved the texture of the French toast, but I'll be sure to ask for the maple syrup on the side next time, both to control the amount of syrup I'm using, as well as to keep the toast as crisped as possible for later consumption.  Would order this again!Sweet potato pancakes, with maple-cranberry reduction and minus the powdered sugar, $9.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-hash-kitchen-scottsdale?select=mP0A1XXVwiWGEua-h-ZDDQ  Pancake texture was fine, and color was pretty.  Not off-putting to me... Jessie warned me of the color, but I've had SW pancakes before, so I was ready.  Dish was disappointing, and the maple-cranberry reduction was its saving grace, and I almost was not able to try, because, as the photo shows, I was originally given a container of maple syrup reduction.  I pointed this out to Jessie, who quickly retrieved the right sauce.  She also apologized for the mix-up.  I would skip this one, unless next year's version includes actual cubed sweet potatoes in it-- the pancakes need more texture, either from sweet potato, or a fruit compote.Tasting of Herb Fried Chicken & Waffle... http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-hash-kitchen-scottsdale?select=WIpasuMFsjcohJts0NiP0g  Delicious!  I'd already had in mind to order one to-go, and I was happy to find it was tasty after having a sample.  (I'd offered the two women to my left a taste of the French toast, which one of them accepted.  It was her friend who gave me this sample to taste.)Front page of regular menu http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-hash-kitchen-scottsdale?select=QxRhMyJEAwpk28C-mlLRFwHours later, after returning from a long walk, I began to compose in my mind what I thought was going to be a 3.5- to 4-star review as I started to warm up some dinner- a little bit of Filipino food, nilaga, that Mom made and a little slice of the chicken and waffle, which I was looking forward to, since that tiny teaser my counter neighbor let me have this morning.  I placed the cut of waffle and chicken into the toaster oven for a few minutes, and then plated it.  When I sliced a bit of waffle off, along with what I thought was chicken, I was surprised to find mostly cooked batter and what looked like a pinky-sized portion of chicken- what the hey?!  So, I went into the fridge again to get more chicken and sliced another tiny portion, and then decided to take a picture of what was left... I was left deflated-- the high I had experienced this morning, now reduced to resemble the sad portion of breaded chicken sitting in front of me.  This morning, I left thinking I'd return, but now am not so sure...Atmosphere of THK is almost the same as its incarnation, Cuttlefish, and THK is under the same ownership.  The beautiful white marble counter and the wood paneling separating the bar/counter and the restroom area, are still there, and the DIY Bloody Mary bar was a nice touch!  (Jars of differing cornichons, pickled veggies, spices, hot sauces, and olives galore, and for those so inclined, there were even jars of wrapped long Slim Jims on each end.)  Jessie provided great service and impressed me with knowing the ingredients of the entrees I had questions about, and at the same time did not hesitate to get confirmation from the kitchen.  I felt respected as a customer- no condescension or other negative vibes from her to keep me from returning.  So why was I sent home with such a mediocre plating of chicken and waffle???  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-hash-kitchen-scottsdale?select=Q50wbVHZEOn2Hl6DOOp36AJust wanted to update my rating of Hash Kitchen.  I received a note from HK's owner, Joey M., who apologized for the mishap concerning my Chicken & Waffle to-go order and offered a complimentary C&W should I return.  My first visit was for Thanksgiving brunch, and I wanted to do an update, so I brought Mom with me for her first visit and my second on 12/10/15.  I wanted to dine at the wide white-marbled bar, but my Mom favors booths... Thank goodness we were lucky enough to get a great server named Candace, because her friendliness and service made up for the small table space we had after all of our entrees arrived!We ordered two cappuccinos, the Coconut-almond French toast (of course!), http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-hash-kitchen-scottsdale?select=aMB8TgvRGkpKakkjY9wfqg the complimentary C&W, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-hash-kitchen-scottsdale?select=WPwSYtAYVTfNB-QSv25aoA and an item on the December specials menu- Gingerbread Pancakes! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-hash-kitchen-scottsdale?select=qoqgj_MWZJgrGGWqNXaUAg  This came with a dollop of cream cheese frosting and topped with gingerbread cookie crumble.  Loved that the frosting didn't contain powdered sugar in it and wasn't too sweet.  I am all about textures, so I loved the cake-yness of the pancakes and the different-sized crumbles of the cookies, which had a wonderful gingerbread flavor and essence to them.  Slathering on the cream cheese frosting, which I'd say almost had a butter consistency, gave the pancakes a creamy component.  My mouth, nose, and brain were happy!  Mom really enjoyed the French toast, which surprised the both of us, because she doesn't care for coconut!  (Well, that can't be true, because she loves to make "ginataan," a dessert consisting of different tubers, plantains, and rice cake/patties stewed in sweetened coconut milk.  It's more accurate to say she doesn't like coconut aroma in health/beauty products, such as shampoos and lotions.)  Well, she had two French toast halves, as well as a quarter waffle and a third of the two large fried chicken breast patties in our entree.  Mom said there were three!  I might agree-- all I know is that I had at least three times the amount of fried chicken breast that I received on my first visit.  While I thoroughly enjoyed this visit's version of French toast, this was different from the first, which I felt was a little more tender, less caramelized.  I LOVED both versions!  If my future visits are as delightful as these two were, I feel like I could rate this breakfast eatery five stars!  Service is always friendly, and I haven't felt any negative vibes whenever I inquire about certain ingredients in entrees.  I do feel that HK could improve their mochas in their coffee menu by offering a higher-end chocolate product than the standard chocolate syrup (which contains corn syrup).  Mom did enjoy the mocha she had in lieu of the cappuccino that she didn't like, but she's not as picky about ingredients as I am.  I thank the owner Joey M. and GM Linda Rossow, who both came out and met us.  (Well, I asked if the owner was around, since he asked me to look for him the next time I visited.)  They were friendly and warm, and I could tell that they really liked what they have created with THK.  Linda told us about the BBQ place next door, which replaced Notorious Burgers.  Mom and I will have to try the brisket soon!
People's Republic=I walked-in and wanted to hate this place, but it wasn't really that bad. I was searching for a hot and new spot via the Yelp app and the People's Republic came up. This place is located next to the Harley Davidson Cafe and Chili's. I know, I know, how many red flags must I ignore before the ultimate demise of my palate.During my search I noticed a check-in offer for a free soft pretzel with the purchase of 20oz Porterhouse steak, really? I'm going to buy a thirty-two dollar steak in hopes of getting a soft pretzel, c'mon guys! Here's the kicker they don't even offer the 20oz anymore, now it's a 16oz Porterhouse. The style of this place is a tad confusing, it looks like sports bar, but with stained glass windows and a lot of brick, it could maybe pass for an English pub? My server (Jason) came by and was very personable and fast. He took our orders promptly and even gave us some recommendations and info about the menu.  Still nothing on the menu really intrigued me except for the loco moco balls. I also ordered deep fried artichoke and a breakfast pizza. The Loco Moco balls were interesting. Hand shaped rice balls with spam inside instead of hamburger meat, then deep-fried and served with a side of gravy. These were probably the best the thing of the night and that's not saying much. Way too much rice and hardly any spam inside, plus the side of gravy was clearly from a packet. The Fried artichoke was ok, but the dipping sauce that it came with completely overpowered any artichoke flavor. The Breakfast Pizza... Oh, the Breakfast Pizza. It was processed cubed ham, bagged cheese and sauce from a can, all on flat bread with a fried egg. Guys, when you have people scrutinizing every bite of every meal now-a-days it would really behoove you to not cut corners and get real products on the menu.This place could be good, but the food fell so flat that Wile E. Coyote even winced. The service was on point and the view from the patio was great, just not great enough to save my experience.
Boba Hut=A new launched Boba / Tea / Asian & Hawaiian Fusion on south Rainbow, Clean and Spacious. Its grand opening will be in November. Their brew tea is made to order from the TEAPRESSO equipment, and you can choose your preferred sweetness level and ice. But the flavored tea will come with at least 50% sweetness if you need to know. They also have various toppings for the customers to choose, such as jelly, crystal boba and popping boba (they all come with diverse flavors), egg pudding and red bean.. etc.We tried 4 different flavored tea and 3 dishes there: - Passion Fruit Tea with Red Bean: This is my favorite! Great passion fruit taste with the perfectly brewed tea, fresh and impressive. The red bean is soft and well-cooked, too.- White Peach Tea with Lychee jelly: Extremely fresh taste with rich flavored Lychee jelly, just perfect for summer time or to wake you up like the breeze.- Taro Milk Tea with Crystal Boba: Great milk tea with beautiful color from taro. Crystal Boba is interesting to try if you haven't had it before. - Black Milk Tea with Boba and Egg Pudding - I think they make the best Boba in town, chewy and not too hard. Too bad that they ran out of Grass Jelly, I am sure I will go back to try it next visit. Wish them to  provide the real milk instead of just creamer to make the milk tea tho. * Cake Noodles with Grilled Chicken: This is something new to me, and I haven't seen any other restaurants having it. It is really good, especially if you were a big fan of HK style noodles. The chicken is so juicy and tender. Highly recommended! * Drunken Noodles: It won me with the saporous basil favor!  * Mango Fried Rice with Cashew and Chinese Shredded Pork: Fried Rice is something simple but requires excellent skill to cook. I believe they have really talented and experienced chefs to make the fried rice flavorful but not greasy.Seems like Southwest side of Vegas is stepping up their boba game lately. Brew Tea Bar was a big hit, and now Boba Hut? Good spot for studying since they have ample selection of food and drinks, just like beloved Fresh Cup Café that I forever miss. ATMOSPHEREBright and clean. They have around six tables, all with comfy chairs. Music playing in the background added to the casual vibe but it was kind of loud in my opinion (maybe because I was there to study). They left both of the doors wide open and welcomed all the flies in. I was surrounded by flies at one point. Great.SERVICEMy cashier wasn't too friendly but they are still on soft opening so I guess it's ok for now. I was the only one there but it took at least 15 mins for my drink to be ready. Meh.DRINKI always order Jasmine Milk Tea whenever I try a new boba shop. I noticed that they have two types: Milk Green Tea and Jasmine Milk Tea. I believe Milk Green Tea is premade and Jasmine Milk Tea is made with freshly brewed tea. My cashier recommended Jasmine Milk Tea because it has more tea flavor. They only have one size for drink (24oz) and my drink came out to be $3.46 with their promotional discount.Wow! Strong green tea flavor, tad bit bitter and not overwhelming. I got mine at 100% sweetness, would get it at 70% next time because it was too sweet for my liking. I got their honey boba but it tasted bland. Boba was cooked perfectly, just wished it had more honey flavor. CONCLUSIONI went lenient on the star rating since they are still under soft opening. I am not really a fan yet but am willing to give them another try. Make sure to visit before November to get 20% off your order!I came back to Boba Hut for a study session. I am glad to see some improvements and this time around got to try some of their food. My final verdict is...this place is not bad, but not my most favorite.SERVICEA lot more welcoming than the last time. Unlike the attitude I got from a girl on my last visit, this guy at the counter was friendly and helpful in deciding which drink I should get. He personally handed the drink to me and told me I can make adjustments to my drink, which is something the girl never said in my last visit. DRINK/FOODDrinks I have tried so far:Jasmine Milk Tea- 100% is too sweet for my liking but still my favorite out of all the drinks I have tried. 5/5Whitegourd Green Milk Tea- ordered at 75% sweetness and added honey boba. Despite the ridiculously sweet taste of white gourd, I still tasted tea. I must say they brew some good teas here. 4/5Coffee Milk Tea-100% sweetness was good. Strong black tea with few shots of espresso. Perfect for all-nighter. 4/5White Peach Oolong Tea-just ok. I was surprised to see how much ice they put in this drink. Very subtle peach flavor and strong oolong tea. 3/5White Grape Oolong Tea-pretty good! Very light grape flavor and tea flavor but refreshing. 100% sweetness was bit too sweet for me. Unique flavor that I haven't had in other places. 4/5Cantaloupe Milk Tea-75% sweetness turned out to be too sweet once again. Similar to Honeydew Milk Tea, maybe a tad bit sweeter. 3/5Taiwanese popcorn chicken was something different. It came with seasoning which was on the saltier side. Their popcorn chicken, French fries and sweet potato fries are perfect snacks to order on the side.CONCLUSIONTheir teaspresso is amazing. No matter what flavor you get, you can always taste a hint of tea. I personally think their teas are brewed stronger than Brew Tea Bar or Kung Fu Tea. Try their teas! Also, go 50% or 75% sweetness level as many of the drinks they serve are extremely sweet to begin with.I came for the wintermelon milk tea and they sure met my expectations! Another great addition to Rainbow Blvd's awesome Asian food lineup. Boba hut offers different drink flavors, combinations, and toppings you cannot get anywhere else in Las Vegas. They are able to stand up to the stiff competition, no doubt! This is a Chinese Hawaiian fusion place serving up legit brewed tea boba drinks and Hawaiian comfort food.  Their tea game is strong and they use a Teapresso machine. The way to order your drinks is to:1) Pick your base ($3.00): black tea, black milk tea, green tea, or green milk tea. Available in hot or cold. 2) Add flavor ($0.50): plum, peach, mango, lychee, grapefruit, cantaloupe, pineapple, strawberry, honeydew, passionfruit, wintermelon, and peppermint! 3) Sweetness level: 0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100%.*Their drinks are pretty sweet here. Personal recommendation...I order either 50%-75%.4) Add toppings ($0.50): honey boba, rainbow jelly, mango jelly, lychee jelly, coffee jelly, red bean, egg pudding, grass jelly pudding, crystal boba, aloe, and popping boba. Other drink menu items include: specialty drinks like taro milk tea, thai tea, teaspresso drinks, and more! Also, slushes, non-caffeinated drinks, and smoothies.  If you have a sweet tooth, they have 6 different desserts like malasadas and various tofu puddings! Here's what I was able to try:- wintermelon milk tea w/ grass jelly- lychee black tea w/ honey boba- white grape oolong teapresso- cake noodles with chicken- popcorn chicken- spam and candy bacon musubi- crystal boba (sample) I thought their drinks were really good, but needed fine tuning on my part. If you are familiar with wintermelon tea, it is very sweet on it's own. I ordered this at 75% sweetness and it was too sweet for me. Next time, 50% should perfect it! Their tea is strong and very refreshing! The tea does not get muddled at all by flavors or toppings. Crystal boba is not for everyone. I did not like it. It's not starch based like honey boba. It is just a flavorless, clear agar jelly. Food was hit or miss, but shows a lot of promise. I am super picky with popcorn chicken and this was a miss. It was very bland and missing the seasoning that I am used too. No spicy levels either, just plain ol' popcorn chicken and some fried basil.  A Chinese Hawaiian comfort dish I was able to try for the first time is the cake noodles with chicken...and it was really good! The spam and candy bacon musubi was good, but could use a thicker piece of spam, due to the ratio of rice. I am pretty amazed with this place and the friendly and prompt service I received. All food and drinks came out in a timely manner. It is pretty spacious compared to other boba places. Some items I look forward to trying:- Hawaiian slush (pineapple, mango, li hing mui)- Pork belly loco moco- Drunken noodles- Saimin/macaroni soup- Desserts! I wish I could keep this place a secret, but I love supporting small business and so should you! :)Aloha spirit is here, service is genuinely excited to have you stop in, and they provide samples of favorite drinks! Though the name and menu mostly focus on drinks (hot/cold, caffeinated/non, tea, smoothies, etc.), there are also a few Chinese-Hawaiian dishes for small meals and snacks.The green tea with peppermint and boba, 25% sweetness, was strongly flavored and nicely sized, while the green milk tea with peach and coffee jelly was a little too weird for my taste. Added on a breakfast musubi (spam, egg, and candy bacon) and it knocked my socks off- would come back to try other dishes, quality of food is better than similar spots that offer quick-reheat options.
Public School 702=Usually when a place first opens it hits or misses.  This place hit!  Didn't even know this place existed until our friends insisted we leave our happy hour to do their happy hour.  We were not disappointed in the food, value or service.  All were great.  Great list of food and drink happy hour items.  Great school vibe with cleaver decor including the style of the menus.   They had jenga and beer pong on their big outside patio. Fun to play or even watch.  We will be back and recommend this spot to others!Terrible. Just checked out this place for the first time and I may never go back. Our waiter was very very nice but I waited 10 minutes before I was asked if I needed a menu. After 5 different servers came by my table I realized the management wasn't in order. My fiancé ordered a mojito which took 21 minutes to arrive. They were also out of three of beers I tried to order.Great idea at this place but definitely need to figure out how to run a team of servers. Maybe MAYBE will try in a couple months after they work out the kinks.I saw pictures of a mythical dessert called Nutella Cookie Sandwich. For a week, I've been imagining what it could possibly taste like and feel like until I've finally decided to try it.By the entrance is a glass display with sports trophies, Pom poms, Michael Jordan lunchbox, algebra book, calculus book and all things that would remind you of school minus the nun that smacks your hand with a ruler because this is Public School 702. You just get budget cuts.The menu would remind you of a notebook and the napkins would remind you of a notepad. Blackboards on the wall and the moon and planets above your head. Hipsters with their glasses, beards, sleeve tats and a beer. 90's hip hop playing in the background.We tried the grilled salmon, bison burger, chicken and waffles and the Nutella Cookie Sandwich. The entrees were just ok. The bison burger had a nice spicy kick to it but I also almost had an anaphylactic reaction because of an ingredient that wasn't on the menu description but was somehow in burger. The fries were not great.The Nutella Cookie Sandwich would be the only reason I'd come back here. So, you get chocolate chip cookies with Nutella schmeared on the flat side of the cookies, vanilla ice cream in the middle with a wall of bacon brittle. "I got 5 on it"...yup, it's only $5 that's big enough for 2-3 people.The service could use remedial lessons.Super excited for a new gastropub near me! Vegas needs to get down with gastropubs and open up more. First off, the structure itself is really awesome. From the patio, the decor to the vibes. They have an excellent craft brew selection and the food was excellent. No complaints on that!The only thing was service. I really struggled giving this place 4 stars but I had to go with 3 because our waiter was horrible. He was super nice, but he literally never checked on us and kept forgetting our drinks. We kept having to ask other waiters to get them for us. I don't think it was his area, but still, he wasn't busy. We went on a Sunday night at 8 and didn't leave until 10 because it took forever to get anything. That's a huge downer.For the beer: I had Dawn of the Red. It was amazing. It's a hoppier amber with fruit notes. It's now one of my favorites. Food: Fiery Calamari - very good and fried perfectly. It wasn't spicy at all though.Shrimp and Grits -  It was super tasty. The grits are more of a grits cake and it has so much in it with a ton of flavor. The sauce was very rich and spicy. Beef short rib with parmesan mashed potatoes - it was very good and the au jus gravy was very rich. The NUTELLA COOKIE SANDWICH. I'm going to be 100% honest. I'm not a dessert person. But when I saw this cookie on Yelp, I decided to go here solely for that purpose. And friends, it did NOT disappoint. It was the best cookie and ice cream dessert I've ever had in my life. The cookie was all gooey and soft. So perfect. Overall - I loved this place. I saw other servers being super tentative to their tables. We just got super unlucky. I would love to go again soon to try out other dishes and other yummy beers.We arrived on a Tuesday night, around 8 pm. It was surprisingly busy. We requested to sit on the patio and the hostess said it would be just a minute while they set our table up. I'm almost positive she forgot about us. We stood there for over ten minutes. Another hostess asked if we were waiting for someone, when we replied that we were waiting for the table, she looked around a little confused. When we were finally sat at the table that had been ready for almost ten minutes, we were handed menus. We looked them over and got excited about all the delicious options to eat and drink. Lots of craft beers on their menu (see photo). We asked for water while we looked over the menus. Another server came over and took our drink order. My boyfriend got the lavender vanilla and I ordered a Cabernet. We received our drinks, but still no water. My wine was fantastic and my boyfriends drink was perfect for sipping (I'm not really into whiskey, but it was good). We ordered the quinoa poblano prepared vegan with no cheese, broccolini prepared vegan with sautéed garlic, kale slaw with Brussels prepared vegan, and the brown bag potato fries (not vegan) but for my boyfriend;). Our server came to the table with water (finally) and some bad news. The poblano couldn't be prepped vegan:( it's prepped with cheese, and so is the kale shaved Brussels:(. Back to the menu... I opted for the veggie chili that's created with a mushroom thickening base (vegan). Granted it was 100+ degrees outside I wasn't super excited but it worked. My boyfriend ordered the chorizo Mac and cheese, since we couldn't share the poblano. Our food eventually arrived, but my chili had some cream on top... Had to send it back and wait again. The broccolini was amazing. Perfectly seasoned and sautéed to a crisp crunch. We finished it in no time. We were being attacked by bugs by the time my food made it to the table. Bug lights would be ideal for their patio. The chili was awesome. It came with a kale waffle I couldn't eat but it was filling by itself. Overall... It was a good meal. A little disorganized and patience was definitely a virtue we were practicing that evening. Would I return? Yes, happy hours on the patio with my laptop, school books, and boyfriend are going to be ideal considering they have convenient USB and outlets located on every booth. It's pretty new... Practice your patience... It has a lot of potential.This place is awesoooooooooooome!!!! Cool vibe, nice interior, lovely outdoor patio. Came here on a Wednesday night with some girls, and a DJ was playing some awesome 90's hip hop, alternating with some karaoke action. Bacon and cheddar tater tots- 4/5. Everyone loved it but I thought it was good. Summer succotash- 4/5. Good stuff but not to die for. First time eating succotash and apparently it doesn't get any better than this. Deviled eggs-3/5. Good but nothing special. Truffle fries- 4/5 Good but I've had better. Mezza plate- 3/5.  The waiter recommended this. I didn't think the hummus and anything else was that great except for the fried garbanzo bean that was crunchy on the outside. Shrimp and grits- 5 stars!!!!!!!!!!! Great sauce flavor, shrimp was perfectly cooked, and the grits patty that looks like a hash brown was absolutely delicious. I'd come back for this dish hands down. Phenomenal selection of beers available here. One extra star for carrying my fave beer...Greenflash IPA. Service was excellent. It's slow because it was busy, but our waiter Jared was super helpful, friendly, and made sure we were taken care of though keep in mind service is generally slow and our food took a while to arrive. Kyle, the GM came by to say hello and he was super nice as well. I like the ambiance of this place, and the DJ who played awesome music really made the night for me. Met a lot of cool locals. I'd definitely come back to try the jidori fried chicken as well as their burgers. Kudos to Jared for putting up with us ladies on our girls night out! ;)This teacher loves recess... AKA, Happy Hour at PS702! I dig the school theme, which carries throughout the restaurant décor (math flashcards clipped up around the bar) and menu (shareable portions are in a section called "study group"). They're a theme restaurant without being tacky about it.FARRO & BRUSSELS SPROUTS SALAD: surprisingly filling, this could be a late lunch. The sweet curry vinaigrette is interesting and there are a lot of contrasting textures.CRISPY CAULIFLOWER: The breading is super-thin and slightly spicy, with buffalo and bleu dipping sauces, served in a mini cast iron skillet. One of the better versions I've had, not greasy!PARM-TRUFFLE FRITES: You know you want them. They smell great, but let's get real, everyone has fancy fries these days, right? These come with a spicy ketchup and lemon aioli. Get 'em.SPECK & EGGS: Another dish everyone has, with the PS touch adding crispy prosciutto and a kick of spice.  Nicely creamy filling.CRISPY AHI TUNA TACOS: You can't go wrong with ahi. Tiny wonton shells filled with avocado and ahi, lightly dressed in ponzu. One of the lighter options, pairs well with the salad above.PB&J SLIDERS: The dish I was most excited about and the only one I was underwhelmed by. Menu only states "blackberry habanero jam with smoked bacon" and for some reason my eyes interpreted the word "slider" as a mini sandwich, most likely heated, on a thick challa-style bread. It's actually 3 typical sliders (mini patty and bun) with the two condiments gracelessly smeared on. With less PB and more J, this might have been palatable but dry beef + sticky PB = Nope.All of this, with a beer and tip, for ~$40 can easily feed three. Service was awesome when it was around, bar staff were constantly busy to the point of being overwhelmed. Our server apparently went home altogether, and after nearly half an hour of waiting around to close our tab, Kourtnie kindly took care of us. Not sure I'd come back outside of recess hours, but it's definitely fun. The food is approachable with some innovative twists rather than the standard safe staples I expected.Fun atmosphere and interesting spins on some traditional food.This space is a lot of fun and themed! Who doesn't enjoy a fun back to school moment? There's books, note pads, globes and so many fun decorations. The noise level is really loud so I wouldn't recommend coming here for romance or good conversation. We ordered some liquor and the jungle juice got me a mild buzz, thanks bartender! I love it when you can't taste it but you can definitely feel it!We decided on their take of deviled eggs which had a kick to them. I prefer good ol traditional ones which I can't seem to find anywhere I go. Next came the margarita pizza which again had a kick & again I prefer a traditional approach. I have to comment on the nicely done thin & crispy crust which I really enjoyed. And now we get to the charcuterie board...pretty damn great! Cheese with crackers or bread and jam or honey is my thing! I can't help myself and they offered a really nice balance of mild, sweet & savory items and I enjoyed them all. Our waitress was awesome tonight and overall we had a good time. I'm very interested in going back & trying more items. Note - they have a very large outdoor patio area but we couldn't do it tonight because it feels like hell outside.We tried Public School 702 shortly after they opened for business.We started with a couple of appetizers. I didn't love the calamari, but I typically don't enjoy fried calamari so that wasn't too surprising. The tater tots were the highlight of the appetizers. For an entree I ordered the cobb burger and chose the kale and brussel sprout slaw. When my food came they had given me fries instead, but quickly noticed their error and brought me the slaw. The burger was cooked perfectly and the flavors were great. Lots of bleu cheese and drippy egg and the slaw was on point as well. I enjoyed my meal quite a bit. The service was very attentive. Some were a bit overzealous since the restaurant just opened but I appreciated the extra effort. I'd be interested in coming back to try more of their menu and possibly happy hour someTime soon.Having wanted to try the original downtown LA location for the longest time, and just never getting the chance to, Public School 702 was probably one of my more anticipated restaurant openings this year. This new location in Downtown Summerlin sits on the upper level between Crave, and the yet to open second Shake Shack. It's a pretty large space with a lot of seating, a good size bar area, and an outdoor patio as well. But even with all that, it gets busy, and you'll likely have to wait for a table. For just 2 people at 7:30 on a Wednesday night, the wait still tipped 30 minutes.After being seated, we were handed their regular notebook style menu that has a quite a few appetizers, and all kinds of entrees from burgers to chicken and waffles. We were also handed a separate list of their current rotating tap beers. That's one of my favorite parts about PS702. Not only is there "normal" beer list all craft offerings, but their rotating stuff seems to be filled with unique and even some hard to find limited release stuff. If you're not a beer drinker though, they've got plenty of cocktails and wines too.Since there was only 2 of us and pretty much every appetizer on the menu sounded good, we decided to get a few items to share, and then split one dinner. We started off with some of the smaller items, the Speck & Eggs, and the Crispy Buffalo Cauliflower. At just $6 for either of these, they are must try starters in my opinion. The eggs were perfectly boiled, had a creamy yok filling, and the little piece of proscuitto was a nice salty, crispy touch. And the buffalo cauliflower was excellent. We've had a few different versions of it at other places in California, where it seems to be more popular, and PS702's was excellent. It's got a thicker breading and was served piping hot with sauce on the side, instead of tossed.The other appetizers we tried were a little on the bigger side. Their Mezze Plate is huge for $8 and includes 5 different things to pick off or dip in, and huge stack of thin, crispy pita-like bread. My favorite things were the marinated feta, and something I had never had anywhere else before, crispy chickpeas. We also really enjoyd the Chorizo Mac & Cheese. It was the most expensive starter we got at $9, but well worth it. The pasta was cooked perfectly, it's super cheesy, there's plenty of chorizo in it, and even though I thought it was strange at first, the salt and vinegar chips on top added both flavor and texture.By this time, we were pretty full, but our order of the Fried Jidori Chicken & Green Chili Cornbread Waffles was already on the way. Sadly, it didn't impress nearly as much as the appetizers, especially with it's $22 price tag. I personally really liked the slightly spicy waffle with the cornbread like texture, but the wifey wasn't a fan. And even though the flavor on the chicken was excellent, it was mushy and only one part, a leg, was bone-in. The gravy had good flavor as well, but because the chicken was soggy, it made the whole dish just overly mushy. Had the chicken been crispy, this would have been a huge hit for me.Unlike a lot of the other reviews, our service was excellent. We even found out later on during our meal that our waiter was in training. He did an excellent job though, and no complaints from me at all in the area.PS702 is a little on the pricy side, especially when you get drinks, but it's not out of this world crazy. With both of us getting drinks, then adding on 4 appetizers and a main entree, we only spent about $90 with tip. Besides the main chicken and waffles dish being a bit of a let down, it was well worth it, and I've got to say PS702 is one of my new favorites in Downtown Summerlin, so I can't wait to go back.My husband and I had a FEAST at Public School 702 on a Monday evening during happy hour. Happy Hour specials are available in the bar area and outside on the patio Mon-Fri from 3:30PM - 6:30PM. We ended up out on the patio with a nice view of Downtown Summerlin. I'm thanking my lucky stars we stumbled in here just in time for "Recess".  CRISPY CAULIFLOWER ($4 HH): The favorite of the evening. According to the menu, it's supposed to be served with blue cheese dressing AND buffalo sauce but we only got the blue cheese. The cauliflower is amazing! I'd highly recommend getting an order of these. 5/5 PARMESAN TRUFFLE FRIES ($4 HH): A large portion of flavorful fries, but neither of us cared for the lemon aioli. They tasted better straight up! 4/5MARGHERITA PIZZA ($6 HH): Lightly dusted with red pepper flakes and a pinch of basil leaves. Would have liked for there to be more basil and less charred black dustiness on the crust. 3/5CRISPY NAKED WINGS ($6 HH): Came with 7 or 8 good-sized wings and my guy thought they tasted great. We learned Public School 702 does not serve ranch and that their sauces are made from scratch. 4/5CHORIZO MAC & CHEESE ($7 HH): Sans the chorizo so we could both share. The vinegar potato chips layered on top added an unexpected crunch, as did the surprise arugula. The mac & cheese was slightly spicy because of red pepper flakes in the dish - wise choice. 4/5   FOUNTAIN DRINKS ($2.75 HH): My husband ordered a coke and it came in one of those cutsie bottles. Unfortunately, refills are not free. The extra coke was $1.50. What are we, in Europe? I just had water, and our server left a nice vase of water at the table so I could get all the refills I wanted. 2/5VIBE: Public School 702 has a class act theme, complete with menus that look like old school notebooks, chalkboards displaying the specials, and an awesome galaxy set up that would win any science fair competition in the main dining area. This new gastro pub feels industrial and trendy, and I love it here! 5/5 SERVICE: Selina was an awesome server! She checked up on us often and was super nice. 4/5Worth a Return Visit?There's still so many Happy Hour menu items I'm dying to try. And, I will definitely get the legendary Nutella Cookie dessert Yelpers are talking about next time I visit! Two thumbs up Public School 702.YELP 100 CHALLENGE 2015: #187I don't know how I haven't written a review for this place, yet. I certainly thought I had.I've been here twice now; once with the husband, once with a girlfriend for happy hour.My husband and I are calamari lovers. There is this calamari in Georgetown in Washington DC that is so good that it is the "bar" in which we judge all others. Public School's calamari is even better than that. It is THE calamari to compare all others. Perfectly tender, perfectly battered, and complimented with this ginger aioli, it is impeccable.I've had a burger, ahi tacos from the happy hour menu, and bangers and mash. They are all awesome. The BEST part of the entire meal, besides the calamari, is the slaw that you can substitute instead of fries. It is lemon-y, crispy, crunchy, and fresh. I would have licked my plate if not in public.Go eat here. You won't be disappointed.It was pretty underwhelming on my first visit. Again, I usually don't write a review after 1 visit.. but we were pretty unhappy when we left. It started with arriving at 10 pm after being told that the menu goes until 1 am. Not so.. late night menu started at 10 pm appearantly. There was a pretty mediocre selection of food at that point, but we figured we drove all the way out there so we would give it a try. This was after we were given the full menu. But here's how it all went.. We ordered drinks and found seats at the bar. Sat in front of a bartender that cleaned her well for literally 15 minutes without even looking up. Like, literally a foot from my face. Nothin. So my friend says, "what time do you close?" She says - "it's different every day," and she went back to cleaning. My other buddy says, "but we can still order food right?" She says nothing, hands us late night menus, and a full menu and continues cleaning. Without any other explanation. So we waited patiently as she polished the grate for the well, wiped it down and then walked away. it was bewildering. My buddy had to ask another bartender that was passing by if we could order. The bartender said, "well what time is it?" LOL! I said i's about 1030.. he said "ooooh let me check..." he says. He gave us a thumbs up from the other end of the bar but did not return to take the order. So when he came to our end of the bar again - about 5 minutes later to pour a draft beer, my buddy just started ordering out loud. haha.. I mean we had no intention of being rude.. but we were trying way too hard to order, like no-one was interested in serving us. We all had all worked and were there to eat. Very hungry. There were 3 bartenders, and literally 9 people at the bar.. we were the only ones trying to eat, and just could not get service. So now I'm watching the original female bartender that was cleaning her bar well in front of us. She grabs a glass water bottle.. drinks from it, then grabs a bottle of what appeared to be lemon juice from the bar well - and we all watched as she poured lemon juice into her water bottle. She did this by touching the mouth of the lemon juice bottle to the mouth of the bottle she just drank from, then put the juice bottle back in the well. I'm in no way squeemish, though that's just kind of gross, not to mention just wrong. So far - wtf. So the food.. we finally had a chance to order and were told only the late night menu was available.. after all that  time..we made some decisions and were informed we couldn't order them. This is were an explanation when dropping the menus would have been helpful. So we ordered Calamari, flavor was ok, not crispy AT ALL despite being fried.. I mean, literally soggy. Naked wings, all flats, no drums, which was weird but they were crispy and good.. deviled eggs.. good.. but the presentation were those of eggs that had been prepared and set out for a few minutes because the yolks were not looking so fresh, also we ordered truffle fries. The fries SUCKED. Seriously. Luke-warm, soggy, and served with preserved lemon aioli? I didn't understand that, I liked the aioli but not with these fries (that's just me).. They did not get eaten, yet taken away by the bartender without question as to whether we were done or if there was some reason it was over 75% unfinished. So there's that.Still very hungry we decided on the FIG and Prosciutto Pizza and Taleggio and Mushroom pizza. I'm not even going to go into it becuase both were very sloppy in presentation and just mediocre in flavor overall. Honestly. We ate most of the Fig and Prosciutto and less than half of the Mushroom Taleggio. What I will say about he pizzas -  is that the female food runner that brought the food over, literally shoved my drink to the side as I was trying to move the dirty plates from the previous course out of the way, then quite obviously tossed both pizza plates onto the bar and walked away. I spun around like.. wtf? my buddies both just laughed because we were so just over it at this point. She looked miserable, and was taking it out on us! haha.. it's laughable in retrospect, but I mean really?! She then walked to the end of the bar by the service well and started chewing on her finger nails. No Joke. Ok, so listen.. I am not trying to just be an angry diner about this.. but i'll say it again: There is absolutely no reason for medocire food, or service in a town like Las Vegas. There are too many choices where people actually want to do the right thing, and serve a quality product.This experience was a fail, and we are all easy-going foodie kind of people. I have no intention to go back to PUBLIC SCHOOL 702, soley based on the service. I would have liked to try the regular menu, but this experience was just a bust for me. Sorry - Happy Eating to you though!I absolutely LOVE this place. The food is great and the atmosphere is relaxing. No matter how full you get, you must save room for dessert. Oh - and you should ask for Vanessa to be your food server, she made our first experience at PS702 a lasting one! When I review, 5-stars are really reserved for all around excellence. If customer service isn't there and the food and atmosphere are awesome, I generally downgrade to 4-stars. So - kudos to PS702 for impressing me in all areas (e.g., food quality, service, atmosphere, cleanliness). We started with the Crispy Cauliflower. I know that might not sound very appetizing but it was. It comes with two sauces and the buffalo hot sauce is the bomb with cauliflower!Then we each had a sandwich. He had the Crispy Chicken Sandwich with French fries and I had the Colorado Lamb Burger with quinoa and feta. YUMMY! My burger was perfect. The bun complimented the burger and held up until the very last morsel was gone. Most buns seem to get soggy - not this one! Thanks for the suggestions Vanessa! With my meal, I had a pear cider and he had a bottle of sprite. I like the whole small soda bottles as it fits into the overall "recess" school lunch time theme. I just think maybe knocking off a $1.00 would make the PARENTS a little happier. $2.75 for a small 8 oz soda is steep, especially on a hot day when drinking five of those could easily happen. Good thing I decided to have a cold cider.I was pretty full after our meal but managed to get talked into sharing a dessert ("Please MOM please" - Grin Grin Grin). We ordered the Cookie Sandwich with Nutella. This was super good! I can't wait to come back during the evening or when it is a little cooler outside. The patio is beautiful!
Siegel's 1941=Four of us met for brunch this morning so we could have some of the breakfast menu and some of the lunch menu.  Items ordered were:Chocolate Nutella pancakesChallah French toastChicken and waffleFat Irish Green house made corned beef hash.Monte Cristo sandwichMiami Cuban sandwichPulled pork sandwichChicken pot pieEggplant parmigianaMeatballsBread puddingCaramel turtle pieThis is a 3 star restaurant working on it s fourth star.  As Siegel's 1941 has only recently opened, there are bound to be a few kinks but the restaurant is a solid place to eat.  The restaurant has been completely renovated from when it was the steakhouse for the El Cortez.  I was sorry to see that go, but I was happy to see what they did for a replacement.  While more open and more open to the casino than the former steakhouse, I'm glad to see how they've given honors to Benjamin Siegel for when he had partial ownership of the El Cortez.  Also prominent in the decorations are photos of his girlfriend Virginia Hill.Now the food.  The restaurant did a better job with the savory dishes than the sweet breakfast ones.  The Cuban, Monte Cristo, corned beef hash, and chicken pot pie were the standouts of the savory items.  The chicken and waffle was good as was the French toast.  The chocolate Nutella pancakes were a disappointment.  I expected something more than sloshing on some Nutella on top of pancakes.  There were a few glitches in the kitchen.  We ordered eggplant parmigiana but got chicken parmigiana.  We also ordered just meatballs but we got spaghetti and meatballs.  These are the issue which need to be worked out.Our server, Claudia, did an outstanding job.  She almost singlehandedly served the food to this hungry foursome.  I'd return for the corned beef hash if for breakfast and I will definitely return for the chicken pot pie.  I cannot give that high enough praise.Thanks to Mr. Farber for stopping by to check on us and see that all was well.  When they get some of their newness worked out, this can be a 4 star restaurant.Perhaps the most aspiring downtown hotel dining project in recent memory, and one that instantly sparked interest given the 24/7 concept within the historic El Cortez, it was with three friends that a four-course feast was enjoyed at Siegel's 1941, the sizeable space and immense menu showing promise of great things to come despite only officially being open for five days at the time of our mid-morning arrival.Inspired by Bugsy Siegel, an early investor in the El Cortez, with a soundtrack that veers vintage as Rat Pack classics float beneath gilded ceilings overhead, Siegel's 1941 features several touches harkening the era for which it is themed and with Virginia Hill gazing on over wood and red leather the menu is wide-reaching with breakfast, 'all-day,' and late-nite versions offered depending on the time, the transition from breakfast occurring at 11:00am proving the impetus for the party's 10:15am reserved table.Managed by Scott Farber and conceptualized by ESPLV, a design group behind several local restaurants with varying degrees of value, it would seem obvious that a concept as aggressive as Sigel's 1941 would be marred by a few issues in its opening days, and fully admitting that staff/kitchen transitions are one of those 'kinks' it was no-doubt a pleasant surprise that saw Scott diligently looking over his team throughout the stay, a middle-aged Hispanic woman providing almost universally impressive service given the complex coursing of the order, while a few kitchen delays and errors in execution seemed a bit more egregious - the chicken sent in place of requested eggplant, while a side of meatballs was instead served as the spaghetti centered entrée with a whole lot of watery noodles eventually going to waste.Beginning with breakfast, a few cups of coffee as well as orange juice, milk, plus a cocktail all brought along with water with refills rarely requiring a request, course one saw four plates delivered and while the flaccid pancakes with a simple spread of nutella could have benefitted from a bit more imagination both the chicken and waffles beneath peppery sausage gravy and the challah French Toast were as good as any served within a local diner, the use of 100% pure maple syrup a definite highlight, as was the quality of house-made corned beef acting to anchor a hash that featured golden-brown potatoes and lightly seared red peppers alongside a pair of poached eggs.Designating round two as 'the sandwich course,' it was on the advice of EatingLV that 'the city's best Cuban' was ordered, and served with fries on a silver tray one would be hard pressed to argue with such an assessment, particularly as relates to authenticity, as each ingredient melded nicely between layers of toasty pressed bread, the 'Monte Cristo' equally tasty and loaded with ham despite missing an opportunity to be the only deep-fried version currently offered in Sin City while the 'Carolina' pulled pork was unfortunately quite dreadful, a total lack of vinegar in either the pig or the slaw not at all resembling the stuff served in the Southeast while the bun was a soggy mess mere seconds after arrival.Receiving repeat apologies for a delay that stretched just under forty minutes at the midpoint of the meal, it was almost as though the extra time only served to confuse the kitchen since the aforementioned mistakes were sent out despite being correctly listed on the ticket, but thankfully not meeting any harboring a distaste for animal flesh as the enormous chicken parmesan was an exceedingly high quality rendition with light breading and good sauce while meatballs were unfortunately a bit dry and almost entirely devoid of spice, the pot pie undoubtedly proving a far more worthwhile bite as golden puff pastry formed a buttery dome over a creamy potage chockablock full of chicken and vegetables that outdid many more expensive versions found elsewhere in Sin City.Not yet dialing in the dessert menu, and as such unable to offer the Strawberry Ice Box Pie while also admitting that breakfast pastries are currently brought in from an outside source, the meal conclude with a duo of Bread Pudding and Turtle Pie, the former a dense block of brioche swimming in bourbon infused sauce beneath slowly melting ice cream while the later was an absolute must-order for those fancying caramel or chocolate, the filling a spot-on rendition of the inspirational candy with a graham cracker crust crisp too the tooth and heavy with spice.Already rivaling anything downtown for 24-hour fare, and only likely to get better with time, Siegel's 1941 is the sort of retro-rebrand that places such Roxy's at the Stratosphere have long aspired to emulate - a place where tourists and locals alike can get a good meal at a fair price, all while experiencing the old-school Vegas vibe that flows throughout its longest continuously running hotel and gaming space.Ahhhh, Vegas.While playing some video poker and waiting for some friends to arrive at the El Cortez bar, I noticed an advertisement for their restaurant, Siegel's 1941. The deal being offered was Las Vegas at its finest and I couldn't get it out of my mind. Starting at 11pm you can grab yourself an El Cortez burger and a beer for $6.00. My interest was peaked and you can bet your big ol' butt that I was in the half empty restaurant, waiting to be seated and hungry as all hell at a few minutes past 11pm. Okay, the service is horrid. One waitress, spread super thin, completely frustrated and ready to clock out... for life. She puts a lot of trust that the menu does a good enough job explaining the food because when she's at your table, she's all biz, no chit-chat. Thankfully I was already prepped and primed for the burger/beer special, which was not listed anywhere inside of the restaurant but verified to actually exist. I ordered mine cooked medium with a ice cold PBR to wash it all down. Twenty minutes later an impressive looking burger surfaced and I was quick to dig in. Where's the salt? Where's the pepper? Sure it was cooked to the perfect temperature and looked pretty, but damn, where's the flavor? A little seasoning could have bumped this burger up a few levels seeing as all of the other components were pretty decent. Hey, for $6.00 I'll still chalk this one up as a win.I had heard some good things about this fairly new rendition of the dining premises at the El Cortez Hotel that had formerly been The Flame, and finally visited to find out for myself.  While less upscale than its predecessor, the decor is still classy and now mob-oriented, and the more casual menu is now the very embodiment of comfort food.A Gulf Shrimp Cocktail was quite tasty and the equal of this classic starter at many other fine restaurants in town.  And a bowl of Matzo Ball Soup was really hot and excellent.  After I began attacking this concoction, I was ambivalent about having ordered it at all, because--chockful of chicken, carrots, and celery--this dish was really more an entree than a preliminary adjunct to another main course.  In the midst of the steaming broth was a large, nice and fluffy Matzo Ball, but the soup also came with Challah (Jewish home-baked bread) that was unfortunately dry and did not taste at all fresh.  A House Salad tasted good, and a generous portion of Country Fried Steak with Mashed Potatoes and Country Gravy was delectable and comforting.  All others at my table liked their ordered food as well.The decor, with big blowups of Bugsy on walls, was pleasant and somewhat historical.  And, while our waitress was rather stern and slow, our busboy provided good service.     I will be back soon to try other tempting offerings!
Blaze Fast-Fire'd Pizza="Make-it-yourself and we'll bake it in seconds!" pizza spots are popping up everywhere. This is a version I actually enjoyed! Crisp, chewy crust with a variety of quality toppings (goat cheese, gorgonzola, fresh basil, minced garlic), ready super-fast with great service, for a low price (under $8/each) and sized large enough to have a couple of pieces leftover.On opening day, they were super busy but every employee was peppy and positive. In addition to the pizzas, they also have some small salads and desserts (ask for the s'mores to be heated in the oven!).  Highly recommend adding pesto drizzle to your creation after it bakes, a vibrant and flavorful version generously applied.I have been eyeing this place waiting for it to open and it finally has! Hubby and I stopped by for dinner a few days ago during the grand opening and a nice girl at the door gave us both BOGO coupons. There were a few tables occupied, but no long line like some of my friends faced when visiting during grand opening week. They have a good amount of tables inside and they also have some tables outside. After looking over the menu and placing my order, I watched the pizza artists work their magic making my pizza and I was impressed with the variety of toppings offered. Pizzas are made in 180 seconds once in the oven and are all $7.65 each plus tax and you can choose from one of their signature pizzas or build your own choosing the cheeses and toppings you like. I ended up liking my pizza a lot and came back for dinner tonight. Service was just as friendly and I again enjoyed my pizza. Build Your Own - I chose classic red sauce, shredded mozzarella, ovalini mozzarella, cherry tomatoes, mushrooms and pineapples. The sauce was good as the toppings. I really liked the thin crust that was chewy yet perfectly crisp.Art Lover - This is one of their signature pizzas with artichokes, mozzarella, ricotta, chopped garlic and red sauce dollops. The crust was consistent with my previous visit and I again enjoyed my pizza. The only problem with this pizza for me was that I tasted no garlic. It's possible it was forgotten when the pizza was being made, but garlic is a flavor that stands out and it was hiding this time, boo! You can get your food to-go like I did and you can also place your order online. I'm a fan and will be back to try other pizza creations :)I came during the opening and was given some buy one get one free coupons. The pizzas are around $8 and you get unlimited toppings. The toppings all looked fresh and they have a hell of a lot to choose from. I got the spicy sauce on my first visit and it wasn't very spicy but I liked it. The crust is super thin but crisp and the amount of toppings I had didn't weigh the pizza down or make it soggy after cooking. When I came back the last time I had the regular sauce and a couple different cheeses than the last time and it was very good. Workers were friendly and upbeat though they could turn the music down it was too loud. They have tables also outside where you can eat.
Spartan Pita & Gyro=Holy Greek salad goodness, Spartan knows how to make a MEAN Greek salad! And that says a lot coming from me, i've had just about every Greek salad in the Valley! :) The veggies are SO fresh, chicken kabobs were grilled to perfection and the homemade vinaigrette dressing was light and perfect. We also got their "Greek Poutine" which was a bowl layered with french fries, feta cheese, Greek green beans w/red sauce (a Greek tomato sauce) and topped with feta again. I could literally eat these all day, every day, they were SO good! My boyfriend had the Gyro Cheesesteak and was raving about it the entire time that he was eating it. I had a bite and oh my goodness, it really was amazing. If you're looking for a quick, easy, fresh, and delicious lunch or dinner spot. This is your place!!!!I love having another Greek option in the 'hood...Spartan is a tiny little gem located on Thomas just East of 44th St, which makes it convenient for anyone who frequents the Target / Costco shopping center across the street.  I've now been a few times for take-out and while it hasn't disappointed, it's not somewhere I'd drive out of my way for either.  That being said, if you are close by and craving a Gyro, Souvlaki, or Greek Salad, this is your place!I've had both the Greek Salad with chicken and the Chopped Salad with chicken.  If you like dill, go for the Chopped!  You can't go wrong with the french fries or gyros either...Ingredients are fresh, service is friendly and speedy, and the prices are right.
Tropical Smoothie Cafe=i was really excited to have a tropical smoothie location closer to my home, but this location BY FAR is the worst. extremely understaffed & lacking in customer service. I have only visited a handful of times hoping that each experience might be a littler better, but i'm always left disappointed. food & smoothies arent to satisfaction, i ordered a wrap & there was HARDLY anything in it. it resembled a small taco! I waited approx 35 mins & all I ordered was a smoothie & a wrap. the customers AFTER me even got their food first!I feel for the one or two workers that i usually see that are alone busting their butts because they are working alone, manning EVERY single area of the store. I will not be visiting this location again, until there is better service & more employees. this is a new store, you're supposed to attract customers, not push them away. horrible!
MOD Pizza=Queue Taylor Swift!She wears short skirts,I eat pizza.She's cheer captainand I'm still eating pizza!*ahem*  So MOD Pizza seems to be everybody's sweetheart so I wanted to give this place a go!  Not bad, MOD, not bad.  The crust is thin and crispy and the toppings are delish.  The workers still seem to be new and some of those pizza artists had to peek at the sign to see what goes on each pizza.  I got a half-and-half on tonight's pie --- half Caspian and half "Squad Fave," Valencia.  I tweaked a bit on my Caspian and added some pepperoni and pineapples because I'm just the kinda gal that enjoys pineapples!  It was great.  I washed my pie down with their caramelized pea iced tea --- refreshing and not too sweet!Since this place is still new, everything is nice and clean.  There was a non-stop line the whole time we dined in so they must be doing something right.   With a lot of dining options nearby in this excellent strip plaza, this is the pizza joint of choice.While I'm not willing to replace my other pizza-made-my-way hot spot with MOD, this place is closer to home.Think Chipotle for Pizza! You order the size of pizza that you want and can add anything that you want to it, but the price remains the same. I LOVE that because if I had my way, I would have 10 toppings on my pizza every time! I loved that they had crumbled meatballs as a topping. They also have wine and beer on tap and a large, open patio that is perfect for this time of year! The pizza dough was cooked to bubbly perfection in a pizza oven. Since it is right around the corner from my house, i'll be back soon!It's okay.  It's the current fad in pizza concepts, where you pay one price and you can put anything you want on the pie.  It's been done.  MOD does it too.  The only real criticism I have is the crust.  I dunno.  tastes like cardboard to me.  But they do have great local microbrews on tap.  Sorta makes you forget the crust.
Chef Panda=I wasn't going to order thanks to the 1st review but I am glad I tried it after all. The orange chicken was crispy and sooooo good and the portion size was more than enough!The chicken broccoli was good as well, lots of chicken and veggies. Orange chicken is my favorite so far. My husband and I will definitely be ordering again! Finally good Chinese food that delivers! Chen wok is disgusting!
La Brume Dans Mes Lunettes=Brightly lit by natural lighting, impressive tall ceilings, and a beautifully designed space, when you step in, you will find a remarkable english tea room with the allure of modern coffee shop that will certainly charm you!The eclectic mix of glazed plywood counters, industrial tables, architects folding lights, wooden & steel draft stools, antique piano, buttoned chairs and tungsten lighting somehow all work well together. In addition to the esthetically pleasing surroundings, a lot of attention was paid to functionality including the availabilities of many conveniently located power outlets where you can plug and charge your laptop or mobile devices. The only odd thing about this place are the paintings - slightly disconnected.I did stop by for a quick brew, made from Kittel coffee beans, which was okay but was served in unique looking jade like mugs. I also couldn't help noticing the homemade sweet and savory creations that came out of this tiny but well equipped kitchen (induction cooktops, mini convection oven, euro size dishwasher...). Everything is made on the spot except for the bread and croissants that come from Guillaume, a fabulous local bakery. This place is barely two months old and will continue to evolve. I'll definitely have to return to indulge in some of the cooking and the unavoidable and time-honored ritual of afternoon tea, complete with silver teapot, fine china, crustless cucumber sandwiches, and Yorkshire pudding -- all at an affordable price of 27$ for two -- amazing!One question remains though: why is this place named "La Brume dans Mes Lunettes" - is it because the fog that builds up on eyeglasses when drinking a cup of coffee, is it because of the windows that steam up on chilly fall and winter days, or is it remnants memories of tormented past love stories that still linger?
Nova Kitchen Vegetarian=Wow! I am not a vegetarian in the slightest but popped over for a meal as I work nearby. I actually went 3 days in a row and I now might have a problem. Actually booked the restaurant out for my wife's birthday :-).The fresh made to order pizzas are incredible. Amazing amazing amazing.Had a chat with the gent who opened the restaurant and he's been working in Edinburgh restaurants a while and decided to pursue his passion of his own restaurant.So if you're looking for an amazing pizza (Quattro Formaggi for me) check this place out! Authentic Italian, with lots of love and passion in the service a food! Have to say it. Best pizza in Edinburgh!
Hachi=What a great izakaya-style spot! This plaza is rife with great offerings, and I'm glad to see the new dishes offered here: a mix of hot and cold tapas, with some sashimi and yakitori grill items thrown in. Their charcoal grill items are featured, but their fresh fish items are standouts for us!HOT DISHESThe grilled ika and grilled mackerel are both great! Nice blistering, perfectly cooked, simple and tasty. Daikon, lemon, and spicy mayo are offered alongside, but neither dish really needs it.  The chicken karrage was juicy, but not a standout. Crispy breading seemed uneven. COLD DISHESThe sashimi roll is perfection: fresh fish, rice paper, and shiso leaves, with a tasty yuzu sauce. The sashimi carpaccio features garlic oil, herbs, and seasonings- the crispy garlic in particular added great texture and flavor to the fish! What's not to love?! I am hoping they add more raw fish dishes and light rolls to their menu, their fish is very fresh and great quality. Will come back for sashimi. GRILL ITEMSVarious meats on sticks. The chicken thigh is tasty, with a nice char to it. They have a house-made chicken sausage that is fairly unique, and available with a poached egg dipping sauce- didn't much care for it. The offer two types of beef tongue, and the lean version we tried lacked the flavor we expected, seeming more like liver? The kurobata sausage and tomato/bacon are staples that are executed well. Grilled mackerel was the best dish in this section of the menu: simply prepared, crispy skin, moist interior, best with just a squeeze of lemon.DESSERTMatcha pannacotta is sublime. Cool, creamy green tea custard features a surprise red bean filling, topped with a dollop of fresh whipped cream. I prefer desserts that aren't too sweet, and this perfectly fit the bill. Their honey toast seems to be very popular though, and many groups around us ordered it.Service sitting at the sushi bar was attentive throughout our visit, with constant drink refills and small talk with the sushi chef. The interior space is modern, with both booths and the bar, and loud EDM/House style music, which was an interesting contrast to the simple, classic food. Looking forward to coming back!Owner of Ramen Sora and Sushi Twister now opened up an izakaya on Jones/Spring Mountain. They specialize in hand grilled yakitori (Japanese style skewered chicken) which is cooked over Binchotan charcoal.AMBIANCE/SERVICEClassy elegant feel with loud pop music playing. Sushi bar counter sits in the center of the restaurant, with tables around which are sectioned off. Cool layout but chairs at the sushi bar was extremely uncomfortable. Neat that they have a purse hook under the table. Courteous and attentive servers here. Attention to detail/knowledge of menu were on point. FOODNot much of a variety or selection in my opinion. If anything, I would stick to their yakitori. According to their description, Hachi uses a high quality Binchotan charcoal which release large quantities of infrared rays, therefore making the meat crispy on the outside and tender/juicy on the inside. Yakitori Bowl-It's really a mini yakitori bowl. I would say it is the same size as the mini chasyu bowl you can get over at Ramen Sora. Yakitori was super tender but had a very light flavor. 3/5Pork with Negi Shio Sauce-pork belly was so juicy. I also liked the negi shio sauce. 4/5Umeshiso Yaki-I know Ichiza has a pork skewer with umeshiso which is exactly like this. This one is chicken and I must say I liked the umeshiso skewer here better. Stronger ume flavor and more shiso leaves. 5/5Matcha Panacotta-creamy green tea/matcha custard with red bean filling. I like the matcha panacotta at Sakana better but I still enjoyed this. 4/5CONCLUSIONEach dish was tiny and I personally think its overpriced. Food here was underwhelming but exceptional service here will round up my rating to 3 stars.Hachi is one of the latest izakayas to open up shop, taking up residence along the popular corners of Jones and Spring Mountain.  With ramen (Ramen Sora) and AYCE sushi (Sushi Twister) under their belts, the owners went a different route with their newest venture in yakitori. Greeted promptly and eagerly on a recent Sunday evening, the restaurant was a third full with Japanese-speaking clientele. Our waiter was thorough and energetic with explaining the menu and there was a bit to review.  We ordered a little of everything, but let's get to my favorites first. * Crispy Chips "Deep fried chicken skin chips with house seasoning" ($3) - Oh. My. Gawd. This had me dancing in my seat! Fresh off the fryer with a squeeze of lemon and I am having a party in my mouth. I love deep fried chicken skin and their version just makes me so happy. As a result, we added 2 more orders. Love love love! * Yamaimo Chips "Japanese mountain yam skin fried isobe style" ($3) - Having only experienced this dish at one other place, we were psyched to see it here. Yum. Yum. Yum. Can I get an Amen? Oh yeah! There's a limit of 3 orders a day since they don't carry a huge quantity of mountain yams. We were more than happy to claim all 3 for ourselves.* Ika Karaage "Deep fried squid" ($3.50) - A tasty aioli accompanied this dish.* Skipjack Tataki Hachi Style ($6.50) - This dish came from their specials board. It's loaded with raw red onions, which may not be something for everyone. I especially liked the shiso leaf, onions, and mayo(?) combination, but it was a little too heavy-handed with the Hachi sauce.* Assorted Sashimi Bowl ($9.98) - This came with about 10 pieces of fresh fish on top of rice. It didn't taste like sushi rice and I didn't expect it to be since they don't serve any nigiri here from what I gathered. This is a great opportunity to use their special soy sauce blend made with bonito flakes, so it's a bit sweeter.* Scallop Carpaccio "Scallop sashimi topped with masago, cherry tomatoes, micro cilantro and micro greens. Splashed with olive oil, white soy sauce, lemon yuzu, and yuzu miso sauce." ($9.95) - The scallop was fresh and bright, and the fish eggs were flavorful (although they seemed more like tobiko than masago). I wasn't the hugest fan of the micro cilantro and micro greens and felt the yuzu miso sauce took away from the clean flavors of the seafood.* Halibut and Sea Urchin Carpaccio "Thinly sliced halibut topped with seared sea urchin, green onion, momiji oroshi and yuzu ponzu." ($12.50) - Although delicately presently, it lacked something. The flavors weren't coming out as much as we would have hoped for this dish.* Tsukune with Oroshi Ponzu ($3.50) - It's made with ground pork and was surprisingly quite juicy. Their yakitori does take awhile, so I suggest putting those orders in early. They use Binchotan charcoal (versus a gas grill or regular charcoal), which means the food grills at a lower temperature for a longer period of time. Be sure to utilize their condiments, specifically the Buta miso which is made from miso and crispy pork discards.* Otsumami 3 Kinds ($5) - We received bean sprouts, squid and seaweed, and bonito flakes and veggies. It was a little uninspiring. It does change regularly though. We tried ordering their Match soft serve, but it was unavailable. Overall, food was good. I would come back just for the Crispy Chips and Yamaimo Chips for sure. I would request light sauce or sauce on the side for the sashimi dishes, but that's my preference. I would definitely be interested to see what other specials they offer and any additions to their current menu. Service was attentive and polite. Water glasses were constantly filled and they worked as a team checking up on us. Love that.Note: They do use peanuts as their chopstick holders, so those with severe peanut allergies should be aware!Items Selected:Tamago Omelet - GingerCrispy Chicken SkinGarlic EdamameShiitake Butter - Shiitake Mushroom with butter & soy sauceYamaimo Chips - Japanese Mountain Yam Skin fried with Isobe StyleIkayaki - Spicy MayoJuicy Chicken Karaage - Deep Fried Chicken thigh with house special negi sauceGround TsukuneCheese Chikuwa Tempura - Mozzarella cheese wrapped with fish cake and deep fried with tempuraPork Belly TareTeppan Beef Tongue - Tomatoes and Bean SproutsKurobuta Sausage - Ketchup and Mustard, SalsaAppetizer Trio - Eggplant Mustard, Tuna with Seaweed and Miso, Arugula NegiMatcha Panna Cotta - Red BeanHoney Toast - Vanilla Ice CreamLocated on Jones, in the same plaza as China Mama and Chada Thai, Hachi is a relative newcomer to the growing izakaya scene in Las Vegas' Chinatown and owned by the team behind acclaimed Ramen Sora it was with two friends and a four year old that dinner was enjoyed this past Saturday, the results a bit mixed but at times more impressive than Raku at a lower pricepoint and far less of a hassle.Spacious in layout, a center bar welcoming solos and those looking to experience a limited selection of raw fish cut to order, it was at one of the comfortable booths circling the restaurant perimeter that our group was sat and with service always nearby, pleasant, and happy to answer questions it was after a brief description of daily specials that a bakers-dozen items were selected, several ordered in duplicate with the total bill tallying just under $30 per person.Unfortunately one of those places to which "coursing out" plates is a foreign concept, despite several requests not to overwhelm the table, it was with a relatively limp and flavorless presentation of chilled omelet that the meal kicked off, but following this up almost immediately with two styles of fried crisps both the chicken skins and house-special mountain yam were lightly seasoned and virtually oilless, the first bold bit of flavor presented by garlic soaked edamame that permeated the air in a ten foot radius.Underwhelming again with buttered mushrooms that were tender enough, though not particularly well displayed beneath too much salt, it was with the whole squid that grilled items began to arrive, the tenderness of the cephalopod's flesh found beneath snappy initial resistance as a kiss of charred lemon added 'pop' with or without the spicy mayo addition.Surprised by the thickness of fried chicken thigh that was both tender and immensely juicy on a plate of  miso sauce imbued with smoke and onions the evening's most intriguing bite was soon offered by "Cheese Chikuwa Tempura," the thinly rolled fish layer not dissimilar to the flavor of salt-cod beneath light batter with a gooey mozzarella interior.Progressing to three items from the low temperature binchotan grill, all 'Out-Rakuing' Raku in terms of smoke profile and tenderness with the ground pork Tsukune particularly memorable amongst the group, it was with a bit less enthusiasm that the daily appetizer trio hit out table - the raw tuna well flavored while the rest were mostly throwaways, the daily special beef tongue marred by being overcooked by tableside searing, a Bill Walton quote-in-waiting about "letting the show get in the way of the game."Saddening the little fella at the table by informing us that softserve was unavailable it was nonetheless in two desserts that the evening called it an end and although the bittersweet panna cotta with an unexpected red bean core was a bit meager in portion considering the $6 pricetag, the $7.98 Honey Toast more than made up for it as the half-loaf was presented golden, buttery, and crisp yet at the same time still saturated with sweetness.***Excelling with some items while fumbling and frustrating with others that seemed slipshod in their execution despite otherwise good ingredients and intentions, Hachi is the sort of place where a good meal can be had at a relatively low investment while a more memorable overall experience would be better sought at Raku for those interested in esoterica or Kyara at a similar cost.
Ibby's Fish & Chicken=Fish, wings, chicken, and shrimp pretty much sums it up. The choices for fish are Tilapia and catfish. They have traditional or boneless wings, Jumbo fried shrimp, fried chicken, and chicken nuggets. They do serve a variety of different appetizers and side dishes to go with the meals. Now for my 2 star rating...I originally ordered Catfish nuggets. When my meal came out they brought me a whole catfish. I looked at my receipt and showed them I wanted the nuggets. They took the food away and began making what I ordered. Mind you the food is made to order and took about 15 minutes to make in the first place so now I have to wait another 10 minutes for them to remake my meal. When the food finally arrived they brought me my food and told me the have me a few extra nuggets. I thought that was a nice gesture but they let the same sides they had given me before on my place so it was not fresh and it was cold. I ate the catfish nuggets expecting it to satisfy the hunger pains since I had waited so long for my food to come out. What a disappointment. The fish was so bland, no flavor, no seasoning and smelled like it was fresh out the ocean. Beware of the fish I would not recommend. I was with 2 other people and 1 order chicken nuggets which were pretty good. We had to ask for sauce because they never asked us.  My other friend order jumbo shrimp. He loved the shrimp. This was probably the best thing out of everything that we ordered. It came with fries but the fries didn't have any salt on them and tasted like they were cooked in bad grease. The baked beans were hard and dried out like they had been reheated in the microwave several times. It's too bad this place didn't work out I was excited to see a new restaurant to try.  I will not be going back.
Gangnam Sushi & Grill=Maybe it was just the word Gangnam made me want to come here because it reminded me of that song. So this place is a Japanese/Korean restaurant. I heard the sushi was good and the Korean food was good so I tried it. I liked it. I will have to say that the Korean stuff is more the pricey side while the Japanese food is about what you would find elsewhere.I ordered sushi and Korean food. The sushi was good. The Korean tofu soup was even better. It had a lot of flavor and way more than the usual ones I find at other Korean restaurant. One thing about the staff is that they are so happy. Why are they so happy? I don't know. But they were happy and enthusiastic. If only they weren't so new and forgetful of things that you request.Well food and service was good and the decor was very intimate so I say it's good place to bring friends and dates! There's very few Korean places in Tempe so this place is definitely a plus to the area.(Lyrics - Psy - Gangnam Style)Oppan Gangnam SushiGangnam SushiOp op op op oppan Gangnam SushiGangnam SushiOp op op op oppan Gangnam SushiEh......Sushi & GrillOp op op op oppan Gangnam SushiEh......Sushi & GrillOp Op Op Op Eh Eh Eh Eh Eh EhOkay, with a name like that what song did you expect me to make a parody with......?I was a skeptic about this place, but being a New & Hot spot on my Yelp app....why not!?The place is not in the best location for a restaurant in my opinion.  I came here with a birthday dinner party.  Service wise I think they could improve; slow and inexperience.  I gather it's a new place and still might be getting it's kinks together however that's not an excuse I can forgive.  For our food we ordered the mackerel fish, Tiger & Spicy Tuna sushi, and the Bibimbap with Bulgogi.  The mackerel was cooked just right!  Salty to the bite and still retaining it's moisture; probably my favorite of the night!  Our Bibimbap was good, but I thought it was lacking in Bulgogi beef; probably another ounce or 2 of beef would have been welcoming.  I'm not a sushi snob but overall I thought the sushi was well plated and tasty.  I always enjoy a spicy and crunchy roll with some exotic ingredients.  Thus, we ordered the Tiger roll that included the Spider Crabs.  In the end, the 2 of us were pretty full and couldn't finish our meals.Overall, I thought the food very good and finish what I could.  Not a lot of drink specials, but no complaints.  However, I was surprised at the price they were charging for some items which I could have ordered at other places for probably $1-$3 cheaper. - Enjoy!
Mala Restaurant=Mala is a new Szechuan place, specializing in more traditional dishes, with a small selection of dim sum items. I stuck to appetizers and smaller tapas-style bites on my first visit but was pleased with the quality and service.BABY WON TONS IN HOT CHILI OIL: The best! Tiny, delicate pouches with a pinch of filling, swimming in a fantastic chili oil with bits of garlic. This was my favorite dish, and one I'll be coming back for.FISH ROLLS: Skinny rolls filled with fish and cilantro, wrapped in crispy won ton skins, reminded me of a fresh take on lamb cigars in Mediterranean cuisine. These were simple but good.WOODEAR MUSHROOMS: BF picked this dish, and he liked it. I did not care for the jellied texture of the mushrooms. These were seasoned with a slightly-spicy sauce and a lot of lemongrass. CRISPY SHRIMP IN GARLIC OIL: Five crispy shrimp,  with a savory chopped mushroom topping, nicely cooked. I did not care for the "garlic oil", as it did not have much flavor and lent the dish a greasy feel. PORK AND SHRIMP SHUMAI: These were served in the steamer baskets, and had thicker skins than I am used to. The dipping sauce was a bit bland, but the filling was generous and balanced. Throughout our meal, service was attentive and polite. They are still in the grand opening stage until the end of the month, and have several promising-looking entrees and hotpot dishes.Only a month new this restaurant is outside of the Chinatown area but has convenient parking which is shared with the business next store. The establishment specializes in spicy Szechwan entrees and the interior is decorated tastefully. I started off with a cup of wonton soup and followed with the seafood  hot pot which was loaded with fish, shrimp, calamari and veggies. The hotpot was so large I couldn't finish the entree but was satisfing. I'll be returning here next time I'm in town and try a lamb or a spicy dish.
Luke's Lobster=I love a good lobster roll with a side of Benadryl. I was excited when I first heard a buzz about a new place that serves lobster rolls opening up, Luke's Lobster. The food is tasty and comes out pretty quick. The menu is simple. They have shrimp, crab, lobster, clam chowder, lobster bisque, original potato chips, and salt and vinegar chips. Lobster Bisque:Chunky pieces of lobster. The bisque is creamy and delicious. 4/5Lobster Roll:Pretty generous portions of cold lobster on a buttery roll. 4/5Price is standard for lobster rolls. The only thing is since this is located in an open space outside Fashion Show Mall, you're subject to extreme Vegas temperatures: cold winter nights and hot summer days. We froze the night we went.
The Coronado=Its take-out Tuesday again. What to eat? What to eat? A quick consultation with Yelp and it's decided to visit The Coronado. What a lovely place! Located less than a mile north of the artsy Roosevelt row and looks like one of those house-type cafes that I would like to live in. Not many seats and a menu small enough to fit on a 5x8 card, but the important thing is that they serve jackfruit. Yes, honey. Jackfruit - a special treat for folk who like variety in their vegetarian staples.3 jackfruit sliders puleeeze! They held the mayo for me and still the bitty sandwiches were moist. Purple cabbage was crisp. Bread was lightly dry-toasted and soft. Perfect amount of fries, fried with skin on and not overly salted.Will come again. Sho'nuff!
Queen City Beer and Chili=Queen City Beer and Chili does not disappoint!!  I had been waiting for this spot to open up for a while since I see it every time I'm in Brevard court grabbing lunch- glad to see it finally opened.Went here for lunch so I could not partake in the beer, but I will definitely be back- either to grab a couple pints or fill a growler up to take home.Love the concept.  The two chili dogs I had for lunch were spot on.  I went with the meal combo 3 which consists of two dogs, a side, and a drink.   They do not have many menu offerings but they make a strong showcase of their chili using various food vessels. My buddy got the nachos that were made of their house chips and a ton of toppings (added bacon for a dollar fidy).  Super reasonable prices for the food - seems like the more Charlotte grows the more expensive lunch uptown becomes.The right side of the place is where you order the food, you can either take it out or bring it into the bar area where they have about 6 tables- or sit at the bar!  Modern warm wood covers the entire space and there is exposed brick on the bar side (left side).  Edison bulbs win the growler shades adorn the ceilings and give the bar a pretty great relaxed atmosphere.Staff was super nice and made sure we were happy with how everything turned out.  I definitely will be back to partake in the 20 beers they have on tap.
Franktuary=Nice big fat dog with some interesting selections.  Ordered a "Signature Frank" - BLT which was very good, with bacon, mixed greens, tomato and chipotle ranch.  The "Frank " was very good and enjoyed the toppings.  The menu also has a few salads, a few poutines and other sides.  We shared a Quebecoise Poutine that was OK, the fries were good but the gravy was a little cold and just not as good as I was expecting.We did not have any beer, but there were a list of 9 beers on tap.
Cheerful House Chinese Cuisine=The Skinny: delicious pan fried pork and cabbage dumplings which squirt juice in your mouth! The stir-fried dishes we ordered was good as well(4) service is excellent! (5) value: pretty good for a fast casual joint. (4.5 stars).FYI, this restaurant is tucked away in the same Plaza as the Smith's across from i-naba. Okay. I'll be honest. I was a bit skeptical with all the Crab Rangoon,  moo goo gai pan, Sesame chicken on the menu. But I must admit,  underneath it all? This place has some legit Chinese food.First of all,  their dumplings are not listed on their regular menu. They have basa fish,  vegetarian, and pork with Napa cabbage. You have 3 styles -  in soup,  steamed and pan-fried. All made in house and 8 dumplings will set you back $6.95.The pork and cabbage dumplings pan fried were our starters and boy, are they good! Literally the juice from the vegetables and pork squirt into your mouth as you bite into them. The wrapper was not too thick to detract from the filling inside. Delicious and tasted just like the ones we make at home. The basa fish dumplings (with leeks and ginger) we tried were also very good which we tried in soup. The flavor of the soup was okay but the main attraction,  the dumplings,  were pretty flavorful. We tried the braised tofu dish and the steamed eggplant with garlic ($8.50 each). The hubs loved the braised tofu. We appreciated the fact the dish had good wok hai and was not overly sauced like most Chinese joints. (Good Chinese stir-fried dishes should not be sitting in goopy sauce. End of story.) The water chestnuts were a bit weird for me but other than that the dish was well constructed and tasted great. I really liked the steamed eggplant dish with garlic. I never thought to just steam it like fish and serve it with soy sauce. It eliminates the amount of oil normally used to cook eggplant and tastes much healthier. The eggplant texture was pillowy soft and fabulous. Will have to try this at home. We also received two free smoothies per the Yelp check in promotion they have. The hubs got the green tea while I got the black sesame. Both were good but really for me the dumplings/food are the bigger attraction. Service was excellent,  friendly and attentive. The restaurant is clean and spacious, making it good for families. FYI, Monday to Friday, they do have lunch specials featuring Chinese American type food for $7.95 and set menus as well. As a more casual restaurant,  they do not have a large extensive menu like other Chinese restaurants do. However of what they do have, they execute very well. In reality, the thing that excites me about this place are the more traditional dishes they have here. Will definitely be back for more dumplings and to try other dishes. 4.5 starred review.Delicious, divine dumplings with perfect skins, tons of filling, and a great price. At $7/8-piece order, available in three varieties and three cooks (pan-fried, in soup, or steamed), they are easily the highlight here. The basa fish variety with leeks and ginger are subtle but better steamed than in the soup, which I found bland. The pork and cabbage is best pan-fried to juicy, textured perfection.But dumplings aren't all they do well here, the more traditional Chinese dishes are also a success. The half roast duck is a generous portion, with a lightly crisped skin and moist, flavorful meat, complemented by a thick, sweet house-made sauce. Lighten up your meal with a side of the garlic eggplant or Chinese broccoli. Will be coming back for garlic spinach, mapa tofu, and Chinese seafood gumbo (the dumplings are a given).If the food isn't enough to draw you in, this is also a solid place to snag a smoothie or boba: they have 100 options to pick from, and you get a free small on your first visit with Yelp check in! The specialty options with multiple fruits sound to be the best, they even feature an avocado-black sesame version.Do I need a reason to be cheerful? Absolutely not. But then comes along a business that makes me want to be more cheerful than I already am, and that place is Cheerful House Chinese Cuisine.What should I cheer on first? How about the hometown team aka the dumpling? Ok I'll start with that. Big, tasty dumplings. Ones that make you go "mmm mmm mmmm". They make pork ones, fish ones, and shrimpy ones. You know I'm all about that. And then some. And you get a choice. Choices are wonderful. Pan fried, steamed, or in soup form. Try 'em all. You know I did. Which one is the bestest? That's up for you to decide. I'm keepin it on the rizzle this time, so I'll go pan fried. They got some bubble tea dranks. I liked em, not too sweet for some of em. Chewy balls. Not too shabby. Shabbalicioso. To the max. Max Payne. In the membrane.Other then the dumpleroonies, they serve the usuals that you would normally see in a Chinese resto. But I gotta admit, it's hella lotta betta than most places. Had a ton of fun with the chow fun. It was good enough to make a nun run to the sun. No pun intended. Note: the mapo tofu is more soy based here than chili based you would normally find, but hey, it was good so I is are not complaining. You know what I mean, you know what I'm sayin, kid. Like it, good value and portions. Fits my palate, that's all I care about. JT says "it's gonna be maaay", all about them dumplings.
Pasta Idea=This is one of the newest restaurants in the Summerlin area.  Their concept is good and very interesting. You can select your pasta and the sauce you want. Their pasta is homemade authentic italian. You have about 10 different pasta options to select from. And over 20 different sauces... They have it all! The portions size are very generous, you will for sure have left overs! I went over for lunch and they had a lunch special of pasta and a sauce plus and drink for 9.99. However, the offer is a bit deceiving because you can only pick two or three sauces for lunch. The rest of the menu was full price.  So at the end we spent about 15 each, which sounds a bit much for a lunch entree. Especially when you can go to olive garden and have all you can eat pasta and salad for 7.99. The flavors were good, but nothing memorable.I'll be the first to say it: when I drove by, pulled up the rave reviews, and visited their website, I kind of scoffed at their claims of fresh-made pasta and sauces. Noodles & Co has been doing this for years, and we already have Mac Shack as a local version- same concept for all.But my dinner here was really pretty great- I dig the modern kitchen decor, and the service is charming with a prominent Italian accent and genuine warmth. You pick from a variety of pastas and sauces, and add on apps, salads, soups, and/or desserts if you so desire. Note that pastas and sauces/toppings are priced separately, so this can add up- it's no bottomless Olive Garden bargain. The mushroom ravioli ($5) was a generous portion of large, lightly-stuffed pillows. I opted for the pesto gorgonzola ($9), which was creamier than expected and quite rich. I would love to see them add a regular, robust pesto to the menu rather than just the cheesed version.Was a bit disappointed with the caprese salad ($11)- the tomatoes were underripe and flavorless, which didn't rise to the level of the the fresh mozzarella, basil, and other vegetables. I realize they're new, but until they can get a supplier who can provide fresh, ripe tomatoes, perhaps this should be sidelined or only featured as a special.Split the pasta and salad for a large dinner, gave the rest to my guy- along with the complimentary bruschetta that comes with each order. Giant amount of food, total was just under $30, with tip. NOTE: The lunch "specials" offer very limited, basic selection. Hopefully they will expand what is covered in this category. I currently cannot recommend it as a lunch spot, despite working nearby.

I love Born and Raised, for the simple facts that it's a sports bar, but doesn't feel or look like one. It has some style, great food, and no cheesy neon beer lights all over the place. The layout is like a orange 70's style living room with a massive wall of TVs, a fully equipped bar, and random seats for lounging and socializing. You can also get a portable speaker placed on your table with any game you want blasting out the play by play. I was here during breakfast, but wanted lunch so I went with chorizo quesadilla and split some Guinness Bratwurst Bites, which are bratwurst baked in puff pastry and served brown mustard. Obviously, I was going for super healthy lunch here. 'The Guinness Bites were good, but I felt like the Guinness gave them a flavor that I wasn't super stoked on, but the Chorizo quesadilla was piece of greasy spicy heaven. I probably could have eaten two orders of these. I also tried my fiancée's order which was a basic, "Bar Breakfast" ham, 3 eggs, potatoes, toast, served with a side of smashed red potatoes. Everything was very good and the mashed potatoes were a great retreat from the normal hash browns.    Like I stated the food is great, love the laid back vibe and the service is solid. I only wish they wouldn't allow smoking inside, I really f*cking hate that shit.  I will be back to try the, "Hendertucky Toast". French Toast with Fruity Pebbles, yabba dabba doo!Early this week my Yelp Friend Robert W received an ROTD (Review Of The Day) for this Born & Raised (B.A.R.) Henderson location and it seemed like the perfect place to enjoy watching the football game together. Last night we did just that! In the process of waiting for Thursday 5:30pm kickoff, I thought it would be fun to invite some others. For starters, one of my best friends had no plans and it was his birthday...so naturally I thought the more the merrier and sent out some Yelp Friend invites. Over a dozen Yelpers + 1s showed up last night to enjoy many tasty foods & intoxicating drinks, fun conversations & much laughter, along with watching the Cardinals beat the Vikings on a giant wall TV.Most of us sat in the "living room" area at a couple large tables we secured prior to kickoff. Others wandered off to the next room and bar area where there are more TVs, video poker, etc. The decor at Born & Raised is very hip and the overall vibe of this place is extremely comfortable. Although I did not take food photos, others in our unofficially unofficial Yelp party did. (see the photos section). We tried many of the 20 appetizers, sliders, beers, birthday shots, drinks, etc that accumulated to over $400 dollars. My favorite was their Buffalo hot chicken wings, taquito's and garlic pretzel bites.Our very friendly and attentive server named Channels was fantastic, and certainly deserved the generous tip we gave her at the end of the night. In fact, all of the staff here worked together well as a team and really showed interest in top notch service for all patrons.Next time I visit Born & Raised, I will probably try the "Challenge" seen at the bottom of their menu...to eat 15 sliders + 1 lb of Anchor Fries in under 1 hour. The prize is a B.A.R t-shirt and comped meal. I eat a ton and think I can do it, as the alternative is pay up $75 bucks! Look forward to returning again soon...See 2 photos below...YELP 300 CHALLENGE 2015: #297
O-my Sushi=This place is located in boca park and there's never a long wait. This place is nice and quiet. They have an all you can eat for around 25 dollars per person! They're selection is good and they have many yummy rolls to choose from!!!They may have changed the sign out front, but it's still Tokyoto Sushi- same staff and chefs, same menu. Instead of AYCE, I usually opt for a la carte or lunch specials- the lettuce wrap app is as close to a riceless roll as you'll get here, but they do allow you to order handrolls sans rice, for an additional $1 each.Lunch specials are on a separate menu. Even going during lunch, this menu is not provided upon seating. It's also not provided when you ask for it. I had to pull up their website menu on my phone before they brought over the lunch sushi combos list so I could order- kind of irritating. Other than that and forgetting my beverage for the duration of my visit, service was polite.The lunch combo #3 is my favorite: miso soup and two gyoza, plus your choice of two special rolls from a limited list. The given options are just okay, most of them are shrimp tempura rolls. The namesake OMy roll and the Aladdin roll are both fairly plain, and the rice fell apart where sauces were used.
Firehouse Subs=I love the sandwiches at the Firehouse Subs in Chandler so I had to check out the location in Tempe. We ordered a large size NY steamer. It was a huge size, easily shared between two people. The bread was soft with toasted edges, the meat, cheese and onions were a good portion and well balanced. The shelf to the side has a wide array of hot sauces which are labeled in levels of spiciness from 1-10. I also love the Coca Cola Freestyle here which gives you he choice of making your own custom drink. They even have holiday flavors now! Service was excellent and the staff came by to check up on us to make sure we had a good experience. Overall a good place for a sandwich.
Eastwind Sushi & Grill=There are very few restaurants that truly merit a 1 star review. Most restaurants have a redeeming quality. If the service is poor, sometimes the food is cheap. If the portions are small or the food is bland, oftentimes the prices are low.Eastwind has no redeeming qualities. 1 star across the board.Service: They have an awkward "half service" policy where you order at the counter and have your food delivered to your table and taken away when you leave it there after a few bites. Maybe there are some cultural norms I'm missing but the service is very abrupt. I was the only customer in the restaurant and after around 10 seconds of looking at the menu I was granted a scowling "What you want." Later she delivered food to the table without a word or a smile. I felt a sense of genuine antipathy, like she would have enjoyed stabbing me in the eye with one of their unwashed forks.Food: I ordered the Korean Beef platter. I read in a previous review that they failed some health inspections in January so I figured beef was safer than seafood. The plate sure looked delicious, but the first thing I noticed was that there was a paucity of beef and a plethora of noodles for a dish with "beef" in its name. Then I speared a chunk of beef and...ew. I'm a frugal shopper, so I frequently pick up 50% off "manager specials" at the grocery store for same day cooking. It's a risk, but typically you get a great deal on a perfectly good cut of beef. Occasionally I get unlucky though, so Im very familiar with the flavor of turned beef. The beef at Eastwind wasn't even manager's special plus a few days. It was plain rotten. It's the kind of beef that you find in a Cormac McCarthy novel that the protagonist, starving, downtrodden, maybe considering cannibalism, would still pass on. It's currently turning in my stomach. I hope I don't have to leave work early.Decor and setting:All the signs of a place slowly going to shit. Clearly this used to have owners that cared, it no longer does. The bathroom has that old piss smell you normally find in public bathrooms in a park, or back allies behind the dumpster at a dive bar. I used the urinal, it doesn't flush. Like I pulled the handle, and just nothing. I didn't wash my hands, because the sink looked like I probably would have picked up more germs than I would cleaned off. I doubt the new management has cleaned it once since taking over, and they're in dire need of a plumber. The menu is covered in blackouts and price changes, clear signs of a restaurant on the ropes and either too cheap or lazy to reprint. Christmas decor is still up, as is Thanksgiving decor.  Lightbulbs are out everywhere, and the equipment to change them sits in full view of customers gathering dust next to the fountain drinks. The kitchen is also in full view. When I was walking out I saw the chef messing with his cell phone, the cord resting on cutting board where my rotting meat was just cut.I had maybe ten bites, comes out to a dollar per bite. Left the rest in the table.This place is just the worst.Pros: literally nothingCons: literally everything
Shake Shack=Really good burgers which must be compared to In N Out and Five Guys to give the right perspective.  I grew up in CA and instinctively am biased against Shake Shack in favor of In N Out so this review hurts a little.Quality of Meat: Shake Shack - In N Out - Five Guys (from best to worst)Shake Shack the easy winner here.  Juicy on the inside and cooked at high enough heat to get some charring on the outside.  A really solid patty you wouldn't have an issue with if you paid $15 at a steak house for(besides expecting a bigger patty).  Five Guys, to me, has the worst meat.  It's bland and cooked at lower heat so there's nothing happening on the outside.  In N Out has some charring but the patty is too thin and not juicy enough.Quality of Bun: Shake Shack - In N Out - Five GuysThe Shake Shack bun is awesome. Soft and pliable.  It lets you bite down into your burger without all the toppings flying everywhere.  That's a problem Five Guys in particular has and to a lesser extent In N Out.  In N Out does toast the buns....I couldn't tell if Shake Shack did but definitely didn't taste the toast like you do at In N Out.  Still.....have to go with the Shake Shack bun.  If they sold that bun in any supermarket it's what I would buy to take to a bbq for burgers.Quality of Toppings: Shake Shack - In N Out - Five GuysIn N Out has the best tomatoes, lettuce, and onions.  However, Shake Shack has bacon, superior grilled onions, and other toppings like peppers which give you much more variety.  Five Guys has the most options and they're free...but I've always found their toppings to be bland, poorly cooked, and just not good.  Fries: Shake Shack - Five Guys - In N OutWell seasoned crinkle cut fried over at Shake Shack.  NOT a good value by any means as you get an average portion at around $4.  That's insane pricing.  In N Out has pretty brutal fries IMO.  Five Guys gets silver on volume alone.  But fries are too big which means you have to put a ton of salt and/or ketchup.Cost: Shake Shack - Five Guys - In N Out (meaning Shake Shack is the most expensive option)Shake Shack is flat out expensive.  For a double cheeseburger they charge around $10 vs. $3.50 for In N Out and somewhere in between for Five Guys.  I don't know why anyone would eat at Five Guys with the prices they charge.  Five Guys does have an awesome soda machine at Downtown Summerlin.  If you're price sensitive, Shake Shack is gonna trigger you.TLDR; Shake Shack has really good burgers and fries.  But it's very expensive for what is essentially a fast food experience.Downtown Summerlin has been a bit lackluster with food options (all promise, with lack of delivery), so I'm happy to see this place open up and solidly perform both in quality of food and service. I went during their opening week and was glad that the line wasn't our the door long. Our wait time was expected after ordering (not too long though), but it did seem like a few other folks were wondering where their food orders were. Both the burgers we got were solid and the bun finally tastes like how I remember the bun tasting in their east coast locations (something about the NYNY location was a bit off). I know people complain about the higher price tag, but I'm officially a convert... no more In-n-Out for me. I'd rather pay up the extra money and go out of my way for my fast food needs. There are also a few TVs in this location, that were a lot easier to view than the NYNY location. When we were done with our food, a nice, very tall, young man proactively offered to put our tray away, which I appreciated. Some of the things I noticed:Customers - geez,  clean up after yourselves a bit citizens of Summerlin! The workers do a great job bussing tables, but it kind of sucks seeing people really not give AF. Entrance - Not very wheelchair or stroller-friendly, and very tight. Summerlin parents, keep the lanes clear when ordering! (again, another complaint about the customers, but I think the business could do a bit more to ease the situation). The space itself is not as expansive as the NYNY location, and their is some but not a ton of outside seating, so you do feel a bit cramped when they are really busy. Restocking - the whole time while we were waiting for the food and eating, this employee took forever restocking the straws/napkins/condiments area and was in a ton of people's way. She definitely could have picked up the pace and finished doing that in 5 minutes or less. Get in, get out, and check on it again in 30 minutes. Hope this place thrives and more great places keep on coming to Downtown Summerlin!Shake Shack is a New York City better than average burger chain that has been around 10+ years and recently opened their 2nd Las Vegas location in Downtown Summerlin. Welcome to the neighborhood!My son and I came here for a wonderful lunch on Friday 10/30th to celebrate getting his braces removed after two long years!!*Good food**Nice environment***Friendly staff****Large menu selection"Shake of the Week" during this last week of October was called "Shackenstein" and I slurped the straw til the cup was dry!

Also, tasted very good!Lots & lots of calories consumed at this celebration lunch, and was kinda expensive at $42 bucks for just the 2 of us, but well worth the dining experience!YELP 250 CHALLENGE 2015: #246JUICY MELTY BURGERSI had the pleasure of coming here for a YELP ELITE EVENT which also made me want to come back! I typically do NOT eat burgers so if you can make me want a Burger I would have to say *bravo*The staff here are so SWEET & FRIENDLY although I will have to say the so called manager may want to watch what he is saying in an open kitchen... I went to the counter to ask for a piece of lettuce & the worker asked the tall manager guy for a piece of lettuce & he says " what are we... feeding a rabbit?" Ummm talk about turn off.... I am standing right in front of you... that will be my only reason for 4 stars.... They even have dog treats for sale as well which is freaken cute! Also came back here w/ come girlies to grab dessert & another manager that was at the yelp event was giving out little samples of the hot coco which we ended up buying! SMOKE SHACK BURGER $6.69 - the SAUCE is freaken awesome & it has a slight kick of spice which I LOVE since I'm not good w/ burgers... but that spice makes it all good. DBL SMOKE SHACK BURGER $9.95 - double the pattyCHEESE FRIES $3.95 - crinkle fries cooked to perfection & drizzled w/ cheese sauce SHACK 2 O $2.35 - part of the money is donated RED VELVET CHEESECAKE CONCRETE - RICH & CREAMY  but the least rich out of all the flavors!SEA SALT CARAMEL HOT COCO - this is my new FAVORITE place to get hot coco!! It is so thick & creamy & hot!!!The fast food playing field is changing drastically. The era of fast food chains getting away with serving mediocre food cooked in greasy oil with impersonal service in a sterile environment designed to get you in and out is facing intense competition from the newer generation of fast food chains. This new generation of fast food chains is being led by Shake Shack, Five Guys, and Smash Burger.    After hiking in Calico Basin and the streets of Downtown Summerlin, my brother and I were up for a post-hike dinner in Shake Shack. I had been looking forward to biting into a Smokestack burger. In recent times, I had visited Shake Shack four times and  developed an appreciation for their Smokeshack burger.    Just like downtown Summerlin is the future of the regional shopping mall, Shake Shack is the future of the fast food restaurant. My experience describes dining in a futuristic fast food restaurant. After ordering from the menu on the wall (not over a counter), the friendly cashier presented me with a beeper. Instead of waiting by a counter for other people, or hearing order numbers go off, the gentle buzz of a beeper went off when the food was ready. The dining room is an environment that encouraged me to relax. This is totally disparate from a sundry of the fast food restaurants walled with plate glass windows overlooking the highway where the psychological message has been to eat up and get back on the road. In Shake Shack the interior feels more like a casual full service restaurant than a fast food restaurant. From my table I overlooked a couple of close caption HD TV sets playing football and "Shriek." If it was a warm day, I could of sat outside in the patio overlooking the beautiful arroyo park in downtown Summerlin. Whether I sat inside or outside, there was an employee offering to dump my garbage. And if I really wanted to relax, instead of a Coke with my crinkly fries, I could have enjoyed a draft beer. Biting into a Smokestack burger was more than enough to make me relax.     Shake Shack has been consistent with quality. In similar fashion to the past three visits the Smoke Shack burger elevated my taste buds. That 100% angus beef between two soft buns were the delicious prime ingredients that complimented Applewood bacon, red peppers, and that mysterious Shake Shack sauce. The crinkly cut fries were good but not Nathan's greatness.    It seems that Las Vegans including yours truly Daniel. S love Shake Shack. But Shake Shack is doing a Winco business strategy where they build a couple of restaurants that require  people to drive a distance to come to them. Currently the only other Las Vegas location is in New York - New York.   Speaking of New York - New York, I want to clarify a major Shake Shack misconception. There is a misconception that Shake Shack is the IN N Out Burger of New York and they are all over the New York metropolitan area. Not true at all. I grew up in New York and never heard of them. Throughout my young adulthood there was a few locations in the city. Only recently did they expand to the Suffolk County suburbs of New York. They are totally different from IN N Out. Shake Shack goes for around $12 where In N Out is about half the price. Shake Shack offers several different items where In N Out offers a few. From growing up in New York, I feel thar White Castle would be comparable to IN N Out.  On the other hand what is the antithesis of a misconception is that Shake Shack is fantastic. With all the four star reviews including this one, it is foreseeable to walk into this futuristic fast food restaurant and set eyes on the "People Love Us on Yelp"  sticker.
Hamilton's On The Square=4 weeks post opening, Hamilton's struggled on a few fronts.  When we first walked in, the host stand was unattended and we had to wait for a waitress to seat us.  When the host did appear, he was wearing a buffalo plaid flannel and flip flops.  Not the best first impression.The table we were seated at was missing one place setting and flatware that was only corrected after we requested it after our first course was delivered.  Service was slow overall.  Food, on the most past, suffered from a lack of seasoning.  When we requested salt for the beef tartare, we were told that another table also asked for salt and that the kitchen was too busy.  When we pressed, we were then told there is a disagreement between chef and owner regarding salt at the tables.  We pressed again and salt was finally delivered.Hamilton's offers small plates as well as a few larger.  My girlfriend and I ordered:The aforementioned beef tartareLittle Gem saladGrilled OctopusDuck BreastBeyond the lack of seasoning, we thought the dishes were good but not great.  The beef tartare has small pieces of croutons mixed in but needed something with more crunch to be served along side of it.  The salad was on the verge of being overdressed.  We thought the grilled octopus was excellent, perfectly charred and tender.  However, I feel it didn't mesh well with the potato salad served alongside.  The duck was cooked to order (medium rare) but the shiitake puree was overpowered by the honey that was also listed on the menu.Definitely a bumpy experience for us and will need to wait it out for awhile to see how other reviewers fare.
Rally's Hamburgers=WOW. Worst fast food experience and worst fast food I have had in my life to-date. And I have eaten at Del Taco a few times. I had been to Rally's a bunch growing up in San Diego, and I had decent memories until this last Sunday. Now that this location (which had looked dilapidated for some time now) was open [again?], we decided to go and check it out. Also, my boyfriend had never experienced Rally's. Realizing it was newly opened, we figured it's going to be busy but it wasn't that bad. I have seen the McDonald's down the street busier on weeknight. We waited for nearly 10 MINUTES at the drive-thru speaker just to order. After the first 6 minutes, a guy came on and asked us to give him another second and he'd be right with us. Yeah...no. I was getting really annoyed, I mean I don't mind waiting, just communicate. You have a microphone attached to your face. When we actually interacted with the guy at the window, he was so distracted. There was even a manager there constantly at his register taking over who didn't interject or apologize or seem to be helping at all. When he went to hand us our food, he got distracted and even pulled it back, as if he messed up or forgot what he was doing, and then just sat there talking into headset, dangling our ticket-to-finally-go-home in his hands. I am like "disengage already"! (Hindsight, I shouldn't have been so hasty to accept the order.) We order two of the bacon crisp cheeseburger or whatevers and a medium fry (SEE PHOTOS). GROSS. These were like ABC burgers - already been chewed. I have had a better burger from an inner-city elementary school. And the fries, which they brag about being 'famous', were famously TASTELESS...and stale. Anyway. I hated it. Hope you don't end up like me. If you do go, don't look at the pictures because that's not what you're getting.This was the second time we went there. Had a less than impressive visit the first time but we figured with it being opening weekend we would give them a break.This time the service was just as bad. Upon placing the order for some combos we were told they didn't have drinks. How can a fast food place not have drinks? Then we waited in line for almost 10 minutes waiting to get served by a rude girl who seemed more interested in what was going on inside rather than dealing with customers.The food is mediocre and the large fries are a joke. Don't waste your extra money. It is a shame this place is ran so badly. We were hoping it would be like other Rallys we have been to. Looks like we won't be going back now.Man, oh, man, I just waisted 30 min for fast food...NEVER again. I wish I would have read the reviews before I was trapped in the drive through. People complaining about 10 min waits, I envy you. I started my timer after about 10 min of not moving and after I opened yelp. On top of that, not once while I was waiting, did the cashier say anything. In fact, he just talked to another employee. They didn't even bother to close the window. Forget $15 an hour, these guys need to get paid $4 an hour.
Fortune Seafood Restaurant=All gifts from the heart are not created equal...and Fortune Seafood Restaurant's fell a little flat (gratuitous reference for the 0.89% of the world that speaks Cantonese).There are certainly better options in Vegas for Dim Sum. The real crime is that the worst items we received were seafood items...your name has the word seafood in it...make sure it's fresh! We came in on a Saturday around 11:30am to find a relatively empty dining room with only a few other tables occupied. We had a sense that it wasn't going to be that great, but you can only judge 95% of books by their covers...plus we felt obligated to stay and write a review since there weren't a lot of reviews to go off in the first place. The service was great!...fast and attentive.  We ordered many of our favorites and few other items:Har Gow (Shrimp Dumplings)Siu Mai (Pork Siu Mai)Pai Gwut (Pork Ribs)Nor Mai Gai (Sticky Rice in Lotus Leaf with some mysterious substance)Hom Sui Gok (Glutinous Rice Dumplings w/ mushroom & pork)Daan Taat (Egg Tart)Liu Sha Bao (Salted Egg Yolk Custard Buns)Steamed Scallop Dish Almond tea bund with lotus seedWe generally eat all that we order, or at the very least take the left-overs home. There were two dishes that were bad enough that we didn't want to finish them: Har Gow (Shrimp Dumplings) & the Steamed Scallop Dish. The seafood was certainly not fresh, spoiling the dishes. The simple choice is to find a different restaurant. If you do find yourself here, without the options of leaving, you would do best to stick to the Pai Gwut (Pork Ribs) and Hom Sui Gok (Glutinous Rice Dumplings w/ mushroom & pork). Still there was nothing good enough to recommend outright and certainly nothing to bring us back.
Indian Bowl Cuisine=The $4.99 lunch special (offered Monday through Friday from 11 A.M to 2 P.M.) is what lured me in. Plus, I've been wanting to try this place out ever since I seen the "Now Open" sign. I love me some Indian food! Indian Bowl Cuisine is located off Maryland right across from UNLV in the Chipotle shopping center. This small casual restaurant has plenty of seating and offers quick carry out. I ordered at the register, the owner piled in the food in a styrofoam tray, and I was on my way. I was in and out within 5 minutes.   The lunch special comes with rice and one main entree. There's two different types of rice to choose from. I can only describe the rice I chose as tamarind rice. Most of the tray was filled up with this rice. For my entree, I got the Saag Aloo (potatoes with spinach in a spicy sauce). There was also Chana masala (a chickpea entree) as another vegetarian option. The potatoes weren't as soft as I'd like, but the spiciness level was perfect. I was going to order the vegetarian samosas but was told they take 10 minutes to make from scratch. Maybe next time.Worth a Return Visit?I'm glad to have another lunch option around UNLV, and I hope Indian Bowl Cuisine is successful. My meal was just okay, but super cheap! Can't beat a $4.99 lunch.YELP 100 CHALLENGE 2015: #174Located near UNLV, seems to be  solid lunch option for students and staff- many other reviews mention the lunch combos, but either they've done away with that or it's not available on weekends, because I arrived to menu of made-to-order entrees. I liked that there were so many vegetarian options, but without my favorite saag paneer available (or tikka masala, for the non-veg options), I chose the special of the day: lamb curry, with the cumin rice, and a samosa.Service was polite, food was made to order and packed up for takeout, price ($12) was reasonable for the portion size. I asked for a 6 on their spice scale (1-10) and found it quite mild, but the curry sauce was thick and there was ample lamb. Food had a little more grease than I had expected, and I poured some off of the curry rather than ingest it. Samosa was just okay. Quality is better than some of the other student-focused places on this side of the street.
Prairie=My dinner at Prairie a few nights ago was a solid 3.5 stars.  The negative first: it's overpriced. In my opinion they should drop the price of every sandwich and entree by 2-3 dollars. I am not someone who has any qualms about a spendy meal, but the prices here seemed a bit excessive.  My boyfriend had a $15 seitan hoagie that was good, but not, you know, Spak-Brothers-Good. Also my fancy grilled cheese could have been fancier, and elevated by addition of another type of cheese or a few more veggies to make it a bit less Basic.  I like the fried sage on it, though, and the salad that came with it was super-yum.  I have to give Prairie huuuge props for their solid vegetarian selection!  When I heard about the concept, I figured it would be another meat-themed Pittsburgh restaurant that would have one vegetarian option and zero vegan options on the menu. How nice to be pleasantly surprised by a number of choices, and I do really want to go back and try some of the dinner entree items.  I am also impressed by the whiskey menu, the quality of the cocktails, and that there are good happy hour specials.  We had both the house mule and the old fashioned, and both were quite tasty and well-prepared.  Our dessert-- vegan apple crisp-- was delicious!!  Seamless service and a relaxing vibe ensures that we will be back soon.
Rick's Rollin Smoke BBQ & Tavern=Finally all you tourists that just gotta check out the pawn shop can have some pretty good barbeque here. Now I dont know how Rick Harrison ended up with his name being included in the title but I can only guess when your barbeque is damn good you tend to gain some notariety. That and you were offered a spot in their new plaza-like setting. I guess its a win-win for both parties.Now for the food. I gave the original Rollin Smoke location 5 stars. Why? Because its a stone's throw away from Spearmint Rhino! Ok, maybe that shouldnt qualify but hay, making it rain does make one hungry so hoppin on over to RS should be a no brainer. Sorry to stray off the main subject there, as a guy, I tend to get easily distracted and strip clubs tend to be one of them. Unlike the original location, this new place does not serve beef ribs at the moment. The beef ribs are mainly the number one reason I go to RS because I havnt had anything like them anywhere. Here it is a limited menu. The prices seem to be marked up as well but that should be expected since they are technically on the strip still. What I ended up getting was the 2 meat combo ($19.99) which comes with a side and a drink. Your meat choices are pulled pork, beef hot links, chopped brisket, smoked chicken, or st louis ribs. Your side choices are bbq baked beans, cole slaw, mashed potatos, and mac n cheese. I chose chopped brisket and st louis ribs. As usual both meats were on point. The brisket was a little bit greasy this time around but still good. The ribs were tender and fall off the bone smoke flavored goodness! Mac n cheese was just ok.Some random useful info: When you order your meats, they will ask you if you want sweet barbeque sauce on it or on the side. They also have a spicy and a really spicy barbeque sauce but you have to ask for it. On the tables they have their standard barbeque sauce. They also have wall outlets everywhere for your convenience so you can charge your phone or laptop. Just like the beef ribs, they told me that they dont have wifi for now as well. There are tables outside. Locals get 20 percent off their order. Hours are 10 am to 10 pm everyday. There is a bar right above where they serve appetizers and alcoholic beverages.In closing, I dont understand why you would have a limited menu when this location is gonna breed surefire success. I would rather have you not open just yet in order to make it right with a complete menu. You cannot deny the people their beef ribs, outlaw burger, and smoked meatloaf not to mention fried catfish, more sides, and dessert. The marked up prices def will take advantage of you out of towners.Yelp 2015 Review #70 "Rollin Smoke aint no joke!"568 overall
Greens and Proteins=What can I say about Greens and Proteins?? I can tell you always been fan and this marks the third location in Vegas. I can tell you that every location the food has been spot on. They have a nice diversity of healthy options, whole create your own menu section, options for smoothies really enjoy, and never had bad meal. I ended up getting the Turkey Club Wrap with tofu fries. I think might have been the first time getting wrap. The best parts about it was instead of the normal wrap went with the spinach wrap. Talk about giving the wrap not only different flavor and look! I thought was prefect compliment for the whole dish. It had ample amount of turkey and love the dressing mixed in with the greens some fresh tomato. It nice size wrap one that filling. The tofu fries. Fried tofu especially hard tofu. Beautiful thing. It not only healthier but taste better then fries, Not at all greasy. It crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. I could order whole basket of fries if I cold. The seasoning they out on the tofu is addicting.You can tell not only from the sign that just opened plus get first review. LOL! It feels new, smells new, and things that tradition with the signage and logo. I believe this is the only location that the menu its electronic. I know the smoothies looked even more tasty. It rolls over couple times or least once. Each time keep showing different smoothie on the menu. It making me thirsty waiting or thinking about what am going order for lunch. I like the menu. They sell different nutrition bars Q-West bars to couple other brands. The cucumber water nice touch. Me not really fan of but hear it not only healthy but not many places that offer it. I would say probably about the same size as the other two locations. The service nothing but five stars for me. They greeted us right after entering, offered help with the menu if needed it, friendly, and love the positive vibes. The best part about third location is super close to the house. So now truly if ever need Greens and Proteins fix literally bike down the street or five min drive. Nice option too have in life!! =))))Groupon Alert! $6 for $12 - for this location and their Flamingo location (adding date for relevance: 9/05/15)I've been here twice to date -- once for a coworker lunch and again on a solo breakfast trip. I'm a fan of their Flamingo location since I'm trying to trim down and eat clean. I like coming here since this spot gives me options to choose from outside of ordering salads. On my last trip, I ordered their Green Ginger Limeade (green grapes, spinach, ginger, lime, and opted out of the addition of Stevia). I make green smoothies at home and haven't thought of this combo. It's naturally sweet and green grapes and ginger tone down the addition of spinach. It's a quick and tasty way to get your fruits and veggies in.  I loved the blend of flavors and strong ginger kick. This spot isn't just for smoothies or fresh juices. They offer up a health conscious menu - sandwiches, wraps, pizzas, burgers, salads and more clean eating grub. I've sampled their bison burger and chicken satay in the past and both have  been tasty options. The have a prime Southwest location and may be found within the shopping center (same one as Starbucks, Cracked Egg and Archie's) on the corner of Sunset and S. Rainbow.  I really enjoy having the option of grabbing a nutritious treat around the corner from our office. My coworkers and I have secured this spot as part of our lunch rotation. .
Pearlz Oyster Bar=My friend invited me to their soft opening night tonight. While I am aware soft opening is not indicative of their normal service, I do like to provide a sneak peak of what may to come.I have never been to the other locations and thus have zero frame of reference, but it seems like Pearlz already has its own small Charlotte fan club from patronizing their Charleston location. My overall impression by reviewing their menu is that it offers a good selection of seafood options at a very reasonable price. If you don't like seafood (or allergic), they have plain salads, a burger and a steak to choose from.My complimentary dinner started with half a dozen of raw oysters (this time from VA, $8.95 for 6 or $14.95 for 12). They were fresh and of good size but were little bland in taste. I was told they will have varietal oyster offerings (ex. West coast) which will be more expensive but tastier. My appetizer was the peel & eat shrimp ($12.50, 8 to an order, enough to share since they are the bigger shrimps). Slightly seasoned with Old Bay, they are good for the cocktail shrimp lovers. But I am spoiled by my prior fresh shrimps eating days, I found these shrimps to lack that particular bounce and "fresh from the water" taste. 2nd course I chose the Oysters Rockefeller ($11.95, 5 to an order). I may say this is one of the highlights. Very flavorful, not too cheesy, a hint of bacon but not overpowering. However I didn't see the crawfish/lump crab toppings as shown on menu description, but still a solid excellent dish.Lastly I chose the fried shrimp entree. The 2 side items semi stole the show - the homemade chips and the corn fritters. The chips (really chips, not fries) were perfectly crispy. The fritters were slightly coated in powder sugar, giving it a good contrast to the otherwise savory dish. The shrimps itself (I believe they are the same source of shrimps as the cocktail shrimps) were ok; the batter can be lighter in sodium and the weight. For $16.95 there was plenty of shrimps to go around.Ok... I lied, that was not my "lastly;" the last item I had was the cup of seafood gumbo ($4.95) I added at the very end.  And it is legit. Not some tomato based fake stuff. This is the brownish good stuff - how gumbo really should be made from a dark roux. I promise, you want a cup if not a bowl of this!Overall from the food standpoint, Pearlz offers excellent value. So shrimps are not their strength in my opinion, but the Rockefeller and the gumbo were both solid. The portion I saw on everything is good. The tuna tartare looked divine. Fried calamari tossed with peppers is on my list to try. Local beers on draft ($5) and $9 signature cocktails - tho alcohol license wasn't ready as of today. I think Pearlz is ready to shake things up in Stonecrest, and give the big chain restaurants around the corner a run for their money!
Chow=Items Selected:Kinda Chinese riblets - Bite size, bone in, pork ribs ~ hoisin bbq sauceShrimp dumpling - shrimp shumei with crispy bacon & dipping sauceCrab rangoon dip - Fried eggroll skins, ponzu citrus saucePho-style tofu - Cabbage, carrots, red peppers, enoki mushrooms, vegan pho-style broth, seared tofuCrispy southern fried chicken - Sweet corn mini muffins, pickled jalapenos (4pc)General Chow's chicken - Crispy fried chicken, ginger, garlic, soy, rice vinegar, sweet & hot chili peppersChi-'talian noodles - Bolognese-style ground pork sauce, carrots, cilantro, onion, mint over Chinese gamien (wheat) noodlesSweet corn mini muffinsSriracha macaroni & cheeseMama's rice puddingOld school banana puddingDirtLooking more vigorous than ever since losing nearly eighty pounds following gastric sleeve surgery, though still recognized by many to be one of Downtown's first true pioneers, Natalie Young has achieved a lot in her career launched at eat, so much perhaps that it was with too high of expectations that I sat down with two 'industry' friends at chow, the recently launched "Fried Chicken and Chinese" joint.Truly a Chef cooking from her heart, the legions of fans still waiting out-front of 707 East Carson each weekend a testament to the longevity of a menu that has never really needed to change, chow sees Young expanding Fremont East towards the sketchy borders approaching PublicUS and with The Bunkhouse soon to reopen plus another intriguing proposition across the street it would seem that she is again ahead of the curve, the repurposed space borrowing from Momofuku as well as Mission Chinese in its décor while still retaining a feel both homey and unique.Channeling music from Led Zeppelin to Prince with some 80's power-ballads tossed into the mix, chow's menu speaks likewise of a cross-cultural mash-up of small plates alongside more sizable mains, the names as well as the concepts at times straight from take-out Chinese menus while other dishes riff on tradition in a tongue-in-cheek hipster sort of way.Told at the door by a local 'critic' that the Pho was not to be missed, it was alongside three additional appetizers that our 6pm meal commenced and with servers thrice mistaking one diner's Sprite for water while another woman's sole duty seemed to be walking around stating - not inquiring - how good everything was suffice it to say that the tofu cubes in broth was at the very best forgettable, entirely bland and lifeless on its own and all the moreso when compared to the savory shrimp dumplings and sticky-sweet riblets, the cream cheese dip cleverly presented though decidedly light in crab.Pleasantly paced with good conversation filling the space in between bites as tunes were thankfully not played overly loud from above, it was next in three entrees and two 'highly recommended' sides that palates were entrusted, the Southern Fried Chicken well seasoned straight through to the flesh alongside cornbread so dry that it was virtually inedible while both the oiled up noodles and spicy offering from the General were pronounced 'perfect drunk food,' the sobriety questionable of anyone fancying limp macaroni that banks on Sriracha to make its sales pitch beneath a top that is cooked to a leathery tan.Going old-school Southern with desserts, all three from the menu ordered with Banana Pudding doubled up, those reminiscing of childhood stuff straight from the box are likely to enjoy the thickness offered by 'Nilla wafers and roughly chopped fruit while the "rice pudding" ate like a more toothsome Jewish Kugel, the 'dirt' is a jar mostly just Hershey syrup and crushed up Oreos no better that what can be bought in cafeterias or at the grocery store.** Only half-successful in execution, though admittedly early in ts run, chow will no doubt garner praise from locals if only for the city's infatuation with Fremont East and its charismatic chef while the food still has a long way to go - place chow in any other clinical context without the involvement of Downtown Project and you have the mediocrity of M&M Soulfood meets the lesser offerings of Spring Mountain Road.Although I still haven't chowed down at Eat, I decided to eat at Chow.I accepted an invitation from a friend to try a new downtown Las Vegas restaurant by chef Natalie Young, the culinary mind behind one of the hotter restaurants in DTLV. This welcoming space, located on Fremont St a few blocks from Container Park, is a foray into combining Southern and Chinese food. The adjoining lot seemed full or possibly off-limits, but I found some free-after-6 street parking around the corner on 10th Street (a plus for choosing dinner rather than lunch).The meal unexpectedly began with wings three ways ($12.00 normally) due to a kitchen error. They had prepared a dish without a destination, so they offered it for free to the new table, us. We accepted it, and I was grateful since I'd actually wanted to order it. The wings were large and looked impressive. The first bite, a chili garlic wing, was actually unimpressive. The meat was either underseasoned or freezer burnt. It could well be the former because the flavor of the meat wasn't that impressive in the Asian-style bbq wings (served with fried onions) or the southern fried wings, but the glaze and crust respectively were yummy. Like the restaurant did for the price, I'm just gonna write this whole dish off for rating purposes.Our actual orders came out at roughly the same time. The shishito peppers ($5.00) were quite good. The sear was good and the charred lime gave it a balanced extra dimension when squeezed carefully. The kinda Chinese riblets ($10.00) were fine on their own. They were tender enough but not falling off the bone. The hoisin bbq sauce was good, but the pork itself wasn't bursting with flavor or juice. Fortunately, the charred lime was available again and really elevated the dish. They really should just add the lime to the standard glaze and be done with it. Because of the lime, it's a must-try-if-you-come-here dish.We also revisited the crispy southern fried chicken ($10.00 for 3 pc). This time, the chicken came in the form of large drumsticks. The seasoned crust was as good as it was on the wings, and the meat seemed a little juicier and more flavorful to me. The sweet pickled jalapeños were a welcome burst of flavors and must be eaten even if you're heat-averse. However, the corn muffins were disappointing. They barely had a corn flavor, the crunchy top didn't have a substantial feel, and the interior wasn't as fluffy as I would've liked. Also, what's up with the toasted white bread under the drumsticks? Do something to it. Like they say on Chopped, transform it. Maybe even a thin layer of butter would've made it interesting. I ended up soaking up riblet sauce with it later on, so it did work out, but it has no place in this dish.Finally, I did try a small amount of the barley vegetable stir fry ($12.00) because a vegetarian tablemate offered to share it. I suppose it's pretty good as far as vegetable stir fry dishes go, but it seemed pricey for being a dish free from protein. I wouldn't necessarily go for it again either in veggie mode or with a +$5 add-on of chicken, shrimp, or pork.Chow's menu concepts are somewhat boring and limited in scope, but I would have given the dishes four stars if they'd been executed better. As it is, I can't say "Yay! I'm a fan." Plus, other little things like the inability to split checks (split payment is OK though) and the lack of hefty chopsticks (disposable bamboo/wooden just reads cheap to me) could also be improved.For now, I'm content with planning to eat at Eat and saying ciao to Chow.It's kitschy. I dig it. Diner-style setup with Asian décor touches like a dragon on the ceiling and matching lions at either side of the door, a menu that boasts both Southern staples and Chinese dishes, and friendly service. Somehow, it works.CRAB RANGOON DIP: A tasty deconstructed version of the dish. Not much crab in the dip itself, but the flavors worked and the fried eggroll skins as chips was fun.KINDA CHINESE RIBLETS: Super tender, drowning in a hoisin barbecue sauce. Mixed feelings on this. BF and I didn't enjoy these as much as we were expecting to.CRISPY SOUTHERN FRIED CHICKEN: Moist meat, crispy skin, dusted with what seemed to be ranch dressing powder? Odd but tasty, it added saltiness that the dish needed. Cornbread muffins were painfully dry, and I don't understand why the chicken is served on sliced white bread? I really appreciated that the batter on the chicken wasn't very thick. Ultimately this dish was just okay.SRIRACHA MAC AND CHEESE: Elbow noodles, cheese, a hint of spicy sauce, and everything nicely offset by a green onion garnish. I liked this more than I expected to, having mostly ordered it because of the low $3 price tag. Service was fast and friendly. The southern portion of the menu (save for the cornbread) seems to be executed better than the Chinese. I'm sure the menu will change a bit as they settle in and see what works and what doesn't. Hopefully the trio of wings (unavailable during my lunchtime visit) will make the cut for my next visit.
Bread Meats Bread=My prayers have been answered! There is finally POUTINE in Edinburgh!!! As a Canadian living in this fine city, there are days when I miss Canada's national dish: chips, cheese curds and gravy. But now I can walk over to Bread Meats Bread whenever my poutine-missing heart desires! I first came across Bread Meats Bread via a Google search for poutine in Edinburgh. No results - so I tried Glasgow. This is its second location. Right on lothian road beside the Filmhouse. You can actually smell the scent of beef on lothian road (and I don't think there's anything wrong with that!). I visited on opening day in the evening and it was busy. The staff were very friendly and welcomed me as soon as I arrived. My partner and I opted for a cheeseburger each and decided to share the poutine. OK - the burgers here are so damn good. I'm going as far as to say the best in Edinburgh (and hey they are well known to be the best in Glasgow!). The server asked how I'd like my burger: med or well done. Medium, obs.  A major plus for BMB is that they serve their burgers and food on plates! Real plates! (I'm so fed up of being served food on a chopping board). The burger was quite big, juicy and had lots of flavour.  The bun is also really tasty - soft enough to hold the burger but not too soft that it falls apart. The poutine is amazing and the cheese curds are real and authentic! They def passed the squeak test! My only gripe with the poutine is that they should use hand cut chips with the skin on them. But that's a personal preference! Anyway I'm so happy that Bread Meats Bread is finally in Edinburgh. If you are ever really hungover, then I recommend the poutine as your saving grace!
The Wild Vine Uncorked=I have very high hopes for this place.We arrived around 3:00 on a Friday afternoon and were pleasantly surprised by their happy hour specials (2-6PM every day) - $2 selected tapas (apps) and house wines for $5. We sat at the bar and I started with the Miner Chardonnay ($17 a glass, but worth every penny), while my hubby picked a draft beer (also $2 off during happy hour - so $4). We also had the bruschetta (you get to choose 4 of 6 options - $9 HH) and the "Pan de Ajo" (sourdough bread & roasted garlic - $2 HH).The bruschetta was good but be warned that it is not like Postino's - we could have each had our own, and for the $9 price it would have been worth it. We liked every flavor we tried except for the verde. The Pan de Ajo stole the show! A wonderful, warm, fresh baked (circle) loaf of sourdough (accompanied with a soft butter) and a half of bulb of delicious roasted garlic - absolutely amazing. The best $2 of my life.I followed my Miner Chardonnay with their $5 house / HH Concannon (sp?) house Chard and loved it after my taste buds forgot the complex (and amazing) flavors of the Miner.Being so early, we were surprised by the amount of people coming in, hopefully this means they will be a big hit and stay open for years to come. I cannot wait for the weather to cool down and to take advantage of their open air dining room to patio (one of those full wall windows that will completely open up to the outside). This place was MUCH needed in the 'hood.
Szechuan China=I feel very bad writing a negative review about a restaurant that clearly is popular. But I must be honest. A little over a week ago, my wife and I decided to try Szechuan China. When we walked into the place we were encouraged, because we were the only Anglos there. If Asians liked it, it must be good! And for all I know, it is outstanding according to genuine ethnic standards. The hostess was very friendly, as was our waiter, although he did not appear to understand that, when there are a gazillion items on a menu, diners should not be expected to order within three minutes of being seated. When our orders arrived (rather quickly, in fact), both were feasts for the eyes. Everything was great thus far.But that's where the feast ended. My wife ordered a dish that featured mushrooms and tofu. Although beautiful to look at, it was tasteless. We both decided that they must not have added any flavorings to it--it appeared to be just mushrooms and tofu, nothing else (except for, presumably, the cornstarch that created the lovely thickness of the sauce).My entree, a Szechuan dish featuring poached fish in a very hot chili sauce, at first impressed me with its zing. But after a minute or so, I began to taste the salt. Wow! I grew up with traditional Texas cuisine, which means that I was pretty much pickled in sodium chloride by the time I was in my teens--so saltiness is not inimical to my taste buds. But this was beyond the pale. I was still tasting the salt half an hour after I got home, even after rinsing my mouth several times with water. (I should also mention that the dish overflowed with oil.)Because we are impecunious, we never leave food on our plates at a restaurant; we even carry rather substantial containers in our car so that we don't have to ask for unecological Styrofoam containers. Yet this is the first time in our many years of marriage that we have left substantial portions of restaurant dishes on our plates. I was able to eat only about a third of my food before the extreme saltiness forced me to stop eating. My wife ate about a fourth of her entree before its tastelessness led her to stop eating. And we had absolutely no desire to take the leftovers home. I fixed some snacks for us after we got home to satisfy our still-significant hunger.To their credit, the kind folks at the restaurant offered to give us a discount (which we refused). We left a generous tip. We understand it's possible that we happened to order dishes that were anomalously poor. But we figure that, as rarely as we eat out, we dare not risk another fifty bucks by returning to Szechuan China.I'd give Szechuan China 2.5 stars if that was an option. The place is decorated well: quiet, neutral colors, with tasteful accents in richer tones. It's clean and grown-up in atmosphere. But, the food was okay -- not that good, not that great. The dishes offer quality ingredients, but the preparation of the entrees is uninspired and the appetizers average, with no real pop in flavor. We stopped in for lunch, since lunch specials offer a reasonable price at which to try a new restaurant. We were excited by reviews of authentic and spicy food focusing on the Szechuan region.The lunch special menu was made up of only Chinese American standard dishes, which was a disappointment. I ordered the chicken with garlic sauce and fried rice. My partner ordered General Tso's with steamed rice. We also had meat dumplings and the Shanghai spring rolls. We didn't get the soup, since a single-serving appetizer portion of soup was $5. The pricing overall is uneven.My entre, the chicken with garlic sauce, came with chicken, mushrooms, broccoli, and other vegetables. It had little to no garlic flavor, but a pleasant late lingering spice. The entree had far, far too much sauce, and of the slightly too sweet, gloppy variety (so much that I was a little disgusted by it). My partner's General Tso's chicken was crispy, but again too sweet and little spice. The fried rice with my dish was fine, but lacked any aromatics and had no meat for flavoring either. We did not receive spoons with any dish to help serve portions onto a smaller plate.The meat dumplings were in the long wrappers pinched on one side. They seemed like they might contain pork mixed with chicken. They lacked in flavor -- no ginger, garlic, herb -- and were underseasoned. The spring rolls came with a spring roll wrapper. The server (whose English was not great) said he thought they had meat in them. He agreed to cabbage but seemed less sure. They had cabbage in them, but the meat was hard to see or taste. They had a decent texture, but didn't taste like much on the inside. The dipping sauce for the potstickers was vinegary and salty (soy base) with no scallions, garlic, or other flavoring. The dipping sauce for the spring rolls was standard sweet n sour. We asked for hot mustard and received carryout packets.The portion size for lunch was generous enough. The value was decent. The hot tea was good, but was not replenished by mid meal.I complained on the way out that we were automatically charged a 15% tip on the bill for a party of two. The woman at the front counter said they are doing this because in China tipping is not done and many Chinese who eat at restaurants here do not tip. I don't think it's legal for the restaurant to include the tip automatically in the bill, but I'm not sure. There are no signs or notices about it. I told her it would offend American customers. In our case, it also cheated the server, because we usually tip 20%.We have speculated that the many authentic Chinese menu items might be better prepared and interesting. There are many dishes with traditional ingredients (such as tripe). We can't confirm that they are any better, however.Given the underwhelming preparation and the weak service with the required gratuity, I doubt that we will be back.My partner and I were excited to try this place; we both love Chinese food and spicy dishes and we love supporting local businesses. I ordered from the vegetarian portion of the menu and the dish that came looked interesting but it was about 50% fish. I explained that I don't eat animals at all and since the dish was in the vegetarian section and didn't specifically say it contained animals, I was expecting a vegetarian dish. The waitress asked if I liked vegetables (really) and suggested a tofu and bok choi dish. I was a bit apprehensive because "tofu and bok choi" tends to be incredibly boring, but as the staff recommended it, I thought it must be a good choice. NOPE! The dish was swimming in translucent, viscous, whitish sauce that lacked any flavor besides salt. I ate a few pieces of tofu and they were bland and squishy, the bok choi was limp and similarly flavorless. I didn't bother trying the frozen carrot cubes or peas that were floating in the sea of slime. After a few minutes, the sauce began to congeal. It was, quite frankly, disgusting. A server asked if I liked the dish and, trying to be nice, I told her it was very bland and not to my tastes. She asked if I wanted to take it to go (uh, no) and when I said I did not, she picked it up, made a strange face, sticking out her tongue, and took it away. I don't know if she didn't see that I was looking at her or if she was sympathizing.I'm sad to say, the rice wasn't even good. My partner did like his dish and said the fishy tofu was pretty good but also had a slimy sauce. They charged us for all 3 dishes and a 15% tip on top of it! The tip wasn't indicated anywhere that we could see, so basically it's a rip off.I went with two of my co workers. I got the generals chicken. It was crispy. Burnt black crispy.  My co worker got the hunan beef which was 90% fat and cheap meat. The tea tasted like soap water. They brought the food out one order at time with minutes in between. When we got our check we asked to split it. They responded "no split check" and told us that there was a 20 dollar minimum if you use debit or credit cards.  Oh and the lunch didn't come with a egg roll, and no fortune cookies after the meal. Will never return.
Marco's Pizza=I watched as this new building was being built and wondered what it was going to be.  So far two food places with a third to come.I received a flier in the mail with coupons for Marco's and decided to use one of them tonight.  I called and ordered a White Cheezy which is listed under their Specialty Pizza section.  It's topped with 4 kinds of cheese including feta and has  onions, bacon, and garlic butter sauce on top.  I ordered the large which is a 14" pizza.  The person who took my ordered said it would be about 13 to 15 minutes and I drove the mile and a half to pick up the pie.  It was almost done.I paid and then brought the pie home.  It was large enough to serve two (cut into 6 slices), and there's one slice left for morning.  This will be my "hearty meal" before going to give platelets.The pizza was good.  It had a taste from the feta that made it different from other pizzas I've gotten.  There was a fair amount of oil on the cardboard box but the pizza itself didn't taste oily.The restaurant serves other things and they make pizzas that you build the way you want.This is a national franchise with several locations in Las Vegas.  Not the best pizza I've had but not bad either.
Maison Mignon=Ever since I got back from Taiwan, I havent gotten a single taiwanese beef noodle soup that tastes genuine, up until today. It's not featured on the menu but locals love it. The reason why this soup is legit is because the broth is made out of beef bones so it's packed with flavour, and behind it is a taiwanese chef who trained in japanese cuisine. Their tea is particularly tasty with the addition of roasted nuts and rice. The pancakes come filled with red beans or taro, but taro was the best. I have yet to try their Japanese menu.Went here last night with a small group of Yelp friends, people generally smarter than me about authentic Taiwanese food. All I knew was it had been chilly and felt like fall and I was craving soup, and man did this tiny hole in the wall deliver. We were the only ones in there on a Tuesday night, and the young couple who own the place and make all the food from scratch seemed perplexed but happy we were there, and eventually we got them to come out and chat with us and they were so funny and dear and great. We all ordered the beef noodle soup that Bozan X had told us about, except for the representative from the land of Vegetarian who was well taken care of as well, but will no doubt tell her own story. The soup was just outstanding. Broth that takes 5 hours to simmer to glorious savoury perfection, beef that's falling apart tender, crunchy veg and incredible homemade noodles that I could eat daily. I might go back this weekend for the mooncakes, and around Christmas for all the different cakes the mama chef so proudly told us tales of, and I'll be back before then many times for sure to sooth away the winter chill with these lovin spoonfuls.
World Of Beer=Now, granted, I was here once, and it was on their second official day of being open. That said, I can tell a few things right off the bat...+ Contemporary space; open, airy. Mix of stone, cement, and dark colors. + Tons of televisions around the entire bar/space+ Comfy couches in a little alcove near front door/corner+ Outdoor seating (small) with propane heaters+ Big - nay - huge, bar with a ton of seating+ Good for groups; bar hightops easily accommodate groups of 8+ A nice stage for bands (live music most nights!)+ iPads on tables show entire list of beers (drafts, bottles, by style, by ABV, by color, etc)- iPad interface is a bit unfriendly; fonts and colors make it difficult to read. For example, say you want to search for a certain type of beer (a great feature)... you click on the app's "style" icon and a list appears. Only the list background is white and so is the font. There's a very thin silver outline around letters, which makes reading them very difficult. I'd recommend an update.+ iPad Interface shows ABV and cost+ I didn't get an exact count, but they have a decent tap selection - maybe 35-40?+ Tons of bottles+ Full bar, otherwise (cocktails, wines)+ Decent food; menu is "pub centric" - small plates, flatbreads, burgers, sandwiches + few salads+ Pretzel: solid and huge. Easily shared with 3-4 people.+ Meatballs: delicious, but pricey... 4 small meatballs were $8- Tots: tasted like fresh from the freezer with drizzle of sauce, jalapeños, and too much sour cream. Not a ton of tots for price. Beer cheese sauce had strong bacon/smoke flavor.+ Flatbread: extremely thin crust (win!), decent toppings, fresh. Didn't need drizzles of balsamic and whatever else was drizzled over it. Good size for 2 people to share.+/- Loyalty club. Be warned: it cost $15 to join. You get a t-shirt, and you accumulate "points" based on beer purchases. Exactly what you earn isn't clear (just like the cost wasn't clear at first)... we'll wait to see what happens with this.- Service was dodgy/spotty at best on the second night. While it was busy, it wasn't *slammed* and yet our table regularly sat waiting for beers, had to reiterate our order on several occasions, received the wrong beer, received double beers, and just generally had "confusing" service. Multiple servers would check-in on us, none were certain who had done what prior. + Servers were incredibly friendly, just too busy and too uncertain/distracted. This will settle down over time, I'm certain. - Bathrooms are poorly designed. Men's restroom has a beautiful granite double sink set-up, but only one hand dryer. Two toilets, but one urinal. I visited the restroom twice, and there was a line both times, for both toilets and hand dryer. I saw several people leave without washing hands, probably because of the single hand dryer and the wait to use it.- It is *****LOUD***** in here. Like shout at your tablemate loud. I'd hate to see how loud it gets during truly busy times. If I had to venture a guess, I'd say the place was about 55-60% full when we were there, yet my dB meter showed 93-95dB of noise at all times. That's rock concert loud... They need to employ some sound dampening techniques/tools.- Happy Hour is advertised from 3pm - 7pm. And again, I think we paid full price on all of our beers. I could be wrong about this; I wasn't really studying the prices, but I know each of my New Glarus Stag Horn taps were $5. I pay $4-$5 "regular price" at any other establishment, so I'm not sure what the benefit of happy hour was. I would've asked, but our server(s) were so harried, it was really hard to learn anything. I'll be back after things settle down a bit. Still going to rate the place 4-stars because for the most part, it's solid. I know they'll get the other stuff sorted.
Mike's Kitchen=MIKE IS BACK! OPA!The West Side has a NEW "GEM" in Town!Mike is a well known Chef in this area and is well known for his Greek and Italian Cuisine. This restaurant prepares well made food. Sauces and many meats prepared in house. The front of the menu says they are a Bakery too so possibly some of the breads might be prepared in house too.I've been to his last restaurant many times and this new restaurant offers a bigger more varied  menu, wait staff, roomy comfortable booths in a nice atmosphere.I came in for lunch and ordered the Salmon Souvlaki Pita. The pita came with my choice of Greek Fries or Greek Salad so I went with Salad. Out comes a big fresh salad and soon after my pita arrives. The pita bread seemed like it was made to order as it was so fresh and hot and the filling was tasty. My husband had the house made sausage with peppers and onions. The sandwich was baked with bubbly mozzarella cheese. We were checked on several times by our server and by Mike.We will stop in for dinner next time as I remember the Myconos Chicken was pretty darn tasty.Portions are large and pricing is reasonable.They serve breakfast (8am), lunch and dinner 7 days a week.Give Mike's a try when your in the area!
Noodles & Company=My visit left my noodle a little limp actually all of them were limp.We ordered a small pesto with chicken, the pesto sauce was good but the entire dish was cold and the chicken was literally over cooked on a flat top grill with no seasoning and was luke warm.  We also ordered the Japanese pan fried noodles.  The pitiful sized portion (small) was not evev enough for my wife the noodles tasted old and limp and cold.  The flavors were ok. The curry soup was just ok.  She didn't even finish that and was still hungry when we left.  The staff was good.  There appeared to be an owner or manager there but he was the one cooking and I hesitated to complain about the food to him, with the thoughts that it would be taken personally. I would go back,  just not for dinner and not anytime soon.I'm just going to jump right to it. We paid $45 for myself, my husband and my 14 year old. We got 2 lg pasta dishes and a small. All were Terrible and cold. We order a side of potstickers which were hot in spots and ice cold in others. Not sure how that happens but that's when I got nervous. Being pregnant the thought of food poising is always in the back of my mind. The cheesy bread looked like cheesy bread that lacked cheese that had been sitting on your counter all night. Dry and not hot. We asked for our money back on the pot stickers and we got replacements to go instead. Wow, thanks...just what I wanted food to go?!?! Just horrible! Probably the worst place I have ever eaten. I want my $45 back please!I really wish I could give 0 stars. I came in here expecting a quick, easy lunch, but this was far from it. I ordered a salad of the menu, but boy was that a mistake. After I ordered, I patiently waited for 20 minutes, during which time I watch the salad girl make the two slowest salads I've ever seen made. It literally took her 10 minutes per salad. While I watched in disbelief, I observed not a single cook or line person, including what appeared to be the manager wearing gloves. Horrifying. However, I figured the salad girl was using tongs at least so I continued to wait. Then, it happened. She fumbled and dropped a bowl. I watched her pick everything up off the ground and he proceed to put dropped ingredients into my salad that I had waited close to a half hour for at this point.I no longer wanted my food or food poisoning after seeing this. I desperately tried to get someone's attention to cancel my order, but couldn't and actually had to leave with no food and out my money!!!I will never ever be back.
Viet Noodle Bar=Noticed the Grand Opening sign when I drove by last night, came in this evening for an early dinner. Got an order of fresh spring rolls with shrimp and a bowl of combination pho. Broth was good on the pho, but the meat was mostly fat. Rolls were  just okay, the shrimp was dry and seemed old.  Service was polite, prices seemed pretty low: total was under $15. Seems like they need to work on their quality and consistency.OMG!!!!! FANTASTIC food for a super low price, in a modern, ultra-clean, brand-new space. I LOVED IT!I had bún with grilled shrimp and chicken, plus veggie spring rolls, and everything was orgasmically delicious, fresh and flavorful. I'm not usually a meat person, but the grilled chicken and shrimp in my bún were out of this world! This chef really knows what he's doing....my understanding is it's one of the sons of the guy who runs Pho So 1, so I guess he came up the ranks and learned his shit from the right people.My friend had beef pho and hot tea, and the total bill was $27!! And they were BIG portions! Plus, the atmo was modern and chic, and VERY clean (restrooms too). I will definitely be coming back here again! LOVE IT!!!First timer here, arrived before the noon hour and secured decent parking in the large private parking lot. The intierior is large and there's several flat screens for entertainment.The menu is diverse and has a big selection to choose from. I ordered pork spring rolls and bun bo hue. My BBH arrived first and contained lots of protein and the broth was delish, but contained no pig foot or pork blood since they ran out of the latter - although the waiter did disclose this when ordering.The two pork spring rolls were yummy and the pork wasn't boiled like some places prepare.I tried coming back here for bfast pho but they don't open until 9;00 am but do stay open late till 2:00 am daily. I'll definetly be will be back to try their pho.Upon entering Viet Noodle Bar, I thought it's about as big at Pho Kim Long but cleaner and less chaotic - and I hope it stays that way and not just because they're new. The service has been the best compared to the other Vietnamese restaurants in town. The servers are friendly and attentive.Thit Nuong Cuon (Charbroiled Pork Spring Rolls):Tasted a little soapy probably because of all the cilantro. Not as meaty as the spring rolls from other places. 3/5Bo Nuong Cuon (Charbroiled Beef Spring Rolls):Nice grilled flavor on the tender beef. 4/5Pho Tai Nam:Flank steak and rare steak pho. Their pho comes in 2 sizes: regular and large. I ordered large but it's quite small. The broth is good and they're pretty generous with the meat. 4/5I was so happy they have soy bean milk! I love that stuff. Woohoo!4 1/2 stars. Arrived on a rainy weekday . This was my second visit to this recently new restaurant. Parking hasn't been an issue both times I've visited and the  interier is large, pleasantly eye appealing and spacious.I ordered the oxtail Pho which comes in only in one size. The pho was bomb, contained large pieces of tender oxtail and the broth was yummy,  not greasy and delish.Credit cards are accepted here and they offer free wifi.First impression of Viet Noodle Bar.  Definitely a very clean Vietnamese restaurant, with a lot of TVs showing sports game (at least at the time of my visit).  It felt like a pho restaurant and sports bar hybrid, without the annoying cigarette smoke and greasy spoons that are allegedly washed.  It is very roomy too, unlike many mom and pop type restaurants that error on the side of cramming more tables and chairs than the premise can comfortably accommodate.Based on reading the tips and glancing over some reviews, I knew I had to give their Oxtail Pho a try on my first visit.  Plus the outside temperature is cool, a bit breezy, almost fall-like weather, so a bowl of steamy hot bowl of noodles is perfect.The waiter that took my order was courteous, not too pushy, and gave me plenty of time to explore and take pictures of their menu.  I also didn't have to wait too long when asking for my bill or the credit card to be processed.  The Oxtail Pho also came out of the kitchen fairly quickly, but that is typical of any well run pho restaurant (it is not like they start cooking your from scratch the moment they receive the customer's order).  The portion is good, and there were several large oxtails in the bowl.  The flavor of the broth is good, and the oxtail was cooked fairly well (tender but not to the point that it will easily yield its tasty morsel with a bit of pressure).  I didn't feel that they skimped on the noodles either, which is great (since I always get that feeling at the most popular pho restaurant in Vegas frequented by tourists that's shall not be named). Next time I visit I will likely try one of their vermicelli noodle or rice plates (sadly i did not see any Broken Rice aka Cm tm dishes in their menu).My favorite Vietnamese restaurant in Las Vegas now. Parking is always available at the  shared private parking lot.It was a cold day so I went for the large oxtail and side of meatballs. As usual the pho was incredible here. The service and quality is solid too.Next time I return I'm going to try the grilled shrimp and beef plate for two for dinner which looks delicious.
All American Modern Sports Grill=Second time here.  They are still working out the kinks.  Food is good, nice atmosphere.  Prices are a bit high.  Drinks are coming out slow.  They have to kill the smoking on the patio.  With the doors open all around, the whole restaurant smells bad.  My wife said she won't come back because of that.  I'm still optimistic, but they had better kill that smoking lounge!  Need a kids menu also...  Let's go guys.  We need you up here...Update:So we finished dining.  Here is the final review as we won't be back.Food: Happy Hour sliders, HH quesadilla, kids meal, (2) cheap wines, (3) draft beers.  Total=$76.00 plus tip.  No thanks!  The service was slow.  Our server had tables at the back of the house and front door.  Sections anyone?  My beer sat at the bar for 10 minutes while I stared at it...  . We now have to wash our clothes when we get home for the first time since AZ passed the no smoking ban.  Whole restaurant reeked of cigarette and cigar smoke.  The place just seemed disorganized.  On the way out, two guys walking next to us said they sat at the bar and the prices were ridiculous.  They laughed and said they won't be back.  They went to The Living Room next door.  Too bad.  I had high hopes for the place.  The owner obviously thinks North Scottsdale will pay those prices, but he needs to understand that if they do, they expect a stellar experience and service.  They had better step it up.  They are a sports bar!
Haggen Food & Pharmacy=My husband insisted on going opening day around 10 p.m., (they opened at 4) and there was none of the opening day fanfare you would expect. It was tough to even locate an employee. Can I be both underwhelmed and nonplussed? Yes, thanks Haggen. There was a lot of empty space in this store. I liked it much better when it was Von's. Food is MORE expensive than Von's and Albertson's which are outrageous! Two bags of groceries were $90.00! I protested then decided to let my deranged husband make the purchase so I could rub it in when he was starving after exceeding the grocery budget. I felt violated by the outrageous prices. I had a colonoscopy that hurt less. We shant darken the door in that establishment ever again. Kiss my cash goodbye suckas! I'm going back to Trader Joe's, Sprouts, and if I'm desperate for something in the wee hours, Fresh and Easy.Worst rebrand in recent memory, with increased prices and worsened efficiency in every department from frozen food to pharmacy.  Not sure if the increased organic section is somehow meant to compete with Whole Foods, but it seems unlikely a place still pushing fast-food Chinese is going to lure the granola crowd across the street while the other changes are likely to send others over to Smith's or Albertsons for better prices and less hassle.I stopped here on the way home to see what it was like.  Now I have and I won't be back.  This is a very large supermarket that should be a Wegmans.  I was looking for three items and to check out the new store that used to be Vons.  What I found was a very over-priced selection of groceries.  I got one of the three items I came for.  The deli section is anemic at best.  As I walked around, I saw 2 litre soda on sale marked down to $1.79 from $1.97.  I can go to a dollar store and get the same thing.  Why on Earth would I take such a sale?Finally, it took more time to check out than it shoudl given the very few customers in the store and there was only one register open.I can see the for lease sign on the building now.Come west #Wegmans, come west!I've only ever watched one episode of the Walking Dead, but I imagine the whole series is basically like this store: virtually empty, save for a few dead-eyed folks (employees) walking around aimlessly, and never once greeting me, let alone asking if I need help finding anything. Clearly no one in charge here has ever heard of the concept of "competitive pricing." Everything is easily a buck more than it should be, if not double the price. If you're lucky though, you might find those bright orange "$1 Manager Markdown!" stickers- except they're only on the truly ridiculous items, like $8 acai juice and borderline-rotten meat.This place wasn't exactly a hotspot of business when it was Von's, but at least the employees were reliably friendly and the pricing was on par with other places in town. Haggen has nothing going for it whatsoever. I'll take the under on this place making the 6-month mark.Went to check out the market on the way home. It is like a cleaned up Von's - bright well lit and free of all the tall fixtures. Nice I like looking from one end of the produce area to the other. What I did not like was the customer service. It was awful . They made an error on my transaction and all they can do is say sorry we are not allowed to give refunds you will have to come back in the morning. Icing on the cake was manager Maryann saying thank you thank you thank you as I walked out the store. First impressions count with me. Treat me rudely and I will just not return. There are many other places that appreciate their customers and want our business and are willing to correct their errors immediately. Shame on Haggens.If I could do zero stars I would. My question is how can this place have produce worse than Von's and charge 2 times as much. They ruined my dinner tonight because I'm not driving over there again at 110 degrees outside.I've been to Haggens three times since they opened. Each time I bought much less than planned because of the sky high prices.  The  only area I found as an improvement over Vons was the seafood. Even there, I had to scold the clerk for trying to give me old chewed up seafood when there was obviously much better and fresher product in the display case.  The only people benefitting from Haggens is Smiths. They are getting all the money I used to spend at Vons.They've let staff go, and it's a ghost town in there at times. I don't think  the corporate powers-that-be understand the local market. Word is they are positioning Haggens as a competitor of Whole Foods and are still in the process of remodeling/restocking. In my opinion, We don't need Whole Foods pricing in this location, however, if they bring quality products at an affordable cost, then we're talking. But the way things are going, they may not last long enough to make that a reality.  The place looks nice (hence the 2nd star), but prices are ridiculously higher than before, and it's not like Von's was the cheapest around. Haggens needs to do something to show locals they will competitive and responsive to local needs. I miss the Friday $5 sales, and during a previous visit, staff weren't sure if the Starbucks was going to stay. Change is inevitable when there's a buy-out, but I hope when all is said and done, this place sells quality at more affordable pricing.
The Bourbon Cellar=I am a heat-seeking missile with new restaurants in my neck of the woods, so had to visit The Bourbon Cellar since it just opened mere weeks ago. SO MANY PROS with this place! It has a great ambiance, nice bar, contemporary/rustic vibe, and good music playing. All is positive on the ambiance.Chef came out more than once to ask us how everything was (HUGE PLUS!) Our waitress was nice and helpful. The service was great and welcoming in every respect.9 year old daughter ordered oysters, apparently flown in fresh daily from Prince Edward Island. We are huge seafood lovers, and have spent quite a bit of time in Maine and the east coast, so we've had the best. The oysters did not disappoint, they were fresh and fabulous with plenty of traditional oyster fixins'. "Tasted like the ocean!" according to the child. I agree, but she only let me have one! She also ordered a creamed corn side, which she licked clean. I thought aloud, "Where else could we go in Phoenix to have oysters like this?" We came up empty, so if you want an oysters fix, this would be THE PLACE to go!My other one had a nice shrimp and potato soup that she enjoyed. I had the scallops appetizer (2 scallops) plus a salad, and husband had a steak plus roasted potatoes on the side. All was great, and perfectly prepared.Unfortunately, the prices are utterly insane and really puts me at more of a 3 star rating. This isn't Binkley's or even Ruth Chris. The ala carte pricing is crazy. Once you pay $44 for the entree and add a side, you're at $60/person before alcohol, salad, or a dessert. Add in two glasses of wine/cocktail per person and you're at $85. We are not strangers to ridiculous-over-the-top dinners, via places like Binkley's Cave Creek and Joel Robuchon in Las Vegas, so this is not a pricing complaint.Only 1 out of the 4 of us ordered a proper entree. I had two scallops and a salad! One kid had a bowl of soup, that's it. And the other one had 12 oysters and creamed corn side. Bill with tip was nearly $250. A proper meal for each guest would total $100 for the entree + side + salad or appetizer, and two drinks. I appreciate that the oysters are flown in daily, and I appreciate the attention to detail in the food. The food we had was fantastic. Maybe mix it up and have a few "lower priced" entrees with the higher end stuff? To justify this kind of pricing, you have to have a serious competitive advantage. Give the people some bread, or do something to give them a warm and fuzzy feeling -- like they are truly getting a special experience found nowhere else. I don't know what the answer is for this place, but austere ala carte pricing always makes me feel stressed out, and there is no way I could justify a $400 + tip bill for four people on any kind of regular basis. Maybe this is supposed to just be a special occasion kind of restaurant, and not geared toward locals or families. However, I just don't think it's quite special enough - yet - to garner just special occasion guests. Please, please, please rethink your pricing and menu strategy. We DESPERATELY need a chef-driven restaurant up here, and the food is great!! I would be back in a heartbeat if the menu and pricing was revamped a bit. At this price point, though, I just can't see myself visiting again. I hope to revise my review soon.
Kahuku Poke and Hawaiian Barbecue=Soft opening . Limited menu. Only one kind of Poke.Ordered Ahi Belly, Meat Jun and 1/4 pound of poke to try. I have been to the name sake Kuhuku Superette. I lived in Kahuku before moving to Las Vegas.The owner said she only would sell poke by the 1/2 pound. Told her she could keep it. Poke Express is down the road. Brought the food home. Same sauce used for poke was used as marinade for belly.  It was over cooked also came with one scoop of rice and bland macaroni salad, Kim chee, and pickled radish $13.95.Meat Jun fell apart. Breading was just falling off same composed dish as Ahi. $9.95. Too little food for the money. Never saw any sign to make aware of the minimum purchase of Poke. Stupid to begin with. There is no try before you buy on that either. I got so many other places to go. Don't believe I'll ever come back here. I tried to talk to the owner, but she was adamant it's her restaurant.  I agree ...it's your restaurant and it's my money, I'll take my money else where. I said this before I will say it again. Great Customer service will always make up for food short comings. This place lacks both.The corner of Bermuda and Silverado is the place to be. Fresh&Easy, Walmart Neighborhood Market, Bank of America, Eco Cleaners, 7-11... I am always driving by or going to one of these places when running errands.I decided to try Kahuku Poke the other day after staring at it every time I stopped by Walmart for the past few weeks. I got a 1/2 lb of the Shoyu Poke to go and it was a little shy of $10. I recall the lady working the register to be pleasant and it only took minutes to receive my order!The tuna is marinated in a nicely seasoned soy sauce based ponzu sauce with sliced onion and chopped green onion and is INCREDIBLY soft!! It is marinated to perfection - the tuna literally just melts in your mouth. Tuna is cubed into large pieces and only a very few (bound to happen) had a chewy white stringiness to it.The tuna tasted fresh and not at all fishy. (Later found out they never use frozen fish, it's always fresh and shipped in daily!) It's a little pricy for the portion but not at all an issue because I was thoroughly satisfied with the taste. I look forward to trying their other poke next time!
Wingstop=After leaving my gym nearby, I had planned on getting a nice healthy meal but couldn't decide where to go. I drove by Ann and Losee and saw this place just opened. I'm not a huge chicken wings fan but for some reason, I can't resist Wing Stop's Garlic Parmesan wings. Goodbye, healthy meal; hello, cheat meal!I always get Garlic parm wings, hot wings, fries or carrot sticks. They're cooked to order. So, your wings are nice, hot and crispy. The quality of food and atmosphere are pretty consistent amongst all Wing Stop locations. But on the day I went here, the staff was friendly and super energetic.I'm also not a huge soda fan but they have a soda dispenser with a lot of different Coke products and flavors: Coke, Cherry Coke, Coke Zero, Diet Coke, Sprite, Sprite Zero, Cherry Sprite, Cherry Sprite Zero, Strawberry Sprite, etc. They have brewed tea as well.
Jjanga Fusion Pocha=NEVER DISAPPOINTED!!!Jjanga does a freaken AMAZING job of seriously getting my fix for as close to Cali kinda food or level of quality I may be craving!! Came here for soft opening & a couple times after grand opening! I SERIOUSLY so so so greatful to him for opening up a location that would please my cravings for KOREAN food!!! All the employees are freaken attentive & ALWAYS funny which is a necessity in a bar atmosphere! But they do have a great ROLE MODEL so would not expect anything less! My bigger AMAZEMENT is the freaken price point for everything!!! What the CHEAP!!!! like a poor college students dream come true for price point.. like competitive LA cheap pricing! I LOVE IT!!! because that means I could eat variety!MANUAL SSAM CHICKEN $8 - this thing is packed w/ FLAVORS! basically fried garlic chicken & it served w/ some lettuce & a spicy garlic hot sauce too! Light & fluffy & tender I would have to say.... definitely makes you crave more & more.HAE MOOL JUNGOL $25 - this is the LARGE portion of the JJANG PONG TANG which is normally $15 but this soup comes large w/ udon noodles. We had 4 people so this was perfect, although I do LOVE the jjang pong tang because I could enjoy the soup itself! So refreshing that I can't wait for winter.LEMON UNI $7 - I was so freaken EXCITED to see uni on the menu!!! It was so good!! On top of that... they freaken had FRESH WASABI!! I was totally pushing my luck & asked...  they just brought it out after they said they would check!PINEAPPLE SOJU $15 - ummm BRAVO!! most places they just mix pineapple juice & bring it out in a bottle... but here they bring it out in a FROZEN actual pineapple!!! Then as you scoop out the shot you could even scrap off some of the pineapple & create a slushy shot! Plus the frozen pineapple keeps the soju so refreshingly COLD!SOJU $10SAPPARO PITCHER $14THANK YOU THANK YOU jjanga oppa for making a spot like this... of course I do love your AYCE sushi as well... but my tummy can only hold so much raw fish ahahhaha Even though this place is a long distance way from where I live... I will be coming to get my fix!Jjanga, known for their sushi, is now running this spot as a Korean resto with karaoke. I have mixed feelings, since I'm not that into Korean but I really liked the sushi spot that was here before- there are a few sashimi and seafood items on the menu now, but it's largely deep fried, stir fried, and soup dishes.OYSTERS: An order of 6 will set you back a low $10, and they're large. I did not care for how they were seasoned with a spicy sauce, but my BF really enjoyed them.LEMON UNI: This is perhaps my new favorite way to eat uni! Generous portion, good price, served several pieces on a halved lemon. Squeeze for more juices and flavor. Would get again!BEEF TATAKI: Decent flavors, it's a simple dish and it's about average here. Not necessarily something I'd order again.GARLIC CHICKEN LETTUCE WRAPS: Well, there was lettuce and chicken. Lettuce was weird small pieces of iceberg that did not easily make wraps, and the chicken was juicy and breaded but lacked flavor. The provided sauce was not garlicky, but more of a peppery paste.SCREAMING ORGASM: Sashimi salad, super saucy. The sauce wasn't flavored quite as I was used to, a bit less acidic. Generous portion, would get again.Service at the bar was friendly, and they kept most of the cool glow-in-the-dark décor from when this spot was Fish in the Spotlight. I'll have to come back for actual Korean dishes, but I'm still mourning the fact that this isn't a sushi spot any more. I'd really prefer if this was still sushi and karaoke, regardless of the name.
Ajbani Moroccan Cuisine=It's somewhere between a 4 and 5. Since I'm sleep deprived and all hopped up on coffee, we'll round up for good measure to a five.I have been so excited to check this place out ever since I saw the reviews start popping up on Yelp. So when my fabulous, globe-trotting, six language speaking friend Dianne texted that she needed to be fed, I knew this was the perfect spot to bring her. A breakdown of our order:Veggie Briouats- I'm not vegetarian, but we went with these as a suggestion from the guy who took our order. He was right, you won't miss the meat with this savory filling. This is an item I will definitely order every time.Kefta Brochettes- delicious meatball-like kabobs. It comes with a harissa yogurt dipping sauce. Rubbed chicken and apricot- this was Dianne's entree. I loved the flavors of this. Definitely a big enough portion to share or divide up to make two meals. Kama veggie tajine- I had my heart set on the hearty veggie with chickpeas, but they were in the process of cooking a new batch and I was too hungry to wait. So, I went this route and ordered it over couscous. This is such a filling dish. I was stuffed less than half way through and enjoyed the leftovers the next day for lunch. I will be back to get the veggie and chickpeas!The couscous is really good by itself. They slow cook large batches daily. It has a a great flavor. Make sure you try it on its own before mixing with your entree. I know my Twitter friend Katie L. is obsessed with the falafel here. I haven't had a chance to try it yet. If you're not sure what to order, don't be afraid to ask questions. They are happy to help. As we were leaving, the guy ran outside to track us down because he found a keychain on the floor and thought we had left it. Super nice. Ajbani is located in the old Second Helping spot next to Three Amigos. It is primarily a take-out place, but they do have a few small tables inside and out. They also have a cooler with some beverages (water, Honest Tea). Kudos to the crew here for bringing an underrepresented cuisine to the Queen City. This is such a great addition to Plaza Midwood and Charlotte.Ajbani.Moroccan food has landed in Charlotte and it's delicious. There's plenty of Couscous for everyone. If you've never tried food from Northern Africa, you're in for a treat!Go with a group of friends, like we did, so you can try a bunch of items!Berber Chicken: roasted chicken with saffron, cinnamon and garlic over couscous.Falafel Sandwich: actually - tender and smaller pieces - not dry at all.Apricot Chicken: great flavor. Dry rubbed chicken served with olives, apricots and veggies. Yes, your chicken was better than mine! Don't rub it in.7 Veggies with Lentils: really nicely balanced vegetable stew with the perfect amount of heat.Keftah Brochettes: Moroccan BBQ style meatball kebabs - a nice meaty char served with Harissa yogurt sauce.Veggie Briouats: little savory Phyllo pies - you won't miss the meat!Tomato and Caper Salad: super summer dish made with a hint of preserved lemon.Eggplant Zaalouk: roasted eggplant dip with garlic and tomato. The owner is very friendly and stays on top of quality control, making sure he's happy with the dishes and their appearance.There are a few tables indoors and out, but you know how that goes in Charlotte. Either  face the brutal heat outdoors, or the hot air wafting over from the kitchen prep area. Take out is probably your best bet during the summer!
China One=It's fast food, so the quality is only going to get you so far, but nonetheless, the service is always great here. Usually if I place an order for delivery, it arrives before the said time frame and the food is hot. I usually get the Mao Po tofu entree and they have yet to disappoint.
Station=Despite consistent Bloomfield efforts to Keep Pittsburgh Shitty, Station enters the neighborhood as the restaurant that no one wants, but everyone needs. As a resident of the area, I'll admit that I wasn't totally sold when I heard about Chef Curtis Gamble's classy casual yuppie hip dining joint injected in the heart of Bloomfield. After only being open for a week, though, the warm hospitality and enthusiastic attitudes of the restaurant are already spreading the great reputation that it deserves.The owners are committed, friendly, and eager to meet their new neighborhood. The service was perfect--not too obtrusive, not too serious, and never neglecting (even in a nearly packed house). The drinks were refreshing, and the food was spectacular.The tagliatelle is handmade using the pasta maker left over from whatever old Italian joint was in the space decades ago. The heirloom tomato salad features fresh dill and an Old Bay mustard. The chicken is perfectly crisped and complemented with bread pudding and grilled lettuce.And the space rules. Relax at the bar with a cocktail, walk in for a nice meal near the bar, or make a reservation in the dining room for a more intimate atmosphere. I hope Station sticks around the area, mostly because it's nice to be able to walk to a fine-dining restaurant for a meal and cocktails without worrying about how I'm going to crawl home.This place is really like nothing Bloomfield has ever seen before, yet they really make you feel comfortable with a casual vibe, just like Bloomfield itself! The bar is beautiful and the drinks are a work of art, thanks to the master behind the bar. If you don't get a cocktail here, you're really missing out. The most inventive one I've seen is the Ruby Queen, beet juice at it's best, spiked! And my favorite so far, the Manhattan. It's really all about the seasonal produce and interesting ingredients to give a dish personality and flavor. The first time I came here I ordered the heirloom total salad, which was every bit as good as I'd hoped it would be, with some playful twists. The golden tomatoes dill and sweet corn mixed brilliantly together. And the fermented cherry tomatoes were such a great and unexpected element of an already awesome salad. For an entree I ordered the crispy chicken breast and leg. I NEVER order chicken in a restaurant because it always ends up dry, but I seriously trust that Chef Curtis will whip up something incredible here. I was not disappointed in the least. It was tender chicken, lightly breaded and not over-coated by any means. The bread portion came in the form of dirty bread pudding with a corn puree that I wanted to lick off my plate.The second time again I ordered the Butter Poached Walleye. Every single item in this dish was drool-worthy. the walleye was excellent, the green beans and fingerling potatoes were a great accent but the saffron dumplings were the icing on this cake (don't even get me started on their popcorn panna cotta...soooo good!!!). I've actually only eaten in the bar area so far. First night was PACKED and admittedly a little too loud (am I old??). But my second time I hesitantly sat in the bar area again and the noise level was totally fine. I could hear everything my friends were saying... unless I was too busy stuffing my face.I can't wait to keep coming back and seeing what rotates on the menu seasonally. I imagine each time will be just as good as the last, if not better! Get ye to Station, stat!We went to station for my birthday a few weeks ago. We were a group of 8 and sat at the high top tables on the bar side of the restaurant. It was a little loud, but not too loud that we couldn't still converse. We would have preferred to be on the dining side where it is quieter, but when you have a large group you take what you can get! My husband and I shared an order of wings as an appetizer and we both agreed that they were the best wings we've ever eaten. EVER! They had so much meat on the bone and were deliciously crispy. The flavor was also out of this world! For dinner, we also both had the Pork Tagliatelle. It was also a winner. It was a rich pork meat sauce with a one hour egg on top of thick ribbons of pasta. I got full and couldn't finish my plate and it was so upsetting because it was delicious and I wanted to keep eating!The service was good, but we could have used some more water by the end of the night. All four of the glass carafes at the table were empty and the waitress never refilled or brought new ones.
Angry Crab Shack=I'm letting all of you know that Angry Crab- Peoria, is now open!They don't do barbecue or pizza like some of their sister restaurants in PHX, Mesa and the Tukee- here it's all about crab, shrimp, crawfish, crab legs, mussels, clams, oysters, po boys, catfish and several other things that swim. Pro tip: dress down because you will get messy. Need to take a shower soon after dining messy. Might wanna drive through a car wash with the windows down messy. But it will be worth it. The staff is very friendly and if you need help tying up your bib, they'll hook you up.It's across from Lee Lee, on Cactus, just west of 75th Ave and at least for now, only open for dinner from 4-10, 11pm on Fri & Sat. The atmosphere and vibe is so unlike anything else in the area, and of course, so is the menu. I've been waiting on the "OPEN" sign in the front window to be turned on for about 4 months. It's a long overdue "interesting" addition to the neighborhood and I'm glad it's finally open!It was a busy friday night! They told us the wait was about 45mins... well 15 mins later, I got a text saying that our table is ready, awesome! Aaron, our server was nice and accommodating. I ordered my usual shrimp trifecta mild and my friend ordered the soft shell crabs with a side of cajun fries. The fried crabs were huge, it comes with a dipping sauce and a side of coleslaw and lots of cajun fries. My trifecta shrimp was very juicy & it's finger licking good.. with lots of lemon juice! From Mesa, to Phoenix, and now here in Peoria.. My experience is always great!
Chile Addiction=My family is originally from New Mexico, so I grew up on stacked enchiladas, sopaipillas and posole. When I heard Chile Addiction had opened in the southwest side of town, I was so excited to give them a try. I was thoroughly impressed by the food and the service. So impressed, that we ended up coming back not once, but two more times.I have tried the stacked enchiladas with pork verde, posole, stuffed enchiladas with pork verde, chile adovado, huevos rancheros, sopaipillas, tamales, breakfast burrito, churros and fried ice cream. Every single thing I have tried has been great and definitely has that nostalgia factor going for it.The service here is beyond wonderful. The servers and owners are so friendly and welcoming and make sure refills are plentiful. They've even offered us free dessert as an apology for our food taking too long. The funny thing is we didn't even notice a delay, but they insisted that we order dessert on them.I plan on making this a regular spot and I hope others take the time to experience this regional cuisine that holds a special place in my heart. Just skip the desserts as they are not good.Family owned with colorful and thoughtful décor- and that's just when you first walk in the door! Service, even for a simple takeout order, was friendly, made menu suggestions, and even tossed in some extra sopapillas. Menu has all of your southwestern favorites, with both red and green chile.The green chili stew was thick and well-spiced, packed with potatoes but only a few bits of pork. Good flavor in this dish, and a good price, which included accompanying tortillas. I also added on a chile relleno (with both red and green sauce) from their a la carte section, but found it soggy and overbattered. The sauces were on point, though. Bring your hankie, because your eyes will be tearing up at the heat.However, I'm not a fan of the gimmicky drug/420 references all over the menu- referring to a breakfast burrito as a blunt, for example? I find it tacky and in poor taste, unless your target audience is high school teenagers. Bonus points for offering a Yelp check-in offer for free dessert with purchase.New Mexico style Mexican food?!? I've never had that, I needs to go to there! And so there I went. Bright-eyed and bushy-tailed declaring this a food adventure. Especially seeing this place so highly rated on Yelp... again, don't believe the hype.This was a major food fail for the most part. First and foremost, it took about 10 minutes for someone to come by and say hi and take our drink order. Chips and salsa arrived shortly after. The salsa was a bit spicy, which I liked, but my dad and sister don't do spicy, so they only had a quick taste before tapping out.I ordered a cup of Pozole. It was delicious, heavy on the hominy (which mama likes), and was presented in a large bowl and tasted homemade. My little sister ordered a carne asada burrito, refried beans, and rice. I had the stacked enchiladas with carne adovada with calabacitas and whole pinto beans. My dad opted for a combo with a beef enchilada, chile rellano, and a carne asada taco. We also got a side of sopapillas which weren't touched. When the order came out, my dad's taco was MIA. The taco appeared like 20 minutes later and we declined it, they offered to let us take it home, and I did with my left overs.So let's talk about the food. It was bland and kind of boring. I was expecting more exciting flavors! New flavors, but everything fell flat. The only stand out dish at dinner was the Chile Rellano. It was the dankest of the dank and probably the best one I've ever had, but a Chile Rellano does not a 5-star review make.Thanks to Yelp, we got a free fried ice cream as we looked over the check. Fried ice cream was great, but it wasn't anything I hadn't had before.Chile Addiction didn't leave me with even a craving or much to remember them by. I really wanted to like this place. I really want little independent places to make it! I really root for the underdog! I just can't give them more than 2stars. Poor service with less than mediocre food. I'm chopping it up to rookie mistakes. Will venture back, but very under-whelmed (that's the opposite of overwhelmed, right?).This has been on my radar for a few weeks and we went here for dinner tonight.  Walking into the restaurant is a treat.  It is so well decorated with New Mexican, Southwestern and chile items that it's very pleasant.We were soon greeted by Amy who showed us to our table and was our server.  After looking over the menu, we ordered a burrito for my wife with refried beans and Spanish rice and I got a chimichanga filled with carne adovada.  My two sides were pinto beans and calabacitas.  I ordered red sauce--regular spice level--for my wife and I got the triple hot green sauce for my chimichanga.  We were brought a basket of chips and some salsa that had a good kick to it.  Even my gringa wife is starting to like spicier foods.  Win!Our dinners came and they were very good.  Andrea thought her red sauce was spicy but she liked it.  My triple hot green sauce was great and it added great flavor to the adovada.  The only minor drawback was we were brought no sopapillas despite the menu saying that all meals are served with sopapillas and two sides.  As it turned out, we were full enough without having the extra amount of food from the sopapillas.For dessert, we got an order of fried ice cream with chocolate drizzle.  Very good and large enough for sharing.Prices are very reasonable and for some reason we had a $4.35 credit applied to our bill listed as a coupon.  We didn't have a coupon.  Our server, Amy, was a verry pleasant person.  She made you feel welcome.I wish the menu offered a bit more choices but I will be back to try the stacked enchiladas."This is gonna hurt me more than it's gonna hurt you."Having grown up in Albuquerque and Santa Fe and having a true love for New Mexican cuisine, as well as knowing how to cook New Mexican cuisine, imagine my absolute delight that someone had decided to open a New Mexican food restaurant in Vegas apart from Carlitos Burritos.  (Which, by the way, is a SMASH hit 5 STAR place.. and the Nevada Governor's fave place to visit when in town, I know, I was there when he said it himself, but I digress...) 1 star for having the "huevos" to open up such a restaurant 2 stars for the beautiful Southwest décor, complete with an RC Gorman print on the wall... Regretfully that is where I will leave it.  Service was miserable.  NOT a crowded afternoon, it was AARP / toddler hour.   Took FOREVER to seat us and there were more than enough open seats.  Once seated, we counted 18 minutes until someone came to our table.  That was after my husband had to flag someone down.  These are the basics, people.  Once we did order it was an eternity to actually get our food.  Carne Adovada was super dry and not worth a third bite.  The pork chile verde was loaded with large potatoes, no hatch green chile spice at all and one piece of pork.  Really?  My husband and I were so disappointed.  I seriously have no words for the level of gross.  Too bad, it would have been a huge hit for my family had it been better.
Flo's=I came here for lunch one day since it's down the street from my work. I ordered the chicken Katsu. Instead of white rice it actually comes with friend rice which I thought was a good twist. The Katsu was good. Remember this isn't Onos or L&L so you're not going to get the best Katsu ever. But it was good. For drinks I got the Mandarin Oriental. Omg! For $9 a drink, you definitely get your money's worth. I actually thought it was a bit too strong. Each sip was like taking a shot each time. I thought their dishes were a bit pricey. We're talking around $12 a plate. It would be nice if they had lunch specials. They have a very big menu so there's definitely a lot of items to try.
Le Pain dans les Voiles=Just an update to say that aside from offering truly exceptionalicious baked goods at truly sweet prices, the staff here are beyond nice and fair. I just saw them load up a customers bag with 9 croissants and charge her for 6 because they were smaller than usual. Myself and everyone in the fast moving line smiled and thought to ourselves, I'll be back. I love it here.
Green Life Cafe=True GritGreen Life Café wants to be all about the Zen experience and fully takes advantage of its cozy setting on Monroe Avenue in the former location of the Macha Tea House.  Unfortunately, they forgot about some basic restaurant tenants such as properly seasoning its food, thoroughly cleaning ingredients so customers don't get a mouthful of grit and periodically checking on its patrons during their dining experience.The restaurant's cool quotient is high with fresh flowers on the tables, a citrus-infused water cooler, and plenty of hip knick-knacks sprinkled though its intimate setting.  The menu is limited, a number of smoothies, coffee drinks, wraps and crepes.  The person behind the counter didn't attempt to engage me as I perused the menu to offer any suggestions.  I elected to go with the $9 falafel breakfast wrap (falafel, scrambled eggs, roasted peppers and eggplant and mushrooms) and paid the $1 up charge to get the freshly made sweet potato fries.  The dish looked spectacular, with the deep orange fries contrasted against the green tortilla wrap with a pale yellow curry yogurt dipping sauce.  However, kitchen failed to put any crunch on the exterior of the falafel.  Both the wrap and the fries were woefully deficient of salt.  The bigger sin was that with every other bite, it felt like I bit into a grain of sand.   Not cool, Green Life, not cool, you've got to do a better job of cleaning your ingredients.  The last disappointment was the post sale service, or more precisely, the utter lack of post-sale service.  The restaurant was not exactly overrun with customers during my visit, so it disappointed me that neither front of house staff member ever checked in to see what I thought of my meal.  There are limited weekday breakfast options in this area, so I really hope that Green Life gets its act together.  While I will probably return at some point (I'm a sucker for a well-prepared savory crepe), I am going to give them a couple of months to get improve food offerings and their customer service.
The Beer Kitchen By Innis & Gunn=Went here yesterday with my brother & our girlfriends. I'll admit, me & him were always going to be easy sells - anything titled "The Beer Kitchen" was always going to be a winner for us, and the fact it was done by our favourite beer, even more so!!The place looks very cool when you go in - bright, open, exposed brick, etc. There's plenty of seating in there too, with the added bonus of not cramming you in like sardines too! We all noticed on the way in, a stool section set up for quick working lunches - very clever!But onto the big bit, the food.... I'm always dubious about steak sandwiches anywhere - you always end up with the thinnest, toughest cuts of steak, and spend most of your time trying to chew through! Not so here - thick, juicy cuts, red in the middle, and full of flavour. Easily the best steak sandwich I've ever had. My brother went for the fish & chips - the batter was very crisp and full of Innis & Gunn flavour! The mushy peas were epic too!! Both the girls went with the chicken burger - which again, looked amazing. We all had food envy, which is a first!Of course, drinks are covered by an extensive choice of their best beers (and a selection of others too). There's also wine, gin... all your usual other bits! I went for their "beer flights" which is essentially a taster of 4 varieties. Soon as it came out, my brothers bottom lip began to pertrude, and so began 10 minutes of "I should have got that..." Being the nice older brother that I am, I let him have a (small) taste of each.I think we have a new contender for my favourite place in Edinburgh!!
Rosallie=It's been that kind of morning.Running errands, getting things done, sleepy from working the night before. As I'm going from place to place, I browse through my Instagram to see a post that a new bakery/cafe was right down the street. I look on Yelp, it looked like they just opened yesterday. No pictures. Hmm. I look back on IG and see one of their Apple Crumble Pie. Whoa. I'm a sucker for crumble anything. Let's go, I said to myself, you need a break.Quaint. Cute bright ambiance. Very much what I'd envision a corner cafe in France. The owner and girl behind the counter greeted as I scoped out their display. I mentioned the Apple Crumble Pie, since I didn't see it. Walnut Pie today instead as he just put out a limited batch for their first week of opening. Whaaat?!?! Bummer.I love their tea display, all the leaves in small batches with a clear cylinder top which the owner said I could open. The cylinder captures the aroma of each batch, it smelled heavenly. I sat down with my Green Tea Passion Fruit and Almond Pie, took some pictures, and just relaxed. The tea was fruity and smoothing, the Almond Pie was light and buttery. I had to restrain and take most of it home. I'm sure they can put together a box of pastries and cup of coffee to go, but this isn't that type of place. It's one where you sit, sip your latte, chit chat with friends, and enjoy. We don't do that enough, or at least I don't. I wish I could give it 5 stars, being I'm FTR. Hopefully, I'll be able to the next time I visit, fingers crossed that they have that Apple Crumble Pie!Sweet little French-inspired coffeeshop facing the street at Rainbow and Patrick! Interior is open and modern, with cute French-country-style décor touches. Bonus points for the bookshelf wall in the back, and I dig how they used room dividers to lend the tables a bit more privacy.Coffee menu has all of your favorite staple drinks, I especially like how they have peppermint mocha available  instead of keeping it a seasonal special- I got it with soy milk. There's also a limited food menu of salads and sandwiches, most under the $10 mark. Props for opening so early (7AM!), and making the food fresh- unfortunately, the service was somewhat standoffish considering I was their only customer. My intention to pick up lunch on my way to work didn't work out, but I will be returning shortly to try one of their salads and hopefully adjust my rating upward . Pastry selection is limited, but they do offer macarons.It's nice to have a little quiet time to yourself on a Sunday morning. And then some guy just has to walk in and quietly look at your baked goods and menus...Such was the scenario for the young lady in the front when I walked in to Rosallie this morning. She's probably new, or else it was too early in the morning, but she didn't really ask me anything while I perused the items. Some might find this standoffish, but I was very happy to take my time in relative silence.On one menu board, they have various warm items served with salads, as well as sandwiches, soups. There are a few more complex plates with bread and/or croissants plus meats, cheeses, and spreads depending on which menu item you choose. On the other board, they list their various coffees and teas, included french press options for both types of liquid caffeine delivery, flavored specialty coffees, and teas that have their leaves displayed in glass containers near the register. There are also croissants, breads, macarons, cookies, and other baked goods on the counter or in a glass display.A friend had made urged me multiple times to go, so I finally obliged and followed some of her specific recommendations. I chose the quiche lorraine ($8.90), which is one of the "salad" items, and a plain croissant ($2.10). The quiche was delicious and really fluffy, with a nice crust and just enough bacon. The salad had fresh mixed lettuce, julienne carrots, and halved grape tomatoes, all dressed in a great portion of vinaigrette. The portion of that dish may only satiate smaller stomachs, which was fine with me since I had other eating to do later on.As for the croissant, I was only going to taste a bit of it but ended up eating almost half. It was so alluring with its flaky crust, fluffy interior, and balanced butter usage. If I can't stop eating something as simple as a "plain" croissant, then they're doing something good. I later found out through small talk that the gentleman who owns the place is indeed originally from France. Leave it to a Frenchman to make a great croissant, right?I also ordered a "large" iced tea ($3.00 for 16 oz), opting for the green tea w/ passion fruit. It had a nice flavor with no bitterness and that hint of passion fruit coming through. I didn't feel the need to add any sweeteners whatsoever, although I would have reached for the small pitcher of honey if I'd been in the mood. Along with the food, it was enough to boost my energy for the morning ahead. I was a little disappointed that the cup seemed to be chock full of ice, and I'll either request less ice next time or wait for cooler weather to try a hot tea. I really like the idea of hot tea from French press as my parents are wont to do.This new cafe at the northeast corner of Rainbow and Patrick is easy to locate. They have "Le French Cafe" lettered on the south side of the building, and it seems to be intentional since the 'L" is stylized the same way as in their main "RosaLlie" logo on the building's west-facing facade. There appears to be ample seating for a small crowd, including traditional tables with slightly cushioned chairs, window counters with hard stools, and some couches and armchairs. I wouldn't mind trying the latter section next time except it seems inappropriate for food. Ordering coffee, grabbing a book, and sitting down to relax would be great. Even the music helps since it's at a low volume, with a mix of softer songs from contemporary artists and Motown.I'll certainly be back to try some of their breads and other baked goods. While I haven't tried that many French bakeries in town, this one seems like it should compare favorably to the best.(QUICK UPDATE 9/9/15: They brought the full complement of owners and employees out for the grand opening. As one of the first 25 people to visit, I got a free coffee voucher valid today only. I opted for a hazelnut praline served hot which was a great not-too-sweet treat to start the day. The mini plain and chocolate croissants were free and may have lost a bit of the magic of the full-size, but I learned in the evening that even a day-old almond croissant is buttery, flaky, and fantastic.My lunch, which I also purchased at regular price, was the Nord sandwich, a smoked salmon treat with my choice of multigrain bread. The bread ratio seems unbalanced at first glance, but the smoked salmon is powerful even in one layer, and the bread would be delicious even unadorned. Final note from today was the complimentary chocolate chip cookie, which was quite delicious, reasonably chewy, and quite buttery. Not actually my favorite chocolate chip cookie in town because the chocolate chips are a little sparse, but it'll hit the spot if anyone has a craving.)Since my last visit, this spot seems to have blossomed. Came for a few afternoon visits and staff were friendly and welcoming. Finally got a chance to sample the food and have fallen in love with the madeleines and sandwiches, particularly the Est (brie cheese, tomato, pesto, and greens, all on a fabulous brioche bun).  I haven't camped out with a mug of tea yet, but as the colder weather settles in, I'm coming by more frequently for grab-and-go coffees, which are always just right. Come by when you have some time to kill and explore all the little seating areas and the owner's decorative touches- there seems to be a story behind everything. Staff is very professional, and Jonathan is great at suggesting items to try.Items Selected:AmericanoDuck Confit on Whole Wheat Petite Tourte with Onion JamMadelineChocolate Almond CroissantWalnut PieApple TartAlmond FeuilletinePetite TourtePraline Buche NoelAlmond CroissantCroissantMacaron - Pistachio, Chocolate, EspressoPalmierDashing down to South Rainbow Boulevard shortly after hearing about Rosallie to find the work of Jonathan Pluvinet shockingly authentic for French pastry in Sin City it was only a matter of time before a return trip was planned to see more of the Niece native's growing variety, a few days exploring Bordeaux recalibrating the palate, but in no way changing opinions that Pluvinet's tarts and viennoiserie would compare favorably to those in his home country.Greeted like a friend by Pluvinet on Saturday, though I had hardly made his acquaintance prior to co-writing an article about the Rosallie in David Magazine, it was with Christmas decorations in full display and festive music overhead that the sizable cafe again extended greetings and with stories exchanged about his skiing background, move to America, and childhood working at his family's restaurant the young chef's knowledge and passion were readily evident, a dedication to his craft seemingly already noticed by locals as a steady stream of traffic sat down to breakfast or opted to take home pastries by the bag.Intelligently expanding his selection slowly, a calculated maneuver in a city where enormous menus of mediocre fare are generally truncated quickly...at least for the restaurants that last more than a few months...the focus at Rosallie remains pastry, sandwiches, and salads plus tea and coffee, the later besting any in France though the sheer quality of the beans while the imported French duck atop fresh baked bread is rendered in-house to a crisp succulence beneath lightly sweeten onion jam.Having already sampled several baked goods, and as such allowing Chef Jonathan to serve whatever he pleased, first bites of a Madeline previously marred by chocolate spoke to far greater flavor and softness this time around while the almond croissant imbued with chocolate was every bit as lovely as butter and almond versions experienced last time, a huge mess still made by shards of the shattering shell.Not one to 'Americanize' the menu, though an elegant 'apple tart' would properly rival all but the most elaborate Tart Tatin overseas, those looking for something rarely seen Stateside are well advised to invest in a slice of Walnut Pie, the bitter nut more common in Europe providing a great bit of balance compared to the more common Pecan version found throughout America that is oftentimes far too sweet.Impressed by the thinness of feuilletines and a Palmier that probably should not be eaten in the car or anywhere with rugs unless a vacuum is nearby it was with several gifts to-go that I bid Adieu to Jonathan and his growing team, the macarons still perfect with the natural pistachio flavor particularly impressive while croissants raise the bar for everyone else in Southern Nevada, as too does the buttercream Buche Noel that comes as a sharable portion in one of three flavors, the cheerfully decorated praline version outshowing 'yule logs' from Manon, Bouchon, and even Jean-Phillipe.***** Finally a place consistently offering croissants on par to those found overseas and really making an effort to grow the business through quality and craftsmanship it should go without saying that Rosallie is a special place that will likely only continue to improve, another in a growing line-up of Off-Strip Chefs that need and deserve their community's love and support.
Chengdu Taste=I almost didn't come here to eat tonight, because I am not into eating really spicy food. But I was visiting my friend's store and mutual friends dropped by for a visit and invited us to try this popular Chinese restaurant from Alhambra, CA. that just opened up in Chinatown.While walking over here, we were even discussing why this particular spot have host quite a few failed restaurants in the past few years, in spite the fact that the restaurant next door always seems to be busy.We arrived right after 5pm, and there was already a crowd standing, presumably waiting for an open table. The restaurant is sparsely decorated, there are Chinese opera masks acting as ornamental points of interests on the otherwise unremarkable interior walls of the establishment.  But I don't think anyone really paid attention them.After glancing through the menu, our party had picked two appetizer portioned items immediately, while debating on which entree items to ordered. In the end we opted for the following:1. Pork with Garlic Sauce 蒜泥白肉89. Wonton with Red Chili Sauce 紅油抄手22. Boiled Fish with Green Pepper Sauce 藤椒魚56. Toothpick Lamb with Cumin 牙籤羊肉The first two items are a must!  I can literally order that and be able to down 2-4 bowls of rice with these Chinese comfort food. The sauce is the secret trump card of nearly divine deliciousness (sadly it is not vegetarian friendly. But that does not affect me.) The pork is sliced thin and cooked by a chef that have obviously perfected the dishes. The wonton is good, but their version of the Red Chili Sauce is superb!!! Major nom nom time as soon as the servers dropped off these two dishes!!!The Toothpick Lamb with Cumin is decent, but it pale in comparison to #1 and #89. The Boiled Fish with Green Pepper Sauce 藤椒魚 is listed as being spicy, but it has a nice flavor and was not overwhelmingly spicy (we asked them to not make it too spicy), and it was a great recommendation from our waiter.Overall, for a place that has probably not been opened for more than a few days in Las Vegas, I can already predict that it will be a major success story. The food is good to "shut up and take my money" good.  Servers are busy with the number of tables they have to wait on, but they did an admirable job of it.Menu price is higher than expected, but with the superior execution of the dish it can easily be justified.  Plus the whole time we dine here, it is clear that the restaurant is packed only with super informed Asians (mainly Chinese) patrons, a major indicator of superiorness. I highly recommend that you all come and check them out, but preferably after I am sick of dining here (after about two month) or after I am already seated at our table and waiting for our food.So keep it on the DL. Only share this wonderful recommendation with your dearest friend or the one you intend to marry. Otherwise everyone will have an hour wait just like the people visiting their Alhambra and Rosemead locations.So hush x4.
Anchor Bar=Chicken wings are one of my "secret" cravings - I'll usually prefer them to other foods they're associated with (aka pizza). A good chicken wing, however, is hard to find as there's not a balance between the chicken and the sauce. It's quite a statement to proclaim that an establishment serves "the original Buffalo Chicken Wing (tm)", and "the best wings in the world". Anchor Bar continues the tradition of East Coast favorite chains first finding their foot on the West Coast (Shake Shack, White Castle). They are located in the Grand Canal Shoppes Food Court inside Venetian|Palazzo. They have limited seating in the actual counter but there's plenty of seating in the food court. When the No1DP and I were there they had samples of their boneless wings.I got the Original Anchor Bar (Buffalo) Wing (medium spicy) with seasoned smoky chipotle fries and a Pepsi ($14.50).- Portion size was big enough for two people. Unlike chicken wings I've eaten that comes as a traditional side for pizza or sold in grocery stores, each chicken wing was a fatty mini drumstick. The No1DP said that had he known the portion size was that big he would've been happy to share my combo.- Anchor Bar is the only business to do a chicken wing right, equal portion of crispy chicken wing skin and sauce. Usually a chicken overwhelmed with sauce is trying to hide the quality of the chicken. Each chicken wing was cooked properly.- Celery sticks were thin but crisp.- The bleu cheese sauce isn't strong and is made to complement the wings, celery sticks and fries.- Fries, though adequately portioned, needed to be more crispy. This is the reason for the -1 star.I had over half my food left so I gave it to two homeless guys camping out in the bridge that connects the Palazzo to the Wynn. They looked like they needed food more than we did.If split between two people it comes to around $7.25/person so I would recommend this as a suitable cheap yet delicious lunch/dinner option in the Strip. They also serve other flavors of bone-in, boneless wings, salads and sandwiches for people who want to make their meals more interesting.
Pints On Penn=You should try Pints on Penn! You haven't tried Pints on Penn because you didn't know it existed but now you do...so try Pints on Penn!They have a nice variety of beer, which is not for me but my eating partner was very satisfied. I thought the beer cocktails were really cool and I would have tried one if I didn't get obsessed with the Watermelon Ginger drink! It had fresh watermelon and ginger beer. It was really great.We order 3 apps that were really good!Brown Sugar Bacon- 5 fat strips of bacon all covered in brown sugar with a mapley cayenne dipping sauce= win!Stuffed zucchini- super fresh veggirs stuffed a home grown zuke. It was topped in cheese snd served with marinara. It was good but I wanted some sausage stuffed in there!Stffed avocados- This was my fav! The avocado was grilled and stuffed with a corn salsa. The ingredients were supper fresh and the chips were homemade. I loved!We didnt get a chance.ro try the entrees. During HH, the apps are $2 off and beer is $1 off!My friend saw this place on Groupon & we knew we had to check it out. Anything with "pints" in the title intrigues me, haha. They also are new- only open a couple months, so we were excited to go. We went on a Monday night- found parking easily on the street & it wasn't very crowded inside. There were 5 of us & we found a spot easily on the second level of the restaurant. Our server was very nice & attentive to us the entire evening. Their draft list was decent in size- I went with a fruity IPA, it was delicious. They had beer cocktails, which was awesome. My friend ordered a beer that came with a smoked jalapeno inside (it was in the drink menu- the drink will be different depending on what porter they have on draft at the time). He loved it.For appetizers we ordered the Spicy Sausage-Stuffed Apple, Spicy Chicken Nachos & Fried Pickle Chips. The Spicy Sausage-Stuffed Apple was our favorite. It was everything fall in a delicious appetizer. It wasn't too spicy but it was very flavorful & delicious. The Spicy Chicken Nachos were also a hit- they weren't super spicy but they were delicious. The fresh avocado on top was the perfect addition to the chips, chicken & cheese sauce with Pico. On their own, the chips were a little too salty, but overall we really liked this appetizer. The Fried Pickle Chips really weren't anything special. They were good- but not really memorable. My boyfriend & I weren't too crazy about the Guinness mustard that came with them- we enjoyed dipping them in ranch instead. Monday night is wing night- so three of us ordered some wings. For 50 cents each we couldn't pass up the chance to try some of their wing flavors! We ordered: 5 spicy dry rub, 5 hot pepper jam & 5 of the special that evening (honey spicy BBQ I believe?). The dry rub were good- definitely tasty. The hot pepper jam wings were a little disappointing. The jam didn't stick to the wings & therefore they were a little tasteless. They also weren't spicy at all- they were really sweet. The flavor that was on special that evening were the BEST. Super good.For our sandwiches, our group ordered: the stuffed meatball burger, the city chicken sandwich, two grilled southwest chicken wraps and the roasted turkey club with house bacon.My friend who ordered the stuff meatball burger LOVED it. Mozzarella cheese was literally dripping from the burger- it looked Awesome. I had the opportunity to try the city chicken sandwich (PORK for anyone who doesn't know what city chicken is)- it was definitely really yummy. It was also huge and my friend couldn't finish it. The two peeps that ordered the grilled southwest chicken wraps seemed to enjoy them as well. But I have to say that I ordered the best sandwich... the roasted turkey club with house candied bacon was IN-sane. It was HUGE. Thick slices of real turkey breast, thick slices of house candied delicious bacon LOADED high. This thing was a building basically. The flavor did not disappoint at all either. I was only able to eat 1/3 of it that evening. My boyfriend & I ended up splitting the remainder of the sandwich into two sandwiches & had that for dinner two days later.. so this one sandwich literally was 3 meals.. it's that big. One bummer about the sandwiches is that they all come with fries- they don't have other sides available. My friend did ask to switch her fries out for a salad- which was a $2 upcharge (not bad). The fries weren't super good- we ended up eating some for leftovers but then just throwing the rest out.Overall this place was awesome- I would really like to return for the turkey club in the future, as well as a cold beer to go with it.Check this place out asap!
Kingbertos Mexican Food=Not Very GoodThe staff at Kingbertos Mexican Food are warm, friendly, and extremely accommodating, which is why I feel terrible for calling out their Mexican food as bland. I really wanted to like Kingbertos  so badly, especially after reading so many positive reviews. However, the food in my opinion just isn't good.This was my first visit to Kingbertos Mexican Food Restaurant, and for me the food  just isn't good. On this visit  I choose the shredded beef taco, tostada, Refried Beans, and Mexican Rice, both of which had very little taste.  In fact the refried bean almost had a somewhat grey appearance, and the shredded beef was very greasy.  The meal was just very disappointing.Kingbertos isn't the worst but I'm not in a rush to visit again
Smokin' Crawfish=Move over KFC! This is the new "finger licking good"! This is the place to be when I want to get down and dirty!Smokin Crawfish is the newbie on the block. Their signature spices just made my palette crave for more of their "Smokin Style" seasoning which contains all of their spices in one A-M-A-Z-I-N-G flavor! The right touch of sweetness, garlic, and spices makes this the "WOW" factor for me! The "Garlic Butter" is another must try! Don't let the name fool you! It's unlike any other garlic butter! This place definitely has the edge over other competitors for me. The friendly atmosphere and great food surely made a lasting impression! It's across the plaza from Hot and Juicy Crawfish in the intersection of Decatur and Spring Mountain.Smokin' Crawfish, You've earned my 5 stars!I thought the reviews were too good to be true but it lived up to its expectations! It's almost like boiling crab but the sauce is slightly different and the menu has more items here. It wasn't busy at all on a Sunday lunch and I honestly hope it's doesn't get busy like boiling crab. They have combos here to choose from and it's pretty reasonably priced. My boyfriend and I decided to do al la crate because I can literally eat 3 lbs of crawfish to myself and the combo didn't let you pick two of the same seafood. I ordered 3 lbs of crawfish and a Dungeness! We got the level spicy and It's honestly not THAT spicy if you can take heat. Im going to get smokin next time. The crawfish was pretty good frozen and they cooked my boyfriends crab perfect! When you cracked the shell, the meat still kept its shape! The sauce is really rich and buttery too! It's less oily than boiling crab which is a plus for me. Oh and the side of rice is pretty big. So I suggest you share it between two people. We also ordered calamari and it was okay. It was a little too salty for me and the meat was little. Other than that, I love this place! A great new addition to Vegas.Glad to have another crawfish boil spot in town! Location is in an awkward corner of a plaza, but interior is nicely decorated with a seaside theme- I like their entryway, and their lobster-claw-catch game. Plus they have beer and sake, as well as a few TVs to watch a game while you're there.We had a pound each of shrimp and crawfish, with potatoes, sausage, and corn, in their Smokin' Sauce (a combination of all of their seasonings), at medium heat. Their heat scale is a bit more relaxed than other places, but the flavors were good. Crawfish and shrimp were nicely sized, but I really liked their fried softshell crab basket the most- perfectly cooked, nicely crisp and seasoned crab, over a generous bed of Cajun fries, for $12. Huge dinner for two, total with tax under $50.TIP: they offer 10% off during their grand opening with Yelp check in- but only Mon-Wed, between noon and 4PM, so pop in for a weekday lunch if you want to save a few bucks, but their pricing is fair compared to other spots in town.I eat crawfish & crab at least 3 times a week and this place is by far the best. The crawfish for $8 a pound is beyond a good deal. They were of good quality & the 4 flavors were very good. I was actually surprised the food was so good. We also had soft shell crab, oysters, catfish & crab legs. Beer selection was good also.Our waitress was a new trainee, but i couldnt tell. She was very friendly, eager & knowledgeable. She checked on us often. Hopefully she remembers us when we go back.
Base Pizzeria=I try to wait at least a month before trying a new restaurant so that their kinks can be worked out. After reading all of the great reviews I decided to take a chance on Base Pizzeria, and I'm very glad that I did! My husband and I came here for dinner last night and were instantly welcomed by the owner as we walked through the door. The owners were so friendly, engaging and nice! They're very passionate about their business and it shows. The menu consists of mostly pizza, salad, a few appetizers and they have a variety of wine, bottled beer and spirits from Arizona Distilling Company. Everything they have is organic and locally sourced. I always love being able to support local!We chose the crispy proscuitto salad and the El Diablo pizza with a Pinot Noir for me and a Kellerweiss for my husband. I had ordered the Pinot Noir on the menu board, but was also given a taste of a bottle which they already had open. I ended up liking the tasting better than the one I had ordered, and will keep that in mind for next time. It was great that they had offered it to me so I could discover something new. The salad and pizza arrived quickly and both were fresh and wonderfully flavored. The proscuitto on the salad was crisped to perfection almost like a super thin bacon, all of the veggies were fresh and the strawberry balsamic vinaigrette had just the right bite. The El Diablo pizza had a slightly sweet hand crushed tomato sauce, which was very light and tasted of perfectly ripened tomatoes. The sopressata was delicate on spice, just enough to not overpower any of the other flavors. High quality Kalamata olives and roasted peppers made for a well-rounded dish. I would not hesitate to order either of these again.In a neighborhood with tons of pizza options available you would think that they would have some stiff competition. With the high quality organic ingredients that they're using, incredibly welcoming service and delicious food, Base Pizzeria is a step above the rest. I have no worries that they'll be successful and I can't wait to try the rest of the menu. Props to them for putting together such a well-oiled machine in such a short amount of time.
Fuku Burger=I must admit, I was excited for Fukuburger to open in my favorite part of town. Having been to their truck at First Friday and waiting over two hours for a burger, I no longer had to stand awkwardly in a crowd of hippies and deal with the ridiculous wait. ATMOSPHERESuper hip with loud ratchet music LOL Vibe resembled a lot like the atmosphere of First Friday. The artwork displayed here were definitely the highlight. Four LED displays above the counter featured their menu as well as some cool videos. SERVICENot much to say about this department. I tipped them anyways and everyone yelled "Tip Jelly!" , then gave me a jelly. You also get to choose your funny nickname just like how it's done at the truck. Don't ask what mine was. FOODThis is where I questioned myself whether to give three or four stars. I ordered the Buta Burger which is my usual order at Fukuburger. Juicy, mouth-watering beef patty with bacon, cheese, onions and red ginger. I did enjoy my burger. However, for a burger that is as small as my fist (and I have a small hand), its $7.99 price tag is not cute. I remember paying $5 at the truck and it was the same exact portion. Please do keep in mind, I have been to Bachi Burger and have no problem paying $12-26 for a burger because given the quality and portion, the price is justifiable. If you are going to charge $8, at least give bigger portion than the truck. Burger is good, just not worth $8 for such a tiny burger. In addition, $2.10 for a small drink. Am I at Disneyland? CONCLUSIONCome here for the atmosphere and amazing burger but prepare to pay around $10 and leave hungry.Fuku has been a local food truck favorite- and I've enjoyed their food. One of the perks to their new brick in mortar location (besides being convenient to me!) is that their food quality is consistent and their service has improved. The location also offers free wifi, as well as fun music and videos playing for entertainment while you wait.While their Buta Burger is still my favorite- always juicy, plenty of flavor!- the Naga dog is also a solid option. However, a flaw I've noticed with both is the bread. The burger buns are bulk-purchase and don't stand out, and tend to fall apart. I'd prefer a sturdier version (maybe an onion bun?), the King's Hawaiian buns would be a really great option, especially for the hotdog.I'm a little disappointed to see that the pricing is still a bit high- $8 for a burger is fair, adding $5 for a drink and fries is steep, and $9 for the (admittedly generously-sized) Naga dog is higher than several local specialty hotdog spots price theirs. I guess I expect slightly inflated pricing for food trucks, but to see the same prices here as at their Strip location was unexpected.
Pawn Donut and Coffee=Items Selected:Pumpkin CheesecakeThe KingRaised and GlazedApple FritterCrodoughHoley Moley! Donut Holes (Red Velvet and Classic)Located in the recently opened Pawn Plaza, a sort-off "Container Park" concept on South Las Vegas Boulevard near to the Shop that spawned the Show that launched the musical (that bombed) and countless other concepts comprising the Brand, it was midday Friday that a stop was made at Pawn Donut and Coffee, and with friendly attendants offering contests and coupons in the free lot a quick perusal of other eateries showed a number of familiar faces, a familiarity that actually spills over to both the fried carbohydrates and coffee roasted by Illy.Admitting a bit of predilection to the pastry our country has always defined as a breakfast treat but only  recently rediscovered as something worthy of more artistry and attention to detail, it does not take more than a quick perusal of the PD&C website to realize the work is eerily similar to Pink Box or Donut Mania, the later actually producing the goods at owner Ralph Cautela's request as he feels their donuts are the best in The Valley.Not particularly wowed by my lone visit to Donut Mania, the pastries themselves good enough but off-put by the owner accosting me at the door for simply snapping an exterior photo before explaining himself and telling his story, suffice it to say that options are a bit more limited at the Pawn Plaza outlet while the nod definitely goes their way for smiling service and outdoor seating, though certainly not for  pricing.Acknowledging the address + fame-based up-sell, though still not thrilled to spend nearly $15 for six selections ranging from $1.50 Classics to $3 for 5 Donut Holes and a $2.50 Special, it was with each item bagged individually that way was made to the patio for indulgence, first bites of the cake-style red velvet a bit light in cocoa while the white version tasted like a top-tier old fashioned with great texture to the dough.Onward to the brioche style of yeasted donuts made popular at Pink Box, though supposedly developed by Wayne at Donut Mania, a Raised and Glazed ring next proved pillowy and delicious while the layers of lamination beneath a sugary lacquer placed the much improved alt-named hybrid on par with ACE on Tropicana or Press at The Four Seasons amongst the best textured in the country.Unfortunately finding the seasonal filled donut to be far too much cream cheese and not enough spice or pumpkin puree, it was in two more successful selections that the not-so-modest snack concluded, the fritter well constructed with lots of apples and crispy edges in the soft-centered East Coast style while The King somehow managed to balance what must have been nearly a quarter cup of peanut butter with bruleed banana and plenty of crispy bacon stuck to a dark chocolate layer on top.***Having now visited every independent doughnuttery in Las Vegas and Henderson, the results ranging from dreadful KD's to world class ACE, Pawn Donut and Coffee is a good choice for tourists and those who happen to be in the area, though locals would be better served to experience the goods from their South Durango source where each is freshy made and a quarter or two cheaper, as well.Located at the new Pawn Plaza, this coffee and donut spot is TINY! Required city signage on the wall states the maximum occupancy is THREE. Grab and go or at least take your goods outside to the provided seating. Don't forget your wallet on the counter, which will probably be empty after the prices here...Shop offers a case of fresh-made donuts in traditional flavors (sprinkle, chocolate cake, glazed), seasonal options and specialties (such as an Elvis-themed chocolate-PB-banana option, maple-bacon bars, cronuts), as well as "holey moley!" donut holes, and apple fritters- the latter of which seems to be a hit, seeing as how the three men ahead of me in line ordered them in quick succession, rendering me unable to sample them myself.Opted for a cronut, which had great texture, though unevenly-applied glaze flaked off like dandruff all over the table rather than inside each bite. I did enjoy the light sweetness. Sprinkled donut ($1.50) was very average, did not seem the freshest despite my 10AM arrival, less than 3 hours after opening. There were two flavors of donut holes available (5/$3): the chocolate was dry and flat sans any glaze (arguably the best part!), but the red velvet was nicely glazed and seemed the freshest of my sampled items, though light on the chocolate flavors.Service was friendly- my soy latte was made quickly and correctly, and they had no problem accommodating my last-minute check-in offer (2 free donut holes). Don't forget to redeem yours!
Avenue Club and the Bubble Up Bar=Edit: entrees are not "mostly above" $25. I still think they are overpriced but I must have exaggerated it to myself when I first wrote this. Whoops! I liked Avenue Bar and I like Avenue Club. To me they are entirely different and my fondness for the old restaurant doesn't detract from my enjoyment of the new one. That would be comparing apples to oranges.Ambiance is modern and festive. Would be a good spot for a celebration.Food is very good. The mussels were good and in a delicious broth. I only wish we had more bread or there was more in the broth besides mussels because I ended up trying to drink the remnants up like soup. I also enjoyed the confit chicken wings and the apple, date and bleu cheese salad.The drink menu has a lot of intriguing choices and the shrub cocktail was great. I thought the Rouge 74 (75?) was fine, but I expected a little more. Definitely want to return to try more cocktails.Service was fine. A little slow at a few points but not so bad for 8pm on a Saturday night/a new restaurant working out the kinks.My biggest complaint would be the price of the entrees. I am excited to return to try more of the shareable plates, sandwiches and salads, but I likely will never order an entree. Many are $25+. Why do all of these relatively casual restaurants in Madison, WI suddenly think they're fancy restaurants in New York City?!Brunch review + a general commentary on the interior/remodel/refresh.+ Sunday morning brunch cannot be beat - so, so solid+ Fantastic bartenders - very helpful, friendly and responsive+ Excellent bloody mary; I like mine on the spicier side, and they are happy to oblige. Housemade tomato mix is perfect consistency - not too thin, not too heavy, and very flavorful. A bit light on the "salad" (side) items, but the housemade pickles more than make-up for any other wants+ Great brunch menu that offers a little something for everyone+ Mushroom omelet was *nearly* perfect. The eggs: fluffy, light, cooked perfectly. The filing of mushrooms, onions, and chives was perfectly cooked, but lacked seasoning, and was just a tad too oily/buttery. Back-off on the fats and bump-up the salt/pepper a tad, and this would very easily be Madison's best omelet, hands down.+ Pulled Pork & Sweet Potato Hash was *outstanding*. Featured some truly divine pulled pork (moist, smoky, perfectly rubbed) with a nice sweet potato hash. Pickled onions provided just enough bite, and the two over-medium eggs that I had on top were expertly cooked (mostly set, with just a hint of runny yolk). Truly loved this.+ Sides of greens were excellent as well - fresh, bright, and nicely balanced- Coffee left a little to be desired, but was serviceableAll-in-all, this was one of my top 5 all-time best brunch experiences. I *will* return many, many more times. The bartender, the food, the drinks - all were really outstanding.Regarding the refresh of the interior: I dig the updated look and feel. It's modern while remaining true to its roots. For those who long for the old worn-out booths, dirty ceiling tiles, and tired carpet... find another dive bar/club. The Avenue did a great job of renewing itself and providing some much-needed love to some really critical areas. The new bar is fantastic, the seating is comfy, and the booths/tables pay homage to times of old and honoring the spirit of the old Avenue. I'm a fan. I don't miss the old stuff one little bit.
COO Rouge=We had a late, light dinner here tonight.  It was recommended by our B&B host and is an easy block and a half walk.  The building is old and the décor is charming and eclectic.  The room you enter has the bar and it's noisier than the room to the left.  We were greeted warmly and given our choice of tables.  We chose the quieter room.  Tables are covered w/ butcher paper.  There's a bilingual menu and the table d'hôte is on a blackboard.  Many things looked good, but we weren't hungry enough for anything major.  Alan chose the smoked salmon entrée (entrée here is an appetizer at home).  Our hostess was concerned that it wouldn't be enough for him.  I chose a four cheese sandwich w/ tomato and pesto.  It was heated but not grilled as a panini is.  It came w/ a choice of fries or salad and I chose the latter.  Both salad and sandwich were tasty.  Alan was pleased w/ his salmon.  He had bites of the salad and of the sandwich, so we both had enough food because I wasn't as hungry as he was.  We both had water to drink.  Service was friendly and accommodating and the food hit the spot.  3.51, rounded up.
Eklectic Pie=I stopped in a few weeks ago and ordered a half loaded potato skin and a half meaty Italiano minus olives pizza ($7.99), and had a San Tan Oktoberfest ($4.39) to wash it all down.  Right away I was greeted by the employees and I really like the interior.  They did a nice job.  It's funky and interesting.  They have a fantastic selection of local brews and wine to choose from as well, and the pizza combinations on the wall of fame are very creative.  I saw several I want to try.  Of course you can also build your own.The potato skin pizza had intrigued me when I looked at their menu online, and living up to its name, it does taste like potato skins which goes GREAT with the beer.  The meaty Italiano half was very good as well, with lots of good quality meats.  I just didn't care for the crust.  It's a nice thickness, but totally bland.  I read the other reviews and the owner's comment about why they use the conveyor ovens.  That makes sense.  I just miss some kind of garlicky or buttery or seasoned flavor in the crust if it's not going to have that brick oven flavor and char.  Thankfully the toppings are all excellent and kind of overcompensate for the crust.  I enjoyed my first visit and my husband really enjoyed the leftovers.  I will definitely be back.
Abyssinia Restaurant and Cafe=I went in today w/ my brother. My brother and I had the vegan plate, no meat, no dairy, no animal byproducts whatsoever. It was exactly what I wanted. The plate was big and it was perfect for two people the share. The bread is called teff that's has been in Ethiopia for over 3,00 years (the server informed us). He also informed us that it was high in fiber and iron. I also did some research and found that it was very high in protein as well. I love that they have vegan options, that they use olive oil, and that the customer service was excellent. Also, for the gluten-free lifestyle, they can certainly accommodate toC starting w/ teff.The veggie combo I got here has the unfortunate distinction of being both the skimpiest and the priciest I've ever been served, and I've ordered them in 11 cities and four time zones. My first thought when it was served was, "Wait ... is that an appetizer?" My plate came with the requisite lentils and cabbage, as well as pureed potatoes in place of the customary solid ones. The two problems with the servings: their size, given that the plate they were served on was largely injera, and a lack of variety. I'd been hoping for greens and yellow split peas, which commonly come with vegetarian combos along with salad greens. I was tempted to order kitfo -- raw beef -- to fill out my plate but took comfort in the fact that at least my bill likely would be small. Surely, a veggie combo that's half the size of some I've been served elsewhere would be half the price, right? Quite the contrary; my bill was more than $14 for about $7 worth of food.The restaurant's atmosphere is a saving grace; it's bright and inviting. There's free Wi-Fi; you just have to ask an employee for the password. And while I've had to work to get employees' attention at some other Ethiopian restaurants, that wasn't the case here. People were quite friendly. Based on some other reviewers' pics, perhaps visiting here as part of a group results in getting more food and better variety. But if your solo experience is anything like mine was, the results will be underwhelming for both your palate and your pocketbook.
The Smashed Pig Gastropub=Sometimes, you don't need a picture to support a review of a business that's really good. Or at least that's my story after another phone battery outage during a restaurant visit...(Sorry about that. I did get some photos courtesy of a friend who finally made time for lunch during a return visit to Vegas, I was originally going to introduce him to a certain new sushi burrito place but our mutual local buddy said that we should try this new place downtown called The Smashed Pig. I can be a bit of a sucker for brand-new places these days, so I agreed.)(Oh, and that sushi note? Interestingly, Nobu Matsuhisa-trained chefs Linda Rodriguez and Martin Swift formerly ran a Red Rock Resort restaurant called Hachi, no relation to the new Hachi on Jones near Spring Mountain. That explains some of the Japanese influence in a simple one-page food menu otherwise easily mistaken for that of a British pub.)This self-proclaimed gastropub opened a couple weeks ago in a former tattoo parlor, which is just a hop, skip, and a jump away from Las Vegas Blvd. Interestingly, they're only open 2-11pm on the weekends right now. As I recall, the bartender/server mentioned that morning traffic has been slow on the weekends in this cold season. That all said, we were fortunate to arrive after opening, and we seated ourselves at the bar after being told that the restaurant section would be unavailable until the server's scheduled start time at around 4.I could go on and on about the comfortable atmosphere and the bartender's menu knowledge and friendliness, but let's get to the food already.French Bean Tempura ($7): wholly ordered off the bartender's recommendation. She called it "crack," and I can't disagree. It's pretty straightforward tempura with chipotle mayo and toasted almond slivers, but I could hardly stop eating it. I'd get it next time in a heartbeat.Lamb "Tacos" ($9): not the most beautiful colors ever seen in a dish, but a nice spice profile somewhere in the vicinity of the Middle East or India, some serviceable sour cream, an sweet pepper chutney that's addictive on its own, and a crispy eggplant that substitutes for a hard shell. Overall, another fantastic appetizer. I considered ordering a second helping, but I wanted to try other items instead.Crispy Deviled Eggs ($8): served with cornichons (tart, mildly sweet pickle) and dusted w/ paprika. Lacked the oomph of the other two appetizers, especially in the hard boiled white. It's good, but not exceptional.(I skipped the $3-a-piece oysters based on the bartender's description of their small/medium size,  verified by my observation, and they weren't particularly impressive per my friend.)The Smashed Pig Burger ($14): seems like all beef to me, ironically. Ordered medium and without cheddar (+$1) per my visiting friend. It's served with sea salt garlic fries, which may be a tad underseasoned and not so potent in garlic but are otherwise perfectly textured (you know, the whole crispy/fluffy thing) and go well with either ketchup or the burger sauce (a mixture of ketchup, mayo, sriracha, and a sauce whose name escaped the 'tender but may be the "HP" brown sauce). This sauce really helps out the burger too, which is not great until the sauce is added.Fish and Chips ($16): two large cod fillets with tartar, hot mushy peas (not joking, almost burned my fingers), and malt vinegar. I have had much less experience with fish and chips than I'd like, but even if this dish isn't done the proper way, it's done the right way. You can't go wrong with really moist fish inside a crispy batter, and all the condiments work, including the very palatable peas. Oh, and the same fries from earlier serve as the chips here. Maybe a little pricey, but I was happy enough even if my wallet wasn't.Sticky Toffee Pudding ($5): this was somehow at least as wonderful as the toffee pudding that I recently tried at the now-closed David Clawson Restaurant. This moist, delicious cake topped with whipped cream and a caramel sauce that's less viscous that anticipated is, dare I suggest it, destination-worthy. It was certainly a worthy end to a marvelous mealWhile the gastropub experience might be considered incomplete without particular beverages, I abstained from alcohol due to DD duties. I will note that my friends seemed to enjoy the canned craft beers, such as the Back Home gingerbread stout. Maybe I'll try it next time, or I could pick a beer pairing specific to each menu item.With a disclaimer that I haven't visited nearly all of the other Downtown Las Vegas restaurants, I currently can't recommend another nearby restaurant over The Smashed Pig. I'd say that Carson Kitchen (NOTE: based on an old visit) isn't as good, and Park on Fremont across the street should just shut down now and save themselves the agonizing death. Whether you want a full meal or a quick bite, you should definitely stop here the next time you're in DTLV. Better yet, make this the focal point of your visit."This is a poor man's Carson Kitchen," my boyfriend groused, as he paid our $40 bill for four great-sounding apps that failed to wow us. I expedited my visit here based on a friend's recent rave review (Chris V), and ordered several similar dishes, only to find most options underseasoned with a better version merely on the other side of the block.FRENCH GREEN BEANS: Tempura beans with spicy mayo and toasted almonds. I like the cooking method and these were solid, and admirably light on grease. But the nearby CK has a larger portion with a great dipping sauce that this version can't hold a candle to.TODAY'S SASHIMI/TARTARE (TUNA POKE): This was just okay. Poke was oddly seasoned with large chunks of onion and a lot of spice, rather than the citrus-garlic-ponzu punch I'd been anticipating. It was really fresh though.LAMB TACOS: The dish I was most anticipating, with a clever concept of crafting a taco shell from fried eggplant. I really enjoyed the sweet pepper chutney, which was reminiscent of a ratatouille. But the lamb itself lacked the familiar, meaty flavor. Seemed to lack any sort of seasoning whatsoever.CRISPY DEVILED EGGS: A fried egg white with nicely fried crispy texture, topped with a bland but creamy egg yolk filling, and entirely too much paprika. I had anticipated a version similar to a Thai hard-boiled egg, yielding a barely-cooked yolk. This just didn't work for me. Other that the paprika, there wasn't much going on... and for $8/4 pieces, CK's version with caviar is the better option.I was dying to try their sticky toffee pudding, but my BF refused to order anything else and experience additional frustration. Around this time, our server disappeared for a solid 20 minutes and eventually the super-sweet food runner settled our bill for us. This spot has great decor and the menu all sounds like food I'd love, but the execution and/or consistency are just not there at this time- perhaps Chris and I had different chefs working on our visits? I'm too hopeful not to give them another try sooner or later, but right now I'm underwhelmed.
TC Tacos=I really hope this place stays around for a long time.I was hungry for dinner and i clicked on my Yelp app and this place had great reviews and had what i wanted, which at the moment was tacos!The really unique thing about this place is that all the meats are cooked in a smoker which adds an added layer of flavor to your typical taco meat. I asked for the 3 taco special which included rice and beans.  I had smoked chicken, smoked pork and smoked beef.  they were all pretty good!The salsa bar is one of things you need to try. The salsa that stands out is an orange colored salsa that has some bite, and tastes like nothing I've had before.I'ts good, you need to get some. . The other salsas were also very good and I'll have to go back and try some different ones. They have a good selection of meat, pretty much anything you want and many items on the menu that I have yet to check out, Overall this is a great spot with people that care about the food they make. I'll be back for more
SK Seafood Restaurant=I know, it's a seafood restaurant and I didn't order seafood- what was I thinking?!  I personally dislike how "market price" is listed for nearly every dish in the category, but found a bunch of other tasty items to try. Dishes are made quick and served family-style.HOUSE SOUP: Gratis with meal, on the plain side, mostly broth with hints of ginger. Much appreciated to warm us up on our 40-degree evening.SCALLION PANCAKES: Four-piece order, delicate and light with a nicely crisp exterior. These complemented our heartier entrees nicely.LAMB AND LEEK: So good! Plenty of leeks and green onion, generous and tender portion of lamb, definitely something I would get again! "EGGPLANT WITH GROUND PORK": I assume there was a miscommunication because my dish had eggplant but no pork, but it was still good. Soft chunks of eggplant, a rich dark sauce, bits of ginger and red pepper everywhere. HOUSE DESSERT: Black sticky rice, date, and red bean soup, allegedly good for circulation, balanced flavor but not to my BF's liking. Service was shockingly good- I'm used to receiving the bare minimum at most places on Spring Mountain, but here we were checked up on regularly by several staff members. Pricing was reasonable, the above was just over $30 with tip. I will be coming back to try the seafood items or clay pot dishes.
Norske Nook Restaurant & Bakery=I checked out the Nook during a friends and family soft opening. I visited the location in Osseo many years ago, and it's great to have one just around the corner in De Fo--although my waistline will beg to differ! The interior is very welcoming, with homey, slightly kitschy Norwegian decor. More impressive is what greets you right when you walk in the door: the carb-o-licious behemoth that is the bakery case. There are some kinks yet to iron out--really not worth mentioning at this juncture because that IS the purpose of a soft opening. As for the food: it took quite some time for my party to settle on what they wanted, with much flipping from front to back of then menu, and then back again. The Ruben sandwich on pumpernickel was filled with flavorful corned beef, and the bread was excellent. I have to admit that I ordered the Lefse wrap with Swedish meatballs and mashed potatoes because I hadn't tried anything like it before, and it tickled a wild hair. Now that I have had that experience, I likely would not repeat it. It wasn't bad; just really not my thing, as it turned out. The burgers and other sandwiches looked great, so maybe I'll take the less exotic route next time. We capped off our meal with a slice of pie, which was a rich, decadent little piece of heaven. Overall, I have positive feelings about this place and will be interested to see how it develops after the official opening.
Jaburritos=This place is going to be the next Robertos of sushi! I've seen this concept done in SF and LA but they have a unique twist by incorporating a few subtle Mexican flavors.  Most of the other places have been pretty much just Japanese flavors.  I'm always a fan of fresh ingredients that I can pick up on the go.  Definitely healthier options than your normal fast food or burrito options.  Pretty much all the basic sushi roll ingredients you can think of(salmon, tuna, shrimp tempura, egg, crab salad)...I would like to see them put eel into the mix as well in the future. And for the non seafood eaters, they have chicken and steak. I like that they have tons of fresh veggies you can add and seaweed salad.  The tortilla chip option also gives it a nice crunch to the rolls.  They also have chips, I wish they had a wonton chip nachos with a mix of fishes/crab, eel sauce, etc.  Lol....if the owner is reading this...I've been dreaming of a place that would serve nachos like the ones at Samurai Burrito in Fountain Valley, CA ;). They were quite the money maker there...I have no doubt it would be similar in Vegas.  They have a plethora of interesting unique sauces to pair with all the rolls.  They also have a thicker house made soy perfect for topping the burritos, as well as the normal pico de gallo, salsas, wasabi and ginger. Quick service, large burritos, reasonable prices!  This is truly fast food sushi heaven.SUSHI BURRITOS IN VEGAS UGH YES FINALLY.I may have gotten a little too hyped for this place, which means my expectations were a little bit higher than usual... The staff was friendly, but I had to wait 25-30 minutes until I could finally order. I kept in mind that there were new hires who were working the assembly line, so it was understandable.Redondo - 3/5 // $12.95The first thought that came into my mind as they were making my sushi burrito was "that's all the rice they put on it? Really?" I thought there'd be at least a little bit more rice to make up for the lightness of the fish and toppings. The quality of the fish was pretty good considering the fact that we don't live by the coast. All the other toppings felt like they were a little bit skimped on and there was supposed to be Chipotle Mayo sauce, but I barely tasted any in mine. Overall, there was't really much flavor to it and it didn't really fill me up, which was a little disappointing (and I have a small stomach tbh). My friend told me that I could have gotten sauces on the side, which is what I should've done! Next time, next time...Other than the food, the atmosphere is refreshing with its white, open space. I got my order to-go, so I didn't really get to bask in the restaurant. When coming here, keep in mind that there may be a line... because there will probably be a few first timers who will take forever choosing which toppings to put on their sushi burrito.I'll have to try the taro chips and maybe one of the juices next time, but I probably won't be going back any time soon since I won't be dying to have another sushi burrito again.First time trying sushi burrito and I wasn't too impressed. Having been raised in Japan, I grew up eating something similar but under a different name. It is called temakizushi (手巻き寿司), a Japanese customized hand-roll. In my opinion, sushi burrito is just more creative name for a customized hand-roll. SERVICETheir "assembly line" was disorganized and inefficient. I understand they just opened last week but I saw one guy grabbing something over another guy's arm. Then a new hire looking through recipe getting in the way of another guy. They should take some notes from Subway and learn to run the line smoothly. 3 people in front of me and I waited over 20 mins to order. Meh.FOODI ordered Mission ($8.95) which comes with salmon, sushi ebi, cream cheese, pico de gallo, tortilla strips, romaine lettuce, yuzu guacamole and tomatillo shiso sauce. Took out the pico de gallo since I can't handle any heat. There's definitely some texture, but it had absolutely no flavor. Tortilla strips gave some nice crunch and I liked how they are generous with salmon and ebi. However, even with their yuzu guacamole and tomatillo shiso sauce, a quick dip in soy sauce was necessary. Odd that I only tasted yuzu guacamole on one half of my sushi burrito. Put more sauce please. You can totally customize your own in bowl, burrito or nachos. Choose your toppings, protein and sauces. Will try this next time.CONCLUSIONI paid around $10 (tax and tip included) for a burrito that wasn't filling. Maybe I would've enjoyed my experience more if I didn't wait for so long. I will give another chance in the future but 3 stars for now.Sushi roll, burrito-style.This fusion concept has made it's way from the Bay Area down to SoCal, across the desert to Vegas! The hardest decision: do you want a burrito, bowl (think poke-style/rice bowl) or nachos (aka Jachos)? I was on my way to McCarren so I went with a burrito as the most logical vessel for a grab-and-go situation.You are able to either pick one of Jaburritos' own creations (named after different seaside locations) or customize your own sushi burrito.  Burritos come wrapped up in either traditional nori (seaweed), flour tortilla, or for carb conscious folks there's soy paper!I opted for a custom burrito. Why? Because I've got old lady eyes and I could simply not be bothered with squinting to read the menu board and messing up my RBF in the process, plus you can't beat ordering your food Chipotle-style.Need help? The friendly staff can help come up with a tasty concoction without judging you for adding all those extra proteins, extra toppings, extra sauces, etc. because beach club season is over now.But let's be real here.... I wouldn't really call this a burrito, it's more of an oversized temaki-style sushi. All in all, I enjoyed my experience here and Jaburritos will be one of the options for food when I'm back in the area and need a quick bite to eat. The sushi burritos were pretty filling (I only added one extra protein serving this time) and the ingredients were all fresh, backed by a reasonable price.  We spent about $25.50 before tip for 2 burritos, 2 drinks and a side order of taro chips with cheese.Pro-tip: opt for the taro chips as your side, or base for the Jachos vs boring tortilla chips.Went on Saturday 10-17-15 around 4:30 PM with my new yelp friend Jamie P.  This restaurant is located in a small shopping center on Sahara just west of the 15.  David's Bridal, McDonalds, and Landry's are in the same area.  The line is set up kinda like Subway...you pick whether you want nachos, a burrito, a bowl, or a salad, and then you can choose between their signature burritos or build your own.  I got the redondo which is Ahi Tuna, Salmon, Yellowtail, Cucumber, Tobiko, Guacamole, Red Onion, Tortilla Strips, Jalapeno, Cream Cheese, Lettuce, Avocado, Cilantro, Wasabi Mayo, with Soy Paper ($11.84 after tax).They have an awesome machine that rolls the rice onto the nori/soy paper.  A sushi machine! Never seen one before.  Fancy-schmancy.  Honestly, I don't even know how to review this place because...well...I don't like sushi.  THERE.  I SAID IT.  I've tried, really.   I want to like it so bad because it's to beautiful and hip!     Like Manami S. noted, the assembly line was chaotic, with the guys reaching over each other and reading the recipes off a piece of paper.  The same guy asked me twice about somebody else's burrito, then the cashier tried to charge me for the person behind me.  My burrito was missing the cream cheese and the onion.  Mildly irritating but understandable in their first few weeks of opening. The place was crowded and there's only seating for maybe 20 people so we took our burritos over to McDonalds and ate them.  I got about five bites in before I gave up and gave my other half to my new friend.  If I ever go back, I'll stick to the white girl options like the waikiki (chicken) or the boardwalk(steak).Hot and new, Jaburritos lived up to the hype on our first visit for dinner last night.  I created my own Jachos with taro chips, ebi shrimp, crab, guacamole, pico de gallo, and had the nacho cheese on the side.  Wow, those taro chips are amazeballs!  I could have eaten another serving and plan to very soon.The b/f created his own Jaburrito with salmon, ahi, brown rice, and chips and was also tempted to get another creation, but the line became super long as we were eating our first go-round.  Word is definitely out on this place.Sometimes new spots disappoint because those expectations become unreasonably high, but Jaburritos did not; we'll definitely be back sooner than later.*TIPS:Our party of six arrived around 6:15pm on Tuesday night and we were lucky enough to snag a table for all of us.  However, it wasn't too long before the place got packed.  It's new, so patience is key.  Check out the menu online so you have an idea of what you'd like to create or try one of their own Jaburritos.It's an American sized sushi roll.Jaburritos isn't a new idea; it's just new to Vegas. There are a few locations on the Western side of the U.S. that serve this style of enormous sushi roll. Yes, this is sushi and not a burrito, but "Jaburritos" sounds better than, "Large Sized Sushi Roll Eatery", moving on... The ordering style is the "create your own" model, but they also have pre-made options to choose from for the creatively drained. This was me when I walked in, and after a brief explanation of the menu I ended up going with the Long Beach Roll; spicy tuna, shrimp tempura, surimi crab, romaine, cucumber, tortilla strips, guacamole, chipotle mayo, Anguilla sauce and a side order of Taro chips and nacho cheese. This crazy ass meal was actually very good and very filling. All the ingredients were extremely fresh, fried additions weren't overly fried, the veggies were crunchy and weirdly enough the house made salsas fit-in perfectly with the other flavors. I did have a problem with the nacho cheese on my Taro chips; it definitely came from a can. Jaburritos can be a bit pricey depending what you order, but no more than any other decent lunch place in Vegas. I would definitely come back and see what else I can jamburrito into my face.The crew that opened SOHO now has this place: sushi, in burritos, with mexican influences. I dig it! Sushi burritos on their own aren't new, the Jogasaki truck from LA rolls into town whenever we have food festivals and Sushirrito is a hit in SF, but I'm glad to see we finally have an option here- especially from a place that does it fresh, fast, and friendly.Walk up and order, Chipotle-style. Customize your creation in a wrap (soy paper, seaweed, or tortilla) or bowl, with raw fish or simply chicken/beef options. Tortilla or taro chips, edamame, and mochi are also options.The ROCKPORT is my favorite so far- soft shell crab, spicy tuna, surimi crab, jalapeno, tobiko, cucumer, red onion, chipotle mayo, and sweet anguilla sauce. Every ingredient harmonizes, would maybe add avocado or guac but it's pretty perfect as-is.The MISSION (salmon, sushi ebi, cream cheese, pico de gallo, tortilla strips, romaine, yuzu guac, and tomatillo shiso sauce) channels some south-of-the-border flavor but seemed to be missing something- maybe add a spicy element like sriracha or jalapenos to perk it up a bit.The REDONDO was runner up- packed with ingredients I love but somehow not the explosion of flavors my tastebuds had anticipated.TARO CHIPS: rather heavily seasoned with furikake (and some other stuff?), these were sweeter than expected and served with a cup of toxic-orange gas-station nacho cheese. The sweet-savory combination oddly worked, but I can't say I'd get it again. Service is super friendly. Vibe is crazy-positive. They're still in their soft-opening phase and busy as hell. This location is way more convenient to me than SOHO, so I'll probably pop by pretty often. Average price per signature 'rrito is ~$11, and they are filling. NOTE: The prices posted on the walk-up menu are a buck or two less than on their takeout menu. Is it foolish to be crossing my fingers that they don't go up?When I saw the culinary mind behind Soho in the house, my expectations grew higher. They were exceeded.I've anticipated the opening of Jaburritos ever since I heard that Chef John Chien Lee of Soho Japanese Restaurant was launching a new place. I finally got to try it when I met up with friends for an early lunch. And yes, the man himself was present, watching the front line and working around the back counter and the kitchen while still smiling to customers. How could that not be a great omen?Jaburritos is his take on the fusion of sushi and burritos. Unlike other concepts that I've tried (local AYCE joint JJANGA and LA-based food truck Jogasaki, the latter a regular sight at the twice-yearly Foodie Fest), Jaburritos actually incorporates Mexican ingredients into the burritos and provides a basic "salsa" bar to boot (mild salsa, salsa verde, and salsa roja in addition to ginger, wasabi, and house soy sauce).I like the location and the space. It's on Sahara across from Palace Station, so it's not far from the freeway. The inside is bright and welcoming with environmentally conscious decisions (full-on LED lights, anyone?) and relatively modest seating (maybe 30 people max). The line moves quickly, and it's very natural to compare the ordering experience to Chipotle because of the assembly line format, the "burrito" bowl option, the possibility of customization (although the pre-designed, beach-named menu items seem like winners), and of course the (sometimes) bagged chips available at the cashier.I decided not to look into the possibility of "jachos" (corn or taro chips topped with sushi ingredients) and I didn't feel up to making a burrito from scratch, so I went for the easy preset options. For the choices available with these, I asked for the soy paper, not the nori wrap, so as to match the presentation of the aforementioned sushi burrito purveyors. I also stuck to the white sushi rice instead of the brown rice because they stated that the latter didn't have the sushi vinegar.Taro chips with queso ($2.99 for the side order, i.e. not the combo): I must mention this first. I kept munching on this and almost ignoring the burritos because they're so addictive. The taro chips are much like the Terra packaged version except dusted with furikake. They're fun on their own, but something about the combination of the taro chips with that liquid cheese dip that makes it very tough to stop. I somehow tasted a light sweetness with the combo, and it definitely wasn't from the queso alone. Definitely make this a part of your order, whether it's the shareable-size side portion or a smaller portion in the drink combination.Rockport ($10.95): soft shell crab, spicy tuna, surimi, jalapeño, masago, cucumber, red onion, tempura crunch, chipotle mayo, sweet anguilla (eel) sauce. It's easy to point to the two powerful sauces as the reason that this has been a winner with others, but it wouldn't succeed without the other ingredients combining harmoniously. The tempura crunch is the standout of the non-sauce components. I could probably eat this all day, but I shared half with a friend in exchange for...Redondo ($10.95): ahi, salmon, yellowtail, cucumber, masago, red onion, tortilla strips, jalapeño, cilantro, wasabi mayo. It wasn't as purely fun as the Rockport, but it's almost as delicious. The fish stand out in this burrito, proving that you don't need so many sauces to have a good sushi roll. Or a good Jaburrito, one that I'd also order again.[UPDATE 11/3/15: Went again with different friends, tried the Kodiak ($8.95): grilled salmon, romaine, cream cheese, pico de gallo, tempura crunch, mango teriyaki, chipotle mayo, and furikake. It wasn't very good, and I had to keep adding flavor from soy sauce and the various salsas. Skip this, and design your own grilled salmon combo if you must.]I tried the salsas with everything. I didn't find that they significantly elevated anything (except for the lackluster Kodiak), but they weren't incompatible and provided a fun accent. The soy sauce helped the Redondo more than the sauce-laden Rockport. I skipped the ginger and wasabi since I feared unnecessarily sharp flavors, but they looked like standard fare at least.Jaburritos is a great choice for lunch or a light dinner. With fresh ingredients and solid execution, Chef Lee has proven the concept of sushi and Mexican fusion while creating the best rendition of the sushi burrito that I've had thus far. I can't wait to return to try different options and eventually make my own Jaburrito from scratch.Big ol' sushi rolls the size of your face? Yes, please. I came in during their first week and I opted for the select your own option. I chose salmon, soft shell crab, cucumber, yuzu guacamole and tobiko. The staff was new and just learning, but patience was key and they were really trying to learn.They let you try any of the sauces and add anything on the side if you prefer. I was impressed by how friendly and accommodating everyone was and I look forward to giving them another try soon. If only they were closer to home.We've got to learn to Reduce, Reuse, Recycle...Are they huge sushi rolls or somewhat small burritos?...yes, they're Jaburritos!!! What you're getting at Jaburritos is fresh, clean food you can customize to your liking. Chef John realized the good thing going on in other places like San Francisco and teamed up a sustainably minded partner to bring Vegas their first glimpse of sushi burritos...think over-stuffed sushi rolls, or hand rolls.Jaburritos is an easy win for me. Price, quality, and flavor. For about the same price as a lot of sushi rolls in town you can purchase a sushi burrito...not Philadelphia and California roll prices, but a comparable value for anyone that regularly orders sushi rolls....and JSB's are larger. You won't find some of the high-end cuts of fish that Soho and other sushi places have, but then again you wouldn't want to "waste" those cuts in a roll or a sushi burrito. What you will find is fresh, good quality fish and meat to make your sushi burrito enjoyable. One of the secrets to a great sushi burrito is the sauce. JSB might even do this better than some other sushi burrito spots. As with most sushi rolls, the sauce is where the flavor is. JSB has a lot of great Japanese sauces, salsas, salsa fusion sauces and even some Asian sauces that aren't necessarily Japanese in nature. Ex: Yuzu Guacamole?...Yes please! I would recommend Jaburritos to friends based on these reasons alone. Throw in the customization of your sushi burrito and the fact that JSB is immensely sustainable in their efforts and I find myself with a business I can really get behind!On your first visit feel free to jump right in to the create-your-own game if you have some ideas to explore before you arrive, however most would do well to check out one of their pre-determined concepts such as:Redondo - ahi tuna, salmon, yellow tail, cucumber, masago, red onion, tortilla strips, jalapeno, cilantro, wasabi mayoLong Beach - spicy tuna, shrimp tempura, surimi crab, romaine lettuce, cucumber, tortilla strips, guacamole, chipotle mayo, sweet anguilla sauceMission - salmon, sushi ebi shrimp, cream cheese, pico de gallo, tortilla strips, romaine lettuce, yuzu guacamole, tomatillo shiso sauceRockport - soft shell crab, spicy tuna, surimi crab, jalapeno, masago, cucumber, red onion, tempura crunch, chipotle mayo, sweet anguilla sauceTL;DRPricey, decent, good texture, long beach. Sushi? Love. Burritos? Love.Pick and choose style eateries? Love. Jaburritos? :(Having eaten Jaburritos 3 times now I can't say I'm a fan no matter what the hype says. It isn't terrible, its pretty decent, but so many aspects makes it a place that I wouldn't eat regularly. It isn't exactly mind blowing, and really more so a giant hand roll that isn't so giant. Smaller appetite patrons may be satisfied after one sushi burrito, but larger appetite patrons may consider getting 2, which ends up costly. Consider quickly though because the lines are tremendously slow and as the place gets busier it'll only take longer. I have been in line for at most 20 minutes, which isn't bad for a sit down, but for a pick and choose restaurant its rather slow. Lunch breakers consider ordering ahead of time.The Long Beach may be the best of the ones I've tried.The sauces are great here (my favorite is queso, weird eh?) but mask most of the flavors of the fish which seems counter intuitive if you're here to eat fish.                There is good texture though, with creamy and crunchy being most prominent. The salsa cups are paper cups but a larger variation is needed for dine in (there is 2 separate cups for dine in and take out), too small to be useful for chips. There is a variety of prices for each burrito ($6-12) but seems to be a bit expensive for the size.ATTENTION: Jaburritos is not closed, per se. They just did a name change to SOHO SushiBurrito. They're still located in the exact same location, same employees and management team. They claim they are still using the same ingredients and such but I can't comment on that since I haven't tried it for myself. Expect a new review on their SOHO SushiBurrito Yelp review page shortly.No more waiting for the Foodie Fest to be here so I can get my Jokasaki fix. We now have JABURRITOS here in town!In a nutshell, it's sushi in burrito form. Please take a moment and take a look at the many pics already posted here. It taste just as good as it looks...if not better.Our first time here, our eyes were bigger than our stomachs. We wanted to try everything to our hearts content. You can choose between soy or seaweed paper for your burritos.I ordered the Rosarito $5.25: spicy tuna, cucumbers, cabbage, tortilla chips, rice and their diablo sauce. Whooo!!!!! Just a word of caution: I LOVEEEEEE anything spicy but that diablo sauce made my lips burn. Yes, it was more of the spicier foods I've eaten in a while.....but it felt sooooo good! ;)Boyfriend ordered the Rockport $10.95: soft shell crab, spicy tuna, cucumbers, rice, tempura and chipotle mayo. He LOVED IT!!! This seemed like the more popular burrito because while waiting in line, two separate people in front of us AND one in the back of us ordered this.Then as if that wasn't enough for us, we also ordered the Long Beach: spicy tuna, shrimp tempura, crab, romaine lettuce, cucumber, tortilla strips, guacamole, chipotle mayo, sweet anguilla sauce $10.95. We split that one. This was just as delcious but we rather stick with our first choice.Only downside is the seating arrangements. Very few chairs and tables. If you come during peak hours, hope you can find a seat. No doubt this place is going to do really well so they need to sort this out somehow...someway.This is like the Chipotle of sushi rolls. You pick what form you want: rice bowl or sushi burrito. Pick a wrapper: soy paper or nori. Pick your rice: white rice or brown rice. Pick a sushi burrito concoction or create your own. Pick your sides: taro chips or edamame. Do you want extra protein? Pay extra. They also have tofu as a protein source.I tried the Kodiak with brown rice and fresh salmon. This normally has grilled salmon so, the fresh salmon was extra. The fish quality was good.The create-your-own option is neat. The combinations you can make...oh, the possibilities!The restaurant is tiny with only a few tables. I'd recommend taking your food to-go because of the lack of seating and you'll end up smelling like cooking oil. The service is great though. The price per sushi burrito is about $9. You can get tiny sushi rolls/maki from other restaurants for about $8 but a sushi burrito is roughly 2-3 times bigger than a maki.
Rivea=Items Selected:Grissini with TapenadeMarinated Seabream, CitrusFocaccia di ReccoBaguette, Semolina Loaf, Olive Focaccia with Olive OilSage/Parmesan Cheese Potato GnocchiJohn Dory baked like on the RivieraCreamy PolentaRoasted Duck Breast, Turnips, Bigarade SauceDouble Espresso on IceLimoncello BabaCappucino Cup with Chocolate BriocheOur Traditional ZuccottoShortbread Nutella SandwichesRarely worried about rebranding, or even ripping a concept apart in order to completely reinvent a space, it was 7:30 Saturday night when I ascended the Delano's glass elevator to meet another local physician for dinner at Rivea, the recently opened Alain Ducasse still bearing some semblance to the former Michelin-starred MiX while the connected Skyfall Lounge is far more welcoming than it once was, though still quite underpopulated despite the dramatic views.Imported from Saint-Tropez and London, Rivea arrives in Las Vegas as a swanky small-plates concept not dissimilar to Bellagio's offensively priced Lago and although the offerings here trend somewhat more French than Italian the menu feels a bit precious, the appetizers mostly trumping $10 for less than two mouthfuls while more substantial mains hover around forty dollars each.Still dripping bubbles of glass from its center, but now turned breezy with seaside blues befitting the Mediterranean cuisine crafted by Chef Bruno Riou, it was at tiny window-side two-top that the two of us were sat despite a dining room less than 10% full and although service was a bit overbearing at first it did not take long before the jeans-and-suspenders with Chuck Taylor's-clad staff adapted to answer questions without overselling, though a few fumbles such as empty glasses and misdelivered plates did subsequently occur.Still a stunning space with high ceilings helping to dissipate noise while 180-degree views of the city remain unparalleled for a fine-dining establishment on the Strip, it was in conversation about restaurants moreso than business that time was passed and with two rounds of bread service each proving well crafted while the anchovy infused tapenade was boldly briny and addictive it was not long before a duo of appetizers arrived, the $14 crudo a bit spendy for such a tiny portion, no matter how "fresh," while the creamy cheese and cracker flatbread was a total disappointment when compared to versions at Chicago's Davanti Enoteca or Mario Batali's chi SPACCA.Citing influences from "the food markets of Provence and Italy," but trending more Central France with a delicious duck whose skin met toasted meringue to double down on crispiness while sweetness played off turnips and a savory brown sauce, those looking for lighter flavors would be well advised to order the $42 John Dory whose flesh comes across delicate yet moist and buttery, a sizable side of polenta smooth and creamy while the potato gnocchi are almost buoyant in their aromatic levity.Outed somewhere along the way from appetizers to entrees as two people more than a little familiar with Las Vegas' dining scene, it was only after our server informed us that the signature Zuccotto could not be prepared in a smaller portion that the large cake-for-four nonetheless arrived tableside compliments of the Chef and having additionally ordered both the Limoncello-soaked Baba and the espresso-infused panna-cotta atop granita the only real question was order of indulgence, for my money the citrusy take on a Ducasse Classic almost as good as the Monte Carlo original while the slowly melting brandy semifreddo certainly warranted gathering a group to enjoy it with.*** Open for only a few weeks and still lacking for both patrons and a cost proportionate to the portions or quality of preparation of several plates it will be interesting to see how Las Vegas responds to yet another rebranded celebrity chef import, particularly in a largely unadvertised space that previously shuttered despite a similar name above the door and some of the most excellent views on The Strip.
Las Tarascas Michoacanas Mexican Restaurant=You know?..there are plenty Mexican restaurants in town, but every now and then you you run into one that totally stands out from all the others and lucky for me this is the case with Las Tarascas Michoacanas. The food is amazingly good! The place is nice and clean with minimal decorations and although it lacks some more Mexican colors, the arches on the wall are a nice touch giving it a feel of authenticity. Service was great, this is a family owned restaurant and they really make you feel like you are part of it. They constantly check on you to refill your beverages and to make sure you're enjoying your meal to the fullest.I ordered the gallina Zamorana, thats chicken covered with a special strawberry sauce and mushrooms, something I never had before and it was delicious, specially with the freshly handmade tortillas. We also tried the enchiladas Doña Andrea and we loved them but let me warn you, this are authentic Mexican enchiladas and not the ones most people are accustomed to here on the states, so if you're a "green grow", I recommend you try the regular enchiladas.We really had a great time here at Las Tarascascas, ask for Viri (I think that was her name) she will definitely take good care of you! I can't wait to come back and try other items on the menu that sounded delicious, the only bad part is that I live so far from this place, but as my friend would say..... I usually don't hang around on this side of town but when I do I eat at Las Tarascas Michoacanas.....don't stay hungry my friends..try them!#great food#awesome service#super margaritas
Morcilla=Another welcome addition to the restaurant scene in the Burgh.  Cool place.  Nice to have some Spanish cuisine.  There are mostly highlights but a few minor things that I am sure will evolve since only open a week or so. We stopped in for a drink and some small plates. The bar is a stand up bar and limits orders from the menus of small plates, just what we wanted to try.  Morcilla cures meats in house so we decided to give them a try.  There is a small case of the many of the menu items on display at the end of bar.  The bar staff was good and friendly.  It was nice to be able to talk with the staff while they mixed sangria and some interesting drinks. We tasted a few of the wines available as a 2 oz. pour.  Not real familiar with some of the Spanish wines, so asked the bar staff for some info on a couple of the wines.  While they were helpful, I think a little more info/description would be helpful.  One was compared to a french wine but did not get a real description.  I would think this will change over time, but a little more of a description would be helpful. One of the wines tasted was probably open overnight and seemed to be a little oxidized but was drinkable.  The others were quite good. We had a couple of the Montaditos (sandwiches), the  Matrimony was terrific, the beef tartare was good but it probably had just a little to much aiolo, The Cecina of cured dried beef  and the Morcilla sausage were both excellent.  The menu includes some Jamon and seafood that we did not get to try, but will definitely come back to sample.  Will have to stop in with more time and have a dinner, too,
Pinches Tacos=This is the second location for Pinches in Las Vegas and is completely different from the one in the downtown Container Park.  It's at the Gramercy just off the 215 at Russell Road.When you enter, you place your order at a "food truck" window.  You're given your drink there unless you're getting soda from one of the many flavors Coke machines.  You're given a table marker and you have a seat while they make your order and then bring it to your table.There was no one there at 5 PM on this Saturday night and I was able to take in the decor and get some photos of the interior.  It was designed nicely with whimsical wall paintings, faux garbage cans that have paper flowers in the top, and a kitchen in glass with wooden closures like a Mexican food place.One of the owners took my order and he chatted with me about the decor and explained the Dia de los Muertos style art done of member of the Anaya family.My meal came--a combo plate with chicken mole taco, adobada taco, and carnitas taco.  I also ordered a Mexican corn.  I asked if they'd hold off on bringing the corn until I could enjoy my tacos.  When I was done with the tacos, I was asked if I was ready for my corn and it was brought to me warm.  This was so much better than getting everything at once and having the corn cool off while eating the rest.  I also got a horchata.The tacos were good with the chicken mole being my favorite.  I thought the other two were OK. The rice was standard and the chips and refried beans were OK, too.  The corn would have been better if it had more chili powder but I'm sure they use what the average customer would like rather than what I prefer.Service was great and the friendliness of the staff was exceptional!If I were rating the place solely on atmosphere, it would be 5 stars all the way.  The interior design was well planned and it's a very inviting place.  I need to come back and try some other tacos and ask for more chili on my corn.  It's easy getting here from where I live.For those uncertain, exit the 215 at Russell Road and head west.  Halfway from the 215 to Fort Apache, there's a left turn into the Gramercy complex.  Drive a semi-circular path around the back of the building along Russell.  Just keep going past the coffee house.  Shortly after an open space, there's another building and Pinches is in the corner of that building.  You can see the 215 and the signs from the parking area.  On leaving keep going around the semi-circle and you'll be back to Russell very quickly.
Frasher's Smokehouse=Looking forward to trying it again in about a month. Hoping they can make some changes before I go back. When we got there (about 6:45pm) they had run out of bbq, except for chicken. So I had me some chicken. I give the chicken 5 stars; it was absolutely delicious, and priced fairly (1/2 lb for $8. So, they have at least one main dish right. The rest of my experience was lack-luster. Here's what went wrong: ISSUES:~ staff unorganized. This is not the fault of the staff; this is a management issue. Why open a place if it's not organized?~ they ran out of bbq! I know it's cheaper to run out than it is to make a little extra, but it isn't very nice for the customer to only have one option~ side dishes were good (green chili mac-n-cheese, and coleslaw), but severely overpriced. Those two sides cost us $6 and the portions were really small. Suggestion: if you are going to have small side dishes, just include it with the main course instead of jabbing everyone for every morsel on their plate.~the bar didn't have basic liquors; just knock off brands. Also, what's a bbq place without beer on tap?~ when we placed our order at the counter the process was not organized. ~ pet peeve: hate it when I stand in line to order and the receipt I am supposed to sign has a line for a tip. I like to have my food served before I issue a tip. Isn't the reward supposed to come after the service? I'm going to give this place another go in a month or so. If they can make a few corrections it could go from below average to great. In my opinion there's a-lot of work needed to achieve that goal. I want it to work. We need a great bbq place in these parts. Need a lesson on how? Go have a meal at Little Miss BBQ in South Phoenix. People stand in line there for the privilege of having great BBQ because it's that darned good.
Snooze an Am Eatery=I dont understand what the hype is all about. We waited an hour Saturday around 10:30am. It was packed. We sat outside (after waiting for an hour outside) in the sun. Its too hot to have tables outside in the sun with no misters. We were able to sit half way in the shade after a while, but still didnt help with the heat. Service was mediocre, ran out of water a few times and had to flag people down for re-fills, ordered the omelette..... nothing but grease. Hash browns had no taste to them at all....... just really not worth the hype or the wait. I think its just busy because its a newer place in old town Gilbert. Dont let it fool you, honestly if you are going to wait an hour, it should be worth it!I would like to preface with the fact that I have really never left a bad review as bad as the one I'm about to give. I worked in the food industry and I get the whole being short staffed super busy on a Sunday morning thing, I really truly do. However...Snooze is Over-hyped, understaffed, unappreciative of its customers. This "80's themed" breakfast joint seemed like a perfect hip place to have a family breakfast this morning, and especially so for my sister's last meal with us before she moved out of state. Boy, were we fooled! Upon our arrival I had my two year old son, my sister and her boyfriend, my parents, and my grandmother. We def anticipated a 45 minute wait so when we approached the hostess stand we were very content at being quoted 45 minutes. Not too bad for downtown Gilbert on Sunday morning. 65 MINUTES LATER I had to approach the hostess stand and ask how much longer of a wait we were going to have. "You have three more large groups ahead of you, so maybe 10-15 minutes." (70/75 minute wait total) This was after my whole family sat outside sweating our asses off. Here's a hint Snooze Owner, we live in Arizona, not sure if you've either A. EVER been here, or B. Lived through an Arizona summer, but it's pretty standard to have misters, fans, SOMETHING. It's great that you offer water and hot coffee but let's be real, ICED coffee would have been more satisfying to your customers, and COLD water, not pipe temperature luke warm water that really doesn't cool your internal temp down. Now, I do understand that there is availability to stand inside but it's so packed in the lobby area (which isn't a lobby) that you can't really stand comfortably, especially with a two year old and about 40 other hot, sweaty bodies. Finally the hostess is ready to seat us, oh and let me say that I had approached the stand about three times after our given wait time and the hostess taking names never remembered who I was. It's called "surprise and delight" to which this woman did not. Hire suggestion, find someone who's younger and mature enough to put a little pep into their voice. I mean really Snooze? You're a multi-location breakfast joint. Breakfast is the pivotal moment in everyone's morning and from the look and sound of almost all the customers around me you ruined that for a lot of people today.Upon being seated we sit at a table closer to the door so we have feel a breeze because we were seated outside where there were again NO fans or misters. After everyone sits down and begins to settle at the table some other, either hostess or kitchen staff member comes over to the table and tells us this table is for another party and we need to move over to the other table. It would have been one thing if she had asked us kindly, but she was pretty rude about it and didn't apologize. So, my family gets up and moves over to a table sitting in the sun. The waitress who ends up coming over to serve us is THE ONLY ONE who apologized, showed any enthusiasm, and was kind. She helped us move the table more into the shade and grabbed a high chair for us. If it wasn't for her I'd be giving a one star review. She was prompt about getting our order in and very understanding that we were starving and sweaty. It took her a bit of time to bring us ice water (she even brought a kids cup for my son) but she came to the table and explained she wanted to ensure a timely delivery of our food. May I also say that this waitress had been outside serving people all morning long who have also been cranky and irritated at their entire experience thus far and she truly upheld the moral part of running a restaurant. Serving good food to good people. For the price the food costs I expected better. The food was good no less, but it wasn't any better than the Good Egg down the street who has a shorter wait, happier staff, and indoor only seating during the summer. I ordered my son french toast which had good flavor and syrup, but the bread was a little dry and lacked a little in texture. The hashbrowns were great. They came very close to beating Beth's Cafe in Seattle WA, which has been a 5 year mission of mine. My dad ordered a simple eggs benedict sandwich which did not have a good portion of hollandaise sauce and fell short. Everyone else seemed fairly happy with their food and as was I. However, like I said it did not live up to the hype or my expectations (which were not set high at any point), not just because the service (minus our waitress) was the worst ever, but because Snooze has expanded too quick & too soon. The recipes should be revisited and refocused. The interiors were fun & simple, however like I've said; it's Arizona don't have outdoor seating during the summer, it's a different story when the high is 80 degrees. Overall, there is significant room for improvement. Owner of Gilbert Snooze, if you would like more feedback, I'm more than happy to give some so you can create a more positive experience for everyone.Zero stars.....We got there at 7:00AM to beat the rush. There was no wait time and we got seated instantly. That's where the good ends, we sat there for 10 minutes never got water or even a server to let us know they would be right with us. It wasn't busy and didn't seemed under staffed, the reason I say that is there were plenty of servers just huddled around talking and making eye contact with us. So five minutes later we just walked out. The couple right next to us were flustered too and were commenting on the bad service. I now know why there is always long lines at this place. I thought it might have been the food but I guess I'll never know.I enjoyed two cups of coffee and the front lobby ambience here this morning, for an hour, as I waited for my table and watched people who came in before me get seated...before me.  (We'd requested a table for two, at the first available spot: inside, outside, at the bar....didn't care.)We kept checking our text messages as we thought maybe we'd missed our text alert that our table was ready.  Nope, we hadn't missed anything.  Yet people were walking in and being taken right back because their party, by blind luck, happened to fit the correct size requirements for the table that was currently available.  I know I wasn't alone in my anger and confusion over why people who came in after me were being seated after me because I watched a steady stream of other waiting patrons walk up to check on what was going on with their table too.  This seating arrangement seems grossly unfair.Did I mention that I did this for an hour before I finally got mad and left?  And the kicker?  When we finally told them to cancel our table and that we were leaving BOOM a table for 2 was suddenly available!I was at the Snooze in downtown Denver two weeks ago where I enjoyed amazing food, stellar service and our party was seated in 15 minutes flat, with none of this seating stupidity. Get your shit together, Snooze-Gilbert.  Honestly...
The Cellar At Duckworth's=I just landed a new job (thank you, thank you!) and the lady wanted to take me out for a nice celebratory dinner. I'll preface this review with a tl;dr at the beginning: It's gonna be hard for me to top this place as far as dining experiences go.You walk down the staircase, and suddenly, everything changes from sports bar to swanky '20s speakeasy, complete with bowtie'd hosts and hostesses, jazz noir music (provided by their very own pandora station), dim lights, and mason jar lined tables with dark tones. This is legit, man. The only thing that The Cellar shares in common with upstairs? The owner and the use of Ipads for drinks. Even the general manager is separate.The Drinks:The Cellar prides themselves on providing rare beers, and they sure do excel. In fact, I hadn't heard of a single one of them on their menu. They have a good variety of aged stouts, porters, belgians, farmhouse ales, even some wine type drinks. We didn't even delve into the cocktail menu. The staff is super knowledgeable about the beers as well, citing their flavor profiles and prominent flavors. FYI, since these are so rare, you're only gonna get 5 to 9 ounce pours on most. Sip and enjoy, this is NOT the place to be slamming nattys with the guys.The food:Food is served tapas style with dishes coming right to your table when they're done cooking. I could honestly write paragraphs describing the handcrafted details and complexity and deliciousness of this food, but I'll keep it short:3 Cheese/Meat Plate ($15) : We chose the Sopraseta, Aged Gouda, and a cheese I had never heard of called a Challerhocker (literally translates to 'sitting in the cellar'), all paired with different dips and preserves, as well as spent-grain bread from Birdsong. Amazing.Tuna Tartare ($12) : Beautifully prepared with crispy noodles, an awesome guac, and crispy wontons to eat it all up with. Incredibly well seasoned and tasty.Truffle Mac N Cheese ($12) : Both the Lady and I tasted it and said "...wut." It's not food, it's just bliss. Heavy on the truffle, but little bits of prosciutto add the needed saltiness throughout the dish. Perfectly cooked and fantastically flavored.Scallops ($19) : Jesus. How can they make food that good? Paired with a cauliflower puree and a salsa of roasted corn and currants for sweetness, this dish was out of this world! Service: Our server, Gabby, was absolutely delightful. She stayed with us to talk us through the intricacies of each dish, and was very attentive the entire night. Made us feel very welcome. Thanks, Gabby. The manager came up and introduced himself to make sure everything was going alright. At the end of the night, I spotted the actual beer bottle cellar and he took the Lady and I in and explained their long term plans, interesting things about the building (it very well may have been a real speakeasy!), and talked to us about the chef. He took about 15 minutes out of his time there to show us around, it was really cool!Overall, I can't recommend this place enough. Go and try it for yourself, I know we'll be back for the smores and cocktails which we were just too stuffed to fit in our stomachs!I had heard great things from friends but the wife and I needed to check it out for ourselves. So we headed down to the cellar. I will say that you really feel like you're in another world when you first enter the cellar through the sliding door. The wife even exclaimed "it's like we're not even in Charlotte anymore". Promptly we were seated and our server was quick to introduce himself and explain the menu and the concept. There was a lot of info to consider, and we perused the extensive beer (both draft and bottle), cocktails, wine and spirit lists. There were definitely some rare beers on draft, but the real rare ones are on the bottle list. Prices for the bottles are overall reasonable, while others are definitely wallet busters. The drafts that we chose were alright but not spectacular. My favorite beer of the night was a peach sour beer from Allagash. It was from a bottle and definitely pricey. The wife switched to a cocktail on the second round, and if her Vieux Carré is any indication of the quality of the cocktails at the cellar, we will become regulars here. I will say that the bar crew seemed to know what they were doing. On to the food, the smoked salmon flatbread was split between us and it was delicious. The flavors of the salmon were perfectly paired with the basil mascarpone spread and fried capers. The flatbread itself is very thin and crispy, not doughy like other flatbreads. The wife got the black grouper entree as her main and the burger sounded too good to pass up for me. First of all, the portion on both entrees and the flatbread were very generous, especially for the price point. My burger was cooked medium or maybe a little under which was perfect. The result was a juicy tasty burger that I will order again and again, along with recommending to others. The wife's grouper was cooked perfectly and the accompanying candied carrots, pesto rice and grilled artichokes complimented well the fish. No room really for a real dessert, but room for a liquid one in the form of a Greenman brewing chocolate stout to spilt between the 2 of us.The service was on point, friendly, informative and engaging in conversation with us about beer, food, etc. I will say that the only drawback was the wooden vintage like high top chairs which are a little clunky and definitely not comfortable for the majority of people. Maybe I felt it more sitting on that chair since others in the booth or the low top tables had really cushy leather chairs. The haves versus the have nots I guess? We shall return often, but may skip if only high tops tables with vintage chairs are available. I would be worth the wait for me to get a cushy leather chair on my next visit.
Chow Mein House=I noticed as I came into this plaza a few days ago that the name had been changed from its previous incarnation and I believe the menu is different also but it was so long since I was here that I don't remember.  I looked at the menu in the window and decided I'd give it a try sometime.I ordered online through the Eat24 ordering available through Yelp checking a pick up time of ASAP.  I ordered one order of vegetable egg rolls (comes four to an order), an order of Singapore vermicelli, and an order of combo chow fun with a note requesting no shrimp.The egg rolls were standard and OK.  The Singapore vermicelli had a pepper symbol next to it on the menu but there was little heat to it at all.  Since this was a take out order, I added crushed red pepper from a Thai restaurant I had leftover onto the vermicelli and I made it peppery on my own.  There was a fair amount of been, chicken , and good sized shrimp.  My wife's combo chow fun was good.  It had a nice tasting sauce and they did not add shrimp as requested because she won't eat shrimp.  The take out order was packed well.  I had a 5 minute wait as they had two orders in front of me and my drive is just about a mile.  I was offered water while I waited and the staff was present.I'll give the place another try.  I could see getting take out from the Chow Mein House from time to time.
Tucky's Smokin BBQ=Yup 5 big smackers for Hendertucky's new prized pig Tucky's. It was finger lickin delicious no doubt!First off if you are an uptight food snob and take yourself too seriously please don't come here. They are brand new so they are still working on the flow of things. Also if you've been to any popular BBQ place across the country you know you have to come and get it before it sells out. They are bbqing the brisket slow and low for 18 hours and it's so popular it does run out along with the ribs! Get there early! You have been warned son!They make the BBQ sauce in house and keep it in warmers. What a concept? It's sooooo good and soooo smooth. Original is sweet, yet balanced and Zesty has hints of pepper. My two friends and I devoured the 4x4 ($24.94) which is four meats and I think three sides. We all agreed the pulled pork was where the party was at as well as the spare ribs! We looked like the wild pigs from Hannibal getting down on this food. Yes, it was that good. Other highlights for me were the Mac n cheese and the sweet cornbread muffin. I asked about the cobbler and they said they haven't perfected the recipe yet so they are not serving it. I like that answer. Overall really good people serving really good food. I can't wait to go back fifty more times!For a brand new business, Tucky's BBQ is solid: The vibe is chill. The service is friendly. And the bbq is bomb. I'd love to give Tucky's more stars but they aren't there yet... My first visit was within a week or so of opening, and it was clear there were a lot of kinks to work out.. A month later, much better but  they still have some room to improve. Tucky's is not a spot to go if you are in a hurry. It is casual, order at the counter service. Each time I have been in there has been a line to do so and the person taking the orders has been friendly but lacked a little pep in their step.  Pricing for BBQ is right where I expect it to be, as compared to both national chains and other locally owned BBQ joints. Platters like the 4x4 or the Carload are a great deal if you have a group of 2-4.  On my first visit, quite a few items were sold out, this is understandable at a newer restaurant and especially at a BBQ spot.... On my more recent visit there was a noticeable improvement, the only item that was sold out was the spare ribs. I am not really a fan of the sides. The mac and cheese is decent enough I suppose, I prefer it to be a bit creamier than how Tucky's does it.  Cornbread is hit or miss, it was a bit stale on my most recent visit. But the meat...  Oh that smoky, sweet delicious meat. I am a rib girl, and Tucky's ribs are meaty and tender and so yummy. My husband enjoyed the brisket which is what he judges all BBQ spots on. The pulled pork is always on point. As others have pointed out, Tucky's epitomizes old Henderson, aka Hendertucky. It's not going to be a spot for everyone. This is not a hifalutin eatery, just some delish bbq served in a very laid back environment.
Phoenix Pho Vietnamese Restaurant=The menu here is not as extensive as in the more established places like Pho Thanh or Da Vang, but enough of the standard favorites are listed to make this a good destination for lovers of Vietnamese food. The food is tasty and very fresh with the requisite herbs and flavors. The restaurant itself is spacious and very clean and the staff members are very friendly and attentive. Note that the restaurant is in the inner corner of a small commercial square, so that it is not readily visible from the road.
Taco Shack=This small taco shop, open less than a week as of this writing, oozes with potential. The good? Quality ingredients. Clean functional décor (Chipotle-like rather than Mexican taco shop). Friendly service. A simple menu with lots of variety. Indoor and outdoor seating. Breakfast available. Television. Great location on University just west of ASU.The not so good? The taco sauce, both green and red, lacked flavor. Definitely needs to be addressed with a reappraisal of these sauces or with more variety. A salsa bar would be ideal. This is Arizona and we are used to heat in our Mexican food. I loved what I ordered and look forward to exploring the rest of the menu, but the taco sauce...The specials seem to be the best values. The #1 (three tacos, rice, beans, tortilla and drink for ten bucks) is a much more substantial meal than ordering tacos ala carte. My taco was not nearly as generously filled as those in the photo posted on Yelp, an understandable consistency issue I suppose for a restaurant still in training and development mode. The tacos, however, are sized more like street tacos, so at $2.75 each it's important that they be generously filled if the nearby starving student population is going to be attracted.I'm giving Taco Shack the benefit of the doubt in the star rating because the restaurant is so new. Hopefully I'll be rewarded over time.
Ramen Ya Katana=I really have to change the light on this spot.  In terms of vegas pricing, this spot is very affordable. Ramen puts you out about $8-$9, versus the $17 other nearby asian joints selling ramen!Please negate a previous reviewer commenting about the plastic cup. Any of these shops on the Grand Bazaar are going to be inclined towards a tourist, or someone else quickly passing through.  It makes no sense to serve ramen in a big ceramic bowl. Why use reusables, and bother with re-cleaning, when most people come in for a pit-stop and continue on? Silverware is more ideal if it offered full dinner service, and someone truly meant to sit and dine for an hour. I don't even think half the shops are connected to a water line, or have a sink.There IS an eating area, but offers very little seating (only well suited for 2's or 4). But come on. You wouldn't come here for dinner. Or with a group.  It's a healthier, Asian, on-the-go. But the food was pretty good! It's flavorful. It hit the spot. Well balanced. Noodles cooked well. The pork was cooked well. I also got seaweed salad, which was good, and a melon soda. Altogether my meal was about $18.Next time I'm in vegas, I'd definitely hit this place up again if I'm staying at Paris or Bally's. Ideal for lunch or a quick bite. The sushi looked pretty good, too. And that was priced about $6 a roll; also pretty reasonable.
J. Gumbo's=My expectations for this place were a lot higher (from reading the reviews and looking at photos) before I drove up and saw a drive-thru lane. This place isn't on par with McDonalds or anything, but it's not about to replace a trip to Lolas either.The red hot chicken is labelled as their hottest dish, and it's an enjoyable buffalo-sauce based building heat that makes me think of wings without the mess. The crawfish etoufee, which I expected to be one of their stronger dishes, was pretty dismal, with minimal heat and a rather bland roux, and large finger-sized pieces of celery. Both dishes were large for the price (under $10/pp), and all dishes seem to be served over rice- a disproportionate amount of it.Service was okay- it's a walk-up style spot. Dining room is clean with Vegas and New Orleans-themed art on the walls. Tables have a variety of hot sauces available, along with a store-brand bottled version. For those outraged about the lack of dishes like alligator, crawfish, etc on the menu, their website offers an explanation that references their commitment to quality and inability to guarantee fresh-sourced specialty products. I'd rather they be straightforward about what they can execute well rather than have dishes they know won't be their best effort.We both ordered the bourbon chicken which was very tasty! The staff is very friendly and sweet. The only issue I have is their inconsistency. I know they are fairly new and still working out the kinks. The bread pudding I ordered this visit was completely different from what I had on my previous visit. It was not executed in the same way, if I order something I expect it to be the same as it was prior unless it is improved. Also the bread they include with your meal has no flavor and is very dry. They should revamp that as it could be so much better or just do away with it. I stand wrong with my love for the bourbon chicken and that won't change. I just hope that stays consistent.
Mini Hot Pot=Asian Comfort FoodGrowing up in East Central Wisconsin, I wasn't exposed to decent Asian food in the wayward days of my youth.  My memories of this cuisine sadly consist primarily of overcooked veggies in gloppy brown sauce.  As a result, I tended to shy away from Asian food in my college and young professional days.  However, after recently taking a job on Madison's south side, I've enjoyed a Renaissance of sorts as I've enjoyed the vibrant flavors of dishes from Ichiban, Orient House and recently SoHo Gourmet Cuisine during my lunchtime forays.  But I really didn't experience Asian comfort food until my recent visit to Mini Hot Pot.  Maybe it was the fact I came in soaked from a mid-November rain, maybe it was because I didn't eat much breakfast during my early morning meeting, but my Spicy Pork Bowl was as a soul soothing dish I've consumed in recent memory.Mini Hot Pot sits in an unpretentious Park Street strip mall next to the Copp's grocery store.  I was immediately greeted by the owner as I entered the restaurant and he expeditiously escorted me to an open table.  The interior of the restaurant (the former home of Mabuhay Philippine) has received a fresh coat of paint and new dark brown flooring.  The restaurant was absolutely spotless, from floor to ceiling.  While there is no booth seating, there are plenty of tables, with built-in heating elements and matching red and black chairs.  While the restaurant offers free wi-fi, I couldn't figure out the password the owner shared with me.My soft-spoken server appeared soon after I took my seat.  He diligently explained the different menu options, but there was a bit of a language barrier, so I didn't quite comprehend all of the information he was sharing.  I've been pigging out on pork lately, so I zeroed in on the prefabricated Spicy Pork Bowl ($7.95), ordered it spicy, and hoped for the best.About five minutes later, my server dropped off my order and I immediately fell completely and hopelessly in love.  The aroma from the garlic and ginger in the potent broth immediately snapped my senses to attention.  To the delight of my taste buds, my hot pot was brimming with thick, chewy noodles, thinly sliced pork, plump dumplings and lightly cooked broccoli. I thoroughly enjoyed the all the variety the flavor-packed dish provided.  The restaurant offers three spice level (mild, spicy hot and super spicy) and the medium level provided appreciated heat without blowing out my palette.   While I normally loath Wisconsin winters, these hot pots are going to help my kick Old Man Winter's ass until spring returns to the Badger state.Throughout the meal, both the owner and the server checked in so see how I liked the meal.  My grin of contentment surely tipped them off that all was well.  They will be seeing plenty of me in the coming months as I explore my way through their menu.  This is yet another fantastic addition to the Park Street dining scene (along with Noosh and El Rancho).  If you're in the area, I highly recommend you pay Mini Hot Pot a visit.
The Little Greek=The gyro I had here is quite possibly the best I've had, ever- and I've had a lot of freaking gyros, trust. The meat is super-tender and flavorful, the pita is perfectly pillowy, and the tzatziki tastes great. They're not stingy about the sauce and feta, either! Efficiency needs a little work. Note that the shop has no seating, it's exclusively a grab-and-go counter. I spent 30+ minutes placing and waiting for an order. Two other customers present during my visit came in to pick up a call-ahead order and both still had to wait quite a bit. They've been open two months, so I would think this had been worked out a little better, but maybe they just haven't found their groove yet. Menu is limited, with a few sandwiches, a salad, and options for pastries. Quality is really decent and prices are very fair.NOTE: They're offering BOGO gyros for their grand opening, so hurry in to take advantage!Gyros are magical because they have the capability to mask the potency of onions. Even an onion hater like me can suddenly consume onions once they're inside a gyro. Unfortunately, the onions inside the gyros at The Little Greek were not the magical kind. They were regular diced onions that smacked me in the face with their spiciness and bitterness. My husband and I each ordered a gyro combo ($8.99), which comes with a gyro with the works, a bag of chips, and a pastry. I got my gyro sans meat, and told the employee to give me extra everything else. I've done this at other gyro places and have never really been disappointed. Here, the gyro was sparse and was about 80% lettuce. There were few tomatoes and I felt there was barely any tzatziki sauce or feta cheese. Even worse, once I took the first bite of my gyro the pita wrap completely crumbled. It's not everyday that I eat a gyro with a fork.  My husband said his meaty gyro was alright. I don't see us returning until a suitable vegetarian option is put on the menu (like falafel) or they at least get fries. If there is a next time, I'll remember to hold the onions.YELP 100 CHALLENGE 2015: #258
Jessie Rae's BBQ=I don't understand where everyone else went, but my food didn't match the raving reviews.  Grabbed takeout at 11:30AM on a weekday, and the food was disappointing. Maybe we came on an off day, but it was hard to find anything to like, though we were unable to try the ribs, which sound like their best meat option.SERVICE:  An hour after opening, they were out of ribs. When my boyfriend  expressed surprise, she said "this happens every day." Uh, basic supply and demand would then suggest you make more. W e'd planned to split a three meat plate. Now, with only brisket and chicken left, we'd have to double up on one. To do so, we were charged an extra $7 for the double brisket. This is ridiculous, and we were put in the position to do so by the lack of other available meats. Takeout box was put  on the counter, had to get bags and utensils separately. If the majority of your orders are for takeout, perhaps someone should be bagging up orders appropriately.  Just a thought.THE FOODBRISKET: My initial thoughts were complimentary. But as we got away from the edges of the piece of meat and into the interior, the meat became dry and unappealing. The brisket was the best of what we tried, but we didn't finish it.CHICKEN: It was fall off the bone tender, but lacked flavor and was also on the dry side. This went unfinished as well.MAC AND CHEESE: I found it interesting, and kind of fun, that they used bowtie pasta for the mac. But it was falling apart and the only flavor seemed to be from the seasoing sprinkled on top. The first few bites were fine, but again, as we got more into the dish and the noodles broke into pieces and the seasoning was gone, flavor was very one note. I do like that they were nicely saucy (dry mac is the worst offense!), but this version was lacking.SAUCES: Okay, even average bbq can be made to shine with a good sauce. BF grabbed two different types for us to try and both were gross. One was sickeningly sweet with a chemical-like after taste we couldn't place, while the other (the Godfather?) was similarly sweet but with a punch of pepper. This wasn't balanced, it was just pepper. No bueno! I may be from Texas and used to great bbq, but after two years in Vegas, I've scaled back my expectations-- and even so, this spot didn't meet them.  Perhaps I'd feel differently if I tried the ribs everyone raves about, but I don't feel inclined to give them another try for a while.OK take a look at the pics, enough said. Fine I'll make it longer.Jessie Rae's BBQ is a small BBQ joint that you'll should try if you haven't already done so. Yea they're small 10 slim people could maybe fit inside. There were only 2 tables and a few stools on the inside and a few tables on the outside. They get busy during lunch and I've heard they do run out so come early. Got there at 11:30 am no one was there but a few minutes later it was packed.Obviously when it comes to BBQ everyone is gonna have their favorites mines ribs and brisket and of course that's what I went with. The ribs here were tasty. It had a nice bark, a good smoke ring, and was real tender. Mmm I'm craving these ribs right now. The brisket I got were served a little cold, not sure if that's how they usually do it but would've enjoyed them warm or hot at least. Will need to try again.If you like sauces on your BBQ they have three of them. The Pig Sweat which is their Carolina style vinegar sauce, the Fallen Angel which is their spicy sauce made from Carolina reaper peppers supposingly one of the spiciest peppers out there, and their God Sauce which I didn't get to try. Enjoyed the Fallen Angel and didn't care to much for the Pig Sweat.They also have these things where it starts with a pile of waffle fries, mash potatoes, or mac n cheese then top it with sauces, cheese, spices, and meat. Doesn't look like its good for you but I want one. I'm for sure going back.
The Cheesecake Factory=OK Cheesecake Factory (CCF), I am waiting for you to finally come around and show me what you're really made of. After being told last Saturday that a party of 5 would have a 2 hour wait to get a table not including the 50 minutes it would take just to get a buzzer,(yes... 50 minutes just to get a buzzer) it is difficult for me to justify how the food is worth such a wait. I understand that the CCF is a hot commodity around Madison making its recent debut but there has to be a better system for seating people faster than some 3 hours! You'd thought Bobby Flay was the Head Chef with waiting time that long. I did dine at the CCF on its grand opening for dinner. Since it was only a party of 2 around dinner time, we were seated immediately. Drink was good I must say. Bartender did a great job hooking me up. Food however came out cold and way over spiced. My Cajun Paster had so much creold seasoning in it, my dish was black! Had heartburn the rest of the night. Understanding it was the CCF first day of operations, I was willing to give them a pass and return 3 weeks later to only be told it would be a 3 hour wait. No thanks!I prefer the CCF in Brookfield, WI. It seems to be a bigger restaurant and offers great natural light unlike the one at West Towne Mall. I may return one day not anytime soon.Like several reviewers here, I have been to Cheesecake Factory restaurants in other locations, enjoyed my various experiences, and was excited to see one land in Madtown. But...oh, boy...The place was hopping at noon on the Monday before Christmas--admittedly one of the busiest times we could have possibly chosen. Lucky for me, my party was already seated in the bar when I arrived. The decor seemed swanky and modestly cool, but the first thing that struck me as I sat down was that the bar tables are far too small for a party of four to comfortably sit and eat lunch (amazingly, though, no disasters with water glasses or plates happened during our meal). The noise level was really quite uncomfortable. My party had ordered nachos as an appetizer, which gave me some time to peruse the menu and order. Quite a bit more time, it turned out, than I needed. 35 minutes later, the nachos arrived, followed shortly after (5 minutes) by our entrees. Our waitress, to her credit, was clearly annoyed that the food had arrived as it did. Back to my order. It was foggy and miserable outside, so I was in the mood for comfort food. I am a sucker for Shepherd's Pie, which I ordered despite the misnomer: SHEPherds herd what? SHEEP. Like, uh, lamb. (C'mon man, ground beef makes it COTTAGE pie! But, whatever.) When the entree arrived, it looked fine, albeit with an entire parsley sprig plopped unceremoniously on top (I tore off some leaves and shredded them over the dish). But my first bite revealed the insidious truth: hiding out beneath the copious mashed potatoes and gravy was...not ground beef. Not in the traditional sense. You see, my dish appeared to be a subterfuge for hamburger patties that had not made the cut at the grill (it didn't take much for my imagination to slide to the slimy bottom of that slippery slope--GAAAACK!). Many of the huge chunks of torn-up patty were burnt on one side or both, and all of them were quite bland. (Which made me wonder about the quality of the hamburgers--but I'll leave that for some other hapless patron to review!) A few vegetables had been tossed in and the mix was slathered in gravy, then cleverly hidden under fluffy mounds of cheesy mashed potatoes. After a few bites of this vile concoction, I ate enough of the mashed potatoes to fill me up--as in, the part that was not in contact with the slop--and left the rest. There were no questions from the waitress when she took my almost entirely slop-filled plate. It didn't matter, because I would not have ordered anything else: I was too grossed out. The very idea of re-purposed food makes me gag.So...to recap. Long wait. Loud. Slow service. Expensive. Truly sub-par food. Sounds like a job for Kitchen Nightmares.Need I say that I won't be back?
Portillo's Hot Dogs=One of the irritating inevitabilities about living in The Valley is eventually being unable to escape some douchebag who migrated here from ANY OTHER METROPOLITAN AREA, and drones on incessantly about how much better things are "BACK HOME."Chicagoans might very well be the worst.Enter Portillo's.Know somebody from Chicago? (Who doesn't? They're everywhere. Like cockroaches.) Ask them about Portillo's, and you'll never get them to shut up. "Dis is da gratess hot dug effer." "you kain't git hot dugs like dis in Feenix." "I'd keel yoo for a Portillo's"On and on.It's a hot dog guys, nothing more, nothing less. You'd do just as well from a CART GUY ON A DOWNTOWN STREET CORNER.We arrived at the new Tempe location and parking situation was a clusterf**k-zoo, which I can't see getting any better any time soon. Portillo's DID have staff poised in the lot to assist, but they seemed just as confused as most of the drivers.Inside? Holy Crap. Cavernous and full. Very busy, very loud and very colorful. Portillo's has a standard walk up counter for ordering, but today we were greeted by order takers who would then hand back our written orders to give to the people behind the counter. After paying, you are given a number and guided to the other end of the restaurant to wait at an "order up" counter. BTW, the lady working the mike and calling order numbers was extremely irritating, sounding like a carnival barker and, for some reason, feeling it was necessary to add a rhyming quip to every number called.I think this Portillo's was purposely over-staffed because it was grand-opening week, and they were still working out the kinks.ONE KINK IN SERIOUS NEED OF A WORK OUT was delivery and presentation. we ordered 2 JUMBO CHILI DOGS, 1 LARGE CHEESE FRY AND A LARGE ROOT BEER. We waited 20 minutes and what we got was a soggy lukewarm mess. We were confused as to why were asked "for here, or to go" when we ordered, as, even though we clearly stated we were dining in, we were handed a paper sack of food and a drink TO GO.Chili dogs don't wrap in paper very well. So what we unwrapped was a couple of smashed, room temperature messes with half the chili sticking to the paper wrapping. The dog was only ok, the chili generic, and they were a little too generous with the onions, but like I said before, "HEY IT'S JUST A HOT DOG." In this instance, a hot dog with absolutely nothing special going on. The cheese fries were hot and tasty with the cheese served on the side (again, in a to go cup). Not nearly enough cheese to satisfy the large order of spuds though, and I later noticed it was the same sized cup of cheese that came with the small order of fries too.I would discount this place as just another not worth it FRANCHISE OF THE "BACK-HOMERS," and the parking situation really does need a fix. But just as we were finishing up, I spied a rather frail elderly lady hoisting a ITALIAN BEEF, and man, did she look happy. Happy enough, in fact, to make me want to go back to Portillo's and give it another shot, this time with the ITALIAN BEEF.However, if you're just looking for a hot dog to throw down for lunch, see the guy on the street corner and avoid the Portillo's hassle.After all, IT'S JUST A HOT DOG.***********************************************************************UPDATE ALERT!!!***********************************************************************9/21/13Ok....went back and tried that Italian Beef I referred to earlier. Nope. Nothing special. Not bad, not great. There are a lot of "CHICAGO JOINTS" in The Valley. So far, none can hold a candle to LUKE'S Italian Beef.Just as many employees as the first time, but, even though Portillo's was much less crowded than the first time I went (is the luster really wearing off that fast?), the employees seemed even less organizedOnce again, our food took a little too long to come, and was, once again packed TO GO even though we specifically, ONCE AGAIN, said we were dining in.Overall, after 2 trips to Portillo's, nothing special or worth the crowd, wait time, or parking hassle.I HATE having to leave this review because the Portillos in Scottsdale blew me away when I first heard of this chain. My 1st visit to this Portillos in Tempe, was this past weekend. I was super excited for I was traveling from QC to Scottsdale and new this location had just opened and I had to pass it to get to my friends house! Why not try it out since the other location is out of the way and FAR from me! I was soooo super excited I think I may have exceeded the speed limit to get there! LOL! The drive through was pretty thorough and awesome when I arrived. You had very nice (but crazy people, because they are standing outside all day in this heat) taking your order. I ordered my norm, chili cheese hot dog and chili chesses fries. My ordered was confirmed by at least 3 different people walking down the drive through taking orders and by the person who collects payment; they were all very nice and quick. I pulled up to the last person who brought me my order (even repeated my exact order back to me), super happy my order came out before the 2 cars ahead of me (how nice and fast) left the drive through and rushed to my friends to devour my delicious food. When I got home and opened up my bad of deliciousness I was completely disappointed!!! Immediate sad face! I received the wrong order! You know the feeling you get when your parents tell you you're going to Disneyland and they end up taking you to the doctor instead? It felt like that, the build up of awesomeness, then the tremendous sadness in the end! I was so sad and frustrated, for you are looking forward in enjoying a delicious meal and you receive an order you don't even want. I received a regular hot dog with mustard.... it would have been fine and I wouldn't be upset if I liked mustard, if I liked mustard a tiny bit, but I completely cant stand the taste of mustard, I hate it. I tried scraping the mustard off the hot dog and throwing the bun away, but it still had its mustard taste, so I tossed it! My chili cheese fries ended up being normal fries, so I ate those and pouted! I know things happen in the drive through ever now and then, it was just frustrating for my order was repeated to me so many times, there was no way I felt I even needed to check it before I left the drive through. Then getting all the way home to eat it and it not being the right order is just frustrating. It's a waste of money and then a waste of gas to drive back to get my correct order. I will try to give Tempe another chance if I am in the area and checking my order every time will be a must now! You wont find me driving out of my way to try it again though :(As the Chicago area hot dog critic one thing I've noticed is that when traveling to other metropolitan areas hot dogs aren't nearly as popular other places as they are in Chicagoland. I did a search for hot dog stands near where I'm staying during my trip to the Phoenix Arizona area and found a place called "Ted's Hot Dogs" and the next closest place was immediately familiar. It was Portillo's, a very popular and abundant chain started in suburban Chicago that has apparently made its way to Arizona.I finally had a chance to stop by and the first thing that I noticed is that it's every bit as busy as the Chicagoland locations. The parking lot was completely packed and there was very little available seating inside. There were also tables outside, but people had birds coming up to their tables,sometimes managing to get away with a french fry before fluttering off.  Now, I've been to the Chicago area Portillo's many times and have reviewed a few locations. As a child I met Dick Portillo on a number of occasions and used to be a very big fan of Portillo's as a chain. Over the years, the quality control at Portillo's has diminished. The same quality ingredients are being used, but it seems like the training on how to properly assemble hot dogs, burgers, and everything else has suffered. Or management has simply stopped paying as vigorous attention to quality control. With a location over a thousand miles from Chicagoland I wondered if the menu would be different, if the way things were made would be different, and if being so far away the same degradation in food preparation that has infected the Chicagoland locations was present here.Upon walking in and looking around it sure looked and felt like a Portillo's. I didn't thoroughly inspect the menu as my order was taken while in line by a lady who wrote it down on the back of a bag, it appeared to be the same as the Chicago locations. I placed my order, and then got into the pick-up line to wait for my food. One trend I've noticed at the Chicago locations is repeated rhymes based on your order number. So they would call out things like "Number two, your order is due", "Number three come see me". I noticed with certain numbers they were doing the rhyming as well (this must be something they train on), but it wasn't the constant irritation of hearing it at the Chicagoland locatons to the point where you're trapped in a Dr. Seuss book.Finally my food was ready and I struggled to find an open seat without subjecting myself to eating outside where birds interrupting my meal was nearly a certainty. I finally sat down took my food out and snapped a picture. This was a regular Portillo's hot dog. The problem is we had the same inconsistent preparation we see at the Chicago area locations.For any of those reading this review that are unfamiliar with what a Chicago style hot dog should be, I'll go over the basics. A Chicago style hot dog has a few different variations. The version served by Portillo's is the most traditional style which is an all-beef natural casing sausage. The natural casing is skin that when properly heated will give the frankfurter a nice bit of resistance and a snap when you bite into it. The classic Chicago style hot dog comes on a poppy seed bun which has been steamed to become soft and easy to bite into. It has a pickle spear or slice, tomato slice, sport peppers, bright green relish mustard, onion and celery salt on it. Ketchup is considered to be the worst possible addition to a Chicago-style hot dog as the sweetness overpowers the flavor of the other ingredients.So how did the Portillo's of Tempe hot dog fare? The sausage itself was fine, but the relish application was a bit excessive. This added to the biggest problem,  the bun was steamed  too much along with being causing it to become a tad soggy. As a result the back half of the hot dog dissolved as I picked it up forcing me to struggle to finish the rest without getting my hands wet and sticky. The taste of the hot dog was roughly on par with other Portillo's, the big problem being a bit too thick of a pickle spear. I also got fries with cheese sauce. These fries were a litle over cooked, I'd say they were crispy but a few were so crisp there was no potato paste to be extracted from the inside. My overall impression is that this isn't any worse than the Chicago area Portillo's on any given day. But Portillo's food quality isn't what it used to be either. I did notice quite a few people at this Portillo's with Chicago themed shirts, Bears and Bulls jerseys. While I'm sure Chicago transplants and visitors only make up a small fraction of their clientele, it struck me as interesting. This is especially true since there doesn't seem to be a lot of other Chicago themed eateries around the area. Overall, I'm going to give my Portillo's experience here two stars. But for the Phoenix area readers your mileage may vary as its unique to the area.After all the hype about Portillo's coming to Tempe Marketplace and the photos friends had posted on Yelp, I was looking forward to trying this place. I've never been to Chicago, but I've had a delicious Chicago style hot dog before. I figured Portillo's had to serve up a hot dog better than the one I had from a food truck in Phoenix. Honestly, the one I tried tonight from Portillo's was not any better. On a positive note, the Beef Hot Dog "with everything" ($2.65) had good flavor with all the fixings: mustard, relish, freshly chopped onions, sliced red tomatoes, kosher pickle spear, and sport peppers. My primary complaint was that the "perfectly steamed" poppy seed bun was pretty soggy from all the fixings by the time I got home. It seems that the hot dog might best be enjoyed in the restaurant as the bun doesn't stand up very well - or maybe they should serve the fixings on the side for customers taking the hot dog to-go. The onion rings ($2.19) were pipping HOT and crispy, but lacked much in the way of flavor - definitely nothing noteworthy. The customer service was excellent! The drive though service seemed like a souped-up version of the In & Out experience: a person takes your order outside (instead of an intercom at the menu), another person confirms your order and collects your payment (also outside by walking up to your vehicle), finally a third person grabbed my order from the window and brought it to my car. This doesn't seem like the most efficient system (and unlikely sustainable during the summer months) but it's a nice attempt to make the experience more welcoming and customer-focused. Overall: good, not great experience tonight. I will return to try other offerings and re-evaluate. Thanks to a fellow Yelper (shout-out to Irina), I was surprised to learn that they actually have vegetarian and pescatarian sandwiches which have received positive reviews. Next time, maybe I'll have to try the Grilled Tuna Sandwich or the Halibut Sandwich!I don't get it. It's a lame hotdog in a soggy bun with annoying seeds. It also had neon green relish that had next to no flavor. I ate it because I was hungry and on the way to the bar. But otherwise I would never come back. We also ordered fries which look like the frozen Oreida kind you get in the super market and make at home. They even have the nerve to charge you for ranch dressing for the french fries! Nuts! Not returning.Lets start off with the cons of this placeCons: No combo mealsNo kid mealsIts literally right up the street from me (this is bad , very bad LOL )If you can get over that, then I guess you will be okI have been a few times now and I have to say they are slowing winning me over. The 1st time I went I swore I would never go back the 2nd time I went I thought damn this is a good hot dog the 3rd time I went I had to admit I am a fan.I love the Chicago style dog, I always order the Portillos all beef dog, it comes with mustard (big win for me since I'm not a fan of catsup) relish, freshly chopped onions, nice slices of tomato, a quartered dilled pickle and hot peppers all saflely bounded together by a perfectly steamed poppy seed bun and all this for just $2.65!! LOVE IT! When you check out there menu you will see they have a lot going on, from hot dogs, to sandwiches to burgers, to salads even soup & deserts and for you veggin love fools they even have a meatless menu too, so Im sure there is something for every picky eater out there.If you haven't given Portillos a try, I think you should, if they didn't win you over the 1st, like me, go back and try it again, believe me it wasn't love at 1st bite for me either but now I'm a fan!4.5 starsI have passed this Portillo's many times.  If I am headed down this way, it is usually down the street a few more miles to go to Ted's.  My intent was to get some dogs at Ted's again today but when I pulled off the 202 and McClintock, I had a strong craving for Portillo's cheese fries.  Something about that magical cup of hot, melted cheese sauce reeled me in.I finally figured out the perfect order at Portillo's.  2 Jumbo Dogs and a Large Cheese Fries.  This comes in at just under $10.00 and it is well worth it.  I have had other things at Portillo's (sausages, Italian beef, salads, etc) but nothing is as good as their Jumbo Hot Dogs.  I get mine topped with mustard, onion and that neon green relish.  They are a hefty sized dog with a little bit of a snap to them.  These dogs are laid in a nicely steamed poppy seed bun. They are flat out delicious and filling!  For their fries, they use a crinkle cut fry.  They aren't the best fries in the world but because of the crinkle cut design, they are the perfect fry to dip in that molten lava cheese sauce.  It coats all the nooks and crannies of the fry and makes it one hell of a dip!I'm sure I will be back soon enough!  Service was very attentive and friendly and this place is pretty easy to get to.  The parking lot is a little confusing if you aren't paying attention, but if you can navigate that and get inside the door, great hot dogs and cheese fries are waiting for you!"The noblest of all dogs is the hot-dog; it feeds the hand that bites it."  ― Lawrence J. PeteAlways a great place to grab a quick bite.  Located on the outer region of Tempe Marketplace, this place is great.  Lots of parking, ample seating, and fast!  Pay attention for your order number if you decide to grab a seat instead of waiting at the counter.I like grabbing a Portillo's all-beef hot dog.  What's not to love about a Chicago-style dog?  It's no Superdawg but it's a super dog!  Mustard, Play-Doh green sweet relish, freshly-chopped onions, two slices of tomatoes, a kosher pickle, and sport peppers nestle up against a hot dog in a steamed poppy seed bun.  Mmm!  Don't even touch this beast with ketchup or I'll throw my shoe at you.  For $2.85, I usually have to refrain myself from getting two.  It's cheap but I like to get other items besides hot dogs.  The Beef-n-cheddar croissant with both hot and sweet peppers... oh man.  Need I say more?  The Char-grilled Maxwell Street Style Polish is pretty darn great as well.  It's an explosion of grilled onions, mustard, and a meaty sausage [That's what she said].  All in all, it's a great place to grab a bite without breaking the wallet.  All that grease for such a low price.  ;)After reading Joyce W's review, I starved myself all day so I could relive her experience in person.  Upon walking in, I noticed the place was huge.  So many places to sit.  I liked the yesteryear vibe.  Thankfully, I followed a young couple in, as I had no idea what to do.  I found out, you need to walk to the back of the restaurant to place your order.As I waited for my order to come up, I enjoyed the young lady calling out the tickets as they came up.One-nine-zero, you're my hero.  One-nine-one, your order is done.  One-nine-two, we've got an order right here for you. One-nine-three, come see me. One-nine-four, wait no more.   One-nine-five, look alive.  One-nine-six, come get your Portillos fix.  One-nine-seven, (I didn't hang long enough to hear this rhyme).  One-nine-eight, no more wait.  One-nine-nine, it's your time to dine.  Two-oh-oh, you're good to go.When I sat down with my order, I bit into the signature hot dog, and it has a good snap.  However, my beef and cheddar croissant was so greasy it literally turned its paper wrapping translucent.  I texted Joyce a photo, and she remarked that they must hate me.  Yes, of course, it all made sense now.  The bread was too thick for me, and I tossed most of it.  The crinkle cut fries were okay.  I'll try the pasta, ribs or salad next time, with my dog.I'd never have imagined finding a Midwestern/Chicago staple so far away from the Midwest! This AZ location is set up exactly as the other ones I'd been to in the Chicagoland area - you can see everything done behind the counter, the lines and tables are the same, etc. Thankfully when I met up with one my friends here the lines were nonexistent and it wasn't terribly busy. First things first - gotta order a Cake Shake! She wasn't aware of their existence, so at my insistence she ordered one - hallelujah! I also got a plain hotdog with peppers to liven things up, and I knew a #CakeShake wouldn't hold me over until dinner. The employees were nice, the place was clean, all wonderful. Cannot wait to return for a more proper Chicago meal.I've heard a lot of really good things about this place but every time I come by, it's always too packed to try.  My co-worker and I noticed the drive-thru line only had 2 cars during lunch rush so we jumped at the chance to check it out.  To my amazement they had someone outside taking orders, at noon, in the hottest state in the country during the hottest month of the year with no shade.  After we turned the corner we saw a second person standing next to the menu and speaker box collecting money, again no shade or water in sight.  I was completely appalled by Portillo's inhumane treatment of their staff.  I wouldn't treat a dog like this and especially not an employee providing a service for me.  I understand that there are jobs which require individuals to work outside under the extreme conditions of an Arizona summer but the drive-thru line of a fast food restaurant isn't one of them.  So what if your customers have to sit and wait in their air conditioned car a few minutes longer for their fast food, it's no excuse to make two human beings stand outside in 110 degree heat when you have a functioning speaker box and two windows to pass money and food.As for the food, my co-worker enjoyed his dog but my burger was in styrofoam which is well known to trap moisture so my bun was soggy and my burger fell apart.
Sushiholic=We stopped in here for a quick dinner tonight because it is the newest sushi place in the neighborhood and we've been meaning to try it! We were excited to find that we made it just in time for happy hour because it goes until 7 PM! The Sushi HH prices were good, although we did have a few problems with our order as they weren't made to match what the menu said. They also don't give itemized receipts and i'm pretty positive that our total was wrong! When we brought it to their attention, they weren't able to reverse the charges. Oh well, they ended up giving us a gift certificate to make up for the wrong total. I am giving them 3 stars because they are brand new {...they don't even have a liquor license yet!} and have to work the bugs out! We will give it another shot! :)
Doh Korean BBQ=Doh Korean BBQ is a new Ayce Kbbq on the southwest/west side. They are part of the same restaurant group as Doh Sushi, Tofu Hut, and J Karaoke on Spring Mountain Rd. They are also located in the popular shopping complex that houses gelato shop Gelotology, coffee place Seranade, and the Rice n Noods. These guys are doing a solid job and it's a welcome addition to this neighborhood.They have a couple of different menus; lunch, dinner 1, and dinner 2. Lunch is available until 3pm, Dinner 1 includes everything for lunch plus short ribs, and Dinner 2 includes everything for Dinner 1 plus rib eye. I chose lunch this time, but I would like to come again to try the dinners.What I noticed first, Doh is using the more modern vents that more places are switching over to, a smaller fan that sucks up the smoke that is adjustable, rather than the old fashioned hoods that creates a lot of noise. After ordering, the food quickly started rolling out.The banchan was good, and their kimchi is very good, aged correctly. The steamed egg came out, and it was good as well, nice and fluffy, without being watery. My meats then started coming out. The brisket is excellent as well as their beef tongue. I thought their bulgogi is good, not at the Gen level, but good nonetheless.The service was excellent, with my server asking if I needed anything, and asking if everything is good, which it was.While Tofu Hut has been declining in service and food quality progressively through the years, I'm glad to report that Doh shows that a brand can reinvent themselves. Oh yea, one more thing...Ftr Ftr Ftr Ftr Ftr Ftr Ftr Ftr Ftr Ftr Ftr Ftr Ftr Ftr Ftr Ftr Ftr Ftr Ftr Ftr Ftr Ftr Ftr Ftr Doh!!!!
Pho Vegas=Uh-oh. I think Kinh Do and Dakao have some competition on their hands- the bahn mi here are cheap, huge, and tasty, with an incredible bread! The sandwiches are usually pretty low-priced but the version here is a "foot long" - literally two huge halves, double the portion that you get elsewhere, for only a buck or so more. My usual complaint about bahn mi is the lackluster bread- but here, it is fresh baked, fluffy, and beautiful. It almost reminds me of a challah bread. I'm definitely coming back here for more sandwiches, though the selection is a bit limited . Grab the dac biet!The namesake pho is also a good option- broth was lighter than is typical around town, and meat was an average portion but less fatty than cuts served at other shops. Large and small sizes are offered, typically under $10. Two of us split a large and didn't finish it. I was a bit surprised to see the pho included sliced white onions. Menu has some healthier-sounding options, including a chicken pho and a shrimp version.The spring rolls were the only item we were slightly less than blown away by- portion of two rolls came nicely plated and generously served with two cups of creamy peanut sauce. However, the filling seemed to be mostly shredded iceberg lettuce with the protein/noodles. Everything was fresh and priced appropriately though ($5).Service was attentive and friendly- much more so than I'm used to receiving at a Vietnamese place, to be honest. The massive order above was $22 for two before tip, and was enough food to leave an entire roll and half a sandwich for my lunch the following day. I'll be back!Still comparing vermicelli bowls in town, I found myself here. The glowing reviews made me do admit, I must admit.It's located in an old strip mall along Sahara Ave. The place was empty and the air smelled like old grease - the type that sticks to your hair and clothes, a pet peeve of mine.Should I get pho? Banh mi? Rice combo? Appetizers? Bun Thit Nuong Cha Gio:Huge portion. Lots of noodles, egg rolls and meat. However, I was not impressed by the taste of the egg rolls. I didn't like them at all and I just can't figure out what exactly I didn't like about it. Were they fishy and salty? Maybe. I haven't had this dish I did not finish so, this was a first. 2/5Com Dac Biet:Steamed rice with grilled pork, sausage, pork cake, and egg. Pork cake? Por que? It's not what you think it is. It's like meatloaf slices made of pork. 3/5Banh Mi Thit Nuong:A huge fat sandwich with grilled pork and veggies. Oh my goodness, this thing is thick and delicious. They bake the bread on premise so, when you get your sandwich it is so lovely and warm. You'll ask, "where have you been all my life?" Whatever bad things I said in the previous paragraphs, just disregard them. Their Banh mi more than made up for everything. Your first bite, the warm flakey crunchy bread...oh, my! And it's packing some good meat...lots of it. It's just perfection. It's about $6 and it can feed 2 people. Those places that sell sub  sandwiches has nothing on this. 5/5So, yes, come here for the Banh mi and take it to-go. Skip the egg rolls.
Chon Thai Food=So I was invited by Jib W to come try this new Thai restaurant. It's only been open for three weeks and I love these family owned places. I was a little hesitant to come here cause my family really doesn't like spicy food and all these reviews are giving them five stars (no one gets all five stars). What the heck, just told my family we're going to this Thai restaurant tonight. Came here for a early Saturday dinner. Very interesting when you first walk in. Looks very clean, very new with a modern Asia flare. We were greeted when we walked in by the waiter. Smiling and thanking us for coming in. Very friendly. I started off with a Thai coffee and my wife had a Thai iced tea. Both were good but really sweet. Little bit too sweet to my taste but it was very good. We started off with two appetizers the Chicken Chon Thai rolls and the Sweet & Sour Wings. I was going to order the spring rolls but our waiter said the Chon rolls are special. Can't get this anywhere else. It came with three rolls sliced in half. So the rolls were ok. Couldn't tell what was in the rolls but putting the sauces on the rolls was good. Nice and crispy. The sweet & sour wings were a little spicy and good. Liked the sauce on the wings. Little sweet yet spicy. Really liked it. I had the Crispy Garlic Chicken with a side of sticky rice. Huge portion of chicken. Fried with this garlic sauce and asked for medium heat. It's was really good with dried basil leafs. Enjoyed it. Crispy but not dry inside. Moist. Really likes the sauce but couldn't really taste the heat. My daughter got her favorite Drunken Beef Noodles. I got a taste and it was really good. Loved the beef and the noodles. Unfortunately my daughter finished off her dish and she really liked it. My wife got the Chon Thai Seafood Special. It had shrimp, scallops, calamari and other stuff with no heat. Thought it was really good. It came with a side of rice too. Seafood was cooked really good with nice spices and really good portions. So for dessert, we got fried banana ice cream. It had a nice portions of fried bananas with ice cream in the middle with whip cream. Really good. The fried banana had a little taste of coconut. We could barely finish it but It was so good. So the service was outstanding. Our service was the tall Asian man who I found out is the cousin of the cooks. The cooks is a mom and pop show. So he was really good. Very thoughtful. Always thanking us. Filling out water glasses and pulling the dirty dishes. So we had a really good time tonight. Good Thai food, excellent service, and a nice friendly ambiance. What else could you ask for. Oh yea, prices were reasonable too. Enjoy. We sure did.When you eat food that's too hot and start breathing like Mu Shu the Dragon.I was invited by Jib W. to try out this new family-owned restaurant and everything went great!  They have only been opened just shy of a month and the place had a steady stream of customers throughout the night.  I was pretty excited by the time we were seated.  Since this is a family-owned restaurant, the service was excellent.  From the tall courteous waiter to the young sweet waitress, everyone here was super friendly.  After browsing the menu for a bit, we had decided to order a Tom Kha Chicken, Chicken Pumpkin Curry, Crispy Panang Chicken, and shared a Fried Banana with Ice Cream for dessert.  If you know me, you know I love me some Tom Kha and their Tom Kha is super fragrant.  It was delicious, had great citrus flavor, and super smooth.  I just love hot and sour coconut soup!  My only regret is not getting the large like I originally wanted.  The small is a good size but it was just too good to be shared. Now I'm normally a creature of habit and usually order massaman curry but the Chicken Pumpkin Curry piqued my interest --- so glad I ordered this.  I seriously couldn't stop eating.  I didn't miss the potatoes in a massaman curry at all because the pumpkin was AMAZING.  I loved the texture.  And at medium spice, it was absolutely perfect.  As for the Crispy Panag Chicken, it was delish.  I didn't put 2 and 2 together to realize we ordered two curry dishes on top of our coconut milk based soup so I was overwhelmed by coconut milk and that food coma afterwards hit hard [like a little baby who had too much milk lol].  And when we were stuffed to the brim and contemplating on going to EOS Fitness afterwards, we were offered dessert and just couldn't say no.  A beautiful dish of Fried Banana with a mountain of Ice Cream and whipped cream was placed in front of us.  We shared a look of, "What did we get ourselves in to?" before diving in.  I've been scarred in the past from soggy fried bananas in grossly thick tempura batter but this place does no such thing.  Had I been wearing a skirt, it would have flipped!  The ice cream had coconut and maybe some pineapple in it and it was good.  Like really really good.  The bananas stayed crisp and was perfect.  Although we were happily full, we managed to eat the whole thing.  No shame.All in all, it was a perfect dinner --- amazing service, a clean modern restaurant, some soft tunes in the background, and delicious food!  And with Chon Thai Food being two miles away from home, I will DEFINITELY be back!  Seriously, come stop by this great Thai eatery.  You won't be disappointed!What happens when really good food is topped by stellar service?  Five stars!I was invited out by "Aunt" Jib, to try out her family's new Thai restaurant.  After informing our waiter of this, and he lit up like a Christmas tree.  This guy was very happy... like a happy that's contagious...Looking at the apps, we decided on their Chon Thai Chicken rolls, which were fabulously crispy on the outside, and creamy on the inside, by what I can only assume to be potatoes???  It was served with a sweet spicy sauce and diced cucumbers and red onions, which gave it nice crunch and fresh flavor.The Chicken Tom Kha was delicious, with its coconut broth and bobbing mushrooms.My companion ordered the Drunken Beef Noodles and I went with the Panang Curry with Beef.  I adored both dishes, but was even more impressed when the waitress told me that I can call ahead, and place a special order for mussamun (pronounced "muss a mun", not "moose sa moon") curry, as its not on the menu.  For me?  You'd make a special dish just for me?  WHO DOES THAT?!?!Then, as if they hadnt been kind enough, our waiter asks us not to go anywhere because he has a surprise.  A surprise for me?  What could it be?  A sword?  Clown makeup?  Singing lessons?  Wonderful gift ideas raced through my mind, but none were as tasty as the mango and sticky rice dessert which was placed before us.On our way out, my companion mentioned to our waiter, how much we enjoyed his service, and he said that her words was the nicest thing that's happened all day.  My companion said he was the nicest thing that's happened all day.$5.99 lunch specials! With such a great deal and with numerous 5 star reviews, we knew we had to check this restaurant out for lunch. The interior is relaxing and elegant with a nicely laid out space.There are several lunch specials to choose from and they include a piece of crab rangoon and your choice of soup or salad. The soup for the day was a vegetable soup, which I chose with my red curry chicken, Thai hot. Preparing in advance for the spicy feast to come, I also ordered a Thai iced tea ($2).The Thai iced tea had a lovely ombre transition from creamy white to rich auburn. It was almost too pretty to mix up to even out the cream and tea (Almost). It was served in a tower-like tall glass. It was an excellent compliment to the bold, spicy flavor of the red curry, which had a hearty amount of meat and a variety of nicely cooked vegetables. As Thai hot, it was actually the penultimate level of spiciness, as the "super hot" was the one spicy level to rule them all. They definitely delivered on the spice end, and I thought the heat level was appropriate for Thai hot. As for the crab rangoon and the soup, they were pretty plain and served more as filler for the meal. Service was excellent and the young gentleman here especially did an admirable job making sure everyone was satisfied with their meals.So, exceptional service, great prices, and a lovely atmosphere. How can you go wrong? :)
Madistan=Five stars because:1. DELICIOUS food2. Super reasonably priced3. The nicest staff1. My beef kebab roll was outstanding. The beef was perfectly juicy and flavorful. The lamb shawarma and fries also taste great.2. I don't know where else you can get a meal in Madison for 5.99. One of the best values in town.3. The friendly folks behind the counter are really why I am rooting for this spot. They were polite, smiled and were really helpful.It's not fast food, so don't go if you need to be in and out in 5 minutes (or call ahead). I really hope they start offering delivery and late night food!
Burgatory=I was on the North Shore last night and was looking for dinner after going to the 21+ night at the Carnegie Science Center.  Given that I'd seen a few photos posted from this new Burgatory in the past couple of days, I knew it was finally open, so I decided to check it out.  Having been to the Waterworks and Waterfront branches, I knew what to expect, and fortunately, this Burgatory delivered.  My dining partner and I started by splitting a cookie monster shake.  It was delicious, with lots of cookie chunks, and provided just the right amount for both of us.  The kitchen also honored my request to go light on the whipped cream, an option I recommend if you don't like mounds of whipped cream on your shake.For our burgers, we both opted for custom burgers, since this is what Burgatory is known for.  I had the crab burger on a pretzel bun with the cajun rub, grilled pineapple, truffled shallot aioli, tomato, and arugula.  While the crab patty was decent in flavor, it was quite soft, making it a bit awkward to eat on a burger.  The flavor of the grilled pineapple complemented it nicely, though the juice made the crab patty a bit soggy after biting into it.  While it wasn't a bad burger, I prefer the chicken burger I had last time due to its firmness.  My dining partner had the fifty-fifty burger, which comes out looking pink despite being well-done.  Since he chose the options, I don't remember all of them, but I know he got it on herbed focaccia and with field greens, cucumber, and onions.  He enjoyed his burger very much.Surprisingly, we were able to get seated without any wait whatsoever--a rarity at Burgatory.  I'm guessing this is because people don't realize that this branch is open yet, so enjoy it while you can.  Our service was excellent, with our waitress stopping to check on us at several points in the meal, which was probably a result of it not being super-crowded.  Needless to say, this new branch of Burgatory beats many of the mediocre North Shore eateries, so if you're in the neighborhood and are hungry, check it out!"Vegan Tuesday" ...At Burgatory?! That's right, Yelpers! The famous burger and milkshake joint offered a spicy black bean burger & pineapple coconut shake this past Tuesday. I expect that they will switch up the vegan burger and shake option every week or month. Unfortunately, the black bean burger was not gluten free, womp womp...Just when I thought I was out of luck, the waitress brought me the gluten free menu. They had gluten free AND vegan options on this special menu! What a delight! I decided to get the naked (no bun...even though they DO offer gluten free buns!) portobello mushroom with an onion dust, tomato, onion, cucumber, avocado, and a Sriracha glaze. Instead of chips, I got the Quinoa salad. There wasn't a description of the Quinoa salad on the menu so I didn't realize it came with feta cheese on top. Not a huge deal, it was easy to take off. The Quinoa salad was quinoa, peppers, onion and spices tossed in a light vinaigrette. Tasty side dish & a plentiful portion size. My favorite part of the meal was by far the onion dust on the portobello mushroom! Slightly crunchy on the outside and the flavor seeped through into the warm, soft middle of the shroom. I will get a dust on my portobello burger every time I'm there! I would have liked a few more avocado slices (a few thin slivers is never enough) and a spicier Sriracha glaze would have given the burger the perfect punch. I understand making the glaze mild for those patrons who have a weak tolerance for spicy food. We didn't have any issues with our waitress. She was friendly, attentive and made great suggestions about the food. She was quite good at up-selling, I'll give her that! The layout of the restaurant is standard Burgatory and what you'd expect. Clean and spacious- no complaints from our group! We'll be back!
Shawarma House=This area has been desperately in need of a good Mediterranean option, and Shawarma House fills the void- service is really friendly and genuine, menu has lots of options and great, low prices. Menu has several specials, like a whole rotisserie chicken meal with pita for under $9. The best option though, is their Sultani Plate, $20 and enough to share, with a little bit of everything on the menu. I'm pretty picky about shawarma, and the chicken version here was good but not great- what kicks it up a level is their garlic sauce. It seems to be sour-cream based which is a little unusual, but it packs plenty of garlic flavor! They also offer garlic fries as a side, though I have yet to try them. The kibbeh are solid, and so is the Armenian salad (do the +$2 to add feta).
Popeyes=Worst experience ever here. For a new place that just opened you would think they would've been more organized. When we pulled up to the drive thru I wasn't sure what I wanted so I told the guy to give us a minute. He then must've asked me five or six times what I wanted to order. Didn't I just say to give us a minute? So here is our exact order. 2 orders of the two piece dinner meal. One order with cole slaw and an extra side of Mac and cheese. Also wanted both of them to be legs. Both of them must be mild.  We pulled up to the window to pay and get our order. Didn't even get a thank you. When we got home the order was completely wrong. I didn't get two legs like I specified, they forgot my Mac and cheese, and our chicken was spicy. After 5-6 phone calls to the number that was on the receipt, and someone actually answering, they told us that they have new staff. They are only getting two stars from me because they would give us the same order for free. Note to staff, maybe you should check the order before actually giving it to your customer.
Braddah's Island Style=NEW OBSESSION ALERT! Braddah's Island Style blew me away! I had been reading the reviews of the other locations and Braddah's was definitely on my radar, but I never had a chance to make it in.I happened to be in the area and saw that a new location was opening somewhat near me and I felt like that lady in the annoying Mervyn's commercial back in the day... OPEN! OPEN! OPEN! So I kept checking back to see when it was going to open and low and behold, today I saw that it was and IT WAS ONNNNN!!!!!So I just tried their amazing food and I'm hooked! It was sooo good! It's fast casual style, a lot like Chipotle with the bowls, burritos, tacos or salads but with a way better vibe and food. The menu is a lot more creative with higher quality ingredients. Like seriously though. Soo OVER Chipotle. I had already been saying that anyway because their meat is so nasty. Tons of gristle. I'll never eat there again but thankfully I have an alternative. And a healthy alternative at that. So here's how it works:Step 1 - Choose One - Burrito, Bowl, Salad, Tacos or NachosStep 2 - Choose One - Huli Huli Chicken, Kalua Pig, Pulehu Steak, Grilled Fish, Grilled VeggiesStep 3 - Choose Any - Seaweed Rice or Brown Rice, Black Beans, Grilled Veggies ($1.25)Step 4 - Choose Any - Charred Pineapple Verde (Mild), Mango & Roasted Corn (Medium), Tomato with Grilled Maui Onions (Hot), Guacamole (Upcharge), Sour Cream, Cheese, Bean Sprouts, Lettuce, Purple Cabbage, Cilantro, Chopped Jalapeños or HabanerosThey also had some side sauces to choose from: Mango Habanero, Raspberry Jalapeño and Kiwi Jalapeño.I had the Steak Bowl (pictured) and in mine I got: Pulehu Steak, Seaweed Rice, Black Beans, Charred Pineapple Verde, Cheese, Jalapeños, Habanero, Cilantro, & Bean Sprouts with Mango Habanero sauce. Highly recommend. I ate every last grain of rice.They gave me a sample of their soon to be world famous Coconut Bark because I was a newb and WOW that stuff is fantastic! That salted caramel and chocolate with the coconut just melted in my mouth. It's won awards and I can see why.I am so happy! I'm going to be like their best regular now. I wish this place was closer to me though. That's the only thing that sucks. But it's close enough. I'm going to make the trek because it's worth it!Do yourself a favor and try the food here. It is soooooo friggin good, I can't even tell you.Shaka Braddah! See you guys tomorrow.First time visit disappointedBEWAREMy daughter ordered Huli HuliChicken tacos and found a BIG chicken bone in her food.Waited for other patrons to leave before I said anything.No sorry no concern no nothing!Luckily my daughter didn't choke on the 2" chicken bone.Asked who was responsible for cutting upChicken - they need to be more careful !All FIVE employees - said absolutely nothing.I'm taking my money elsewhere where they care.Well it's unfortunate that someone's safety and well being has to be taught to your "young leadership"! As well as their common sense and courtesy to at least acknowledge the issue; then show concern for your patron and at minimum an apology regarding the situation. NOT ONE of your staff whom varied in age offered an apology which leaves your patrons "the perception that there is no concern regardless of how long they have been in leadership".Obviously they learned from you as your lack of sincerity comes through your response.
Thai Bistro=I don't understand why this spot has a separate business listing: there is one counter inside of Jackie Bee Boba Tea. I guess the signage implies that the food and the tea are provided by separate businesses, but it's one space with one counter and staff provide service for both menus. Shrug.The location is across the street from a community college and next door to a computer gaming store, which helps to understand the target audience. I would compare the food quality to a step above a food court, with more variety than that description suggests. I've grabbed a few apps here and a $7 lunch combo before- it's Chinese/Thai fast food, with dishes like pad thai and orange chicken, and sides/apps like spam musubi, spring rolls, egg rolls, and of course, the boba.Service is quick and generally friendly. The shared dining area is clean with new furniture and games available. The parking lot is very small, so you may want to utilize the adjacent Dennys lot and walk over.
Pomo Pizzeria Gilbert=POMO = Apple?! Yes! Super short story: Back in the days the tomato was introduced to the Italians from the New World and was then used throughout their cooking. And since tomatoes have seeds in it, it is considered a fruit. The tomato is a fruit variation of an apple, hence pomo!  Hopefully I have captured and given the word Pomo its origin. If not, you are more than welcome to correct the story! :)Anyway, the wait was 45 minutes. Started at the bar area to order some drinks. The Peach Bellini is a good sweet bubbly! Misters and the fan were on to help cool off in the summer heat. Within less than the suggested 45 minute wait we were seated to our table. All the pizza prices were roughly around $16 or so for thin crust pizzas cooked in a wood fire oven. We went for the calamari appetizer with a few surprises of fried shrimp, a couple lemon wedges to squirt some acidity over the breaded seafood. Pizzas:Pomo - Italian sausage, roasted red bell peppers, sautéed onions and mushrooms over the pomodoro sauce and cheese. The crust was a bit on the chewy dry side. $15.95Donna Rosa - (no tomato sauce pizza). Thin crust, with pesto sauce, cherry tomatoes and shrimp. A bit on the very salty side but overall was my favorite pizza. Pizza crust was more edible here. Calabessas - (I think that's what it was called). Thin crust as well, with tomato sauce, fried eggplant and shaved parmegiano cheese (which I loved). What I didn't like was the literal 4 teeny tiny pieces of eggplant about 0.34 cubic cm!!! What the heck happened here? A shortage of eggplant stock at the restaurant??? Not cool. Beverages: Pomo Lemon Drop - pomo juice (some pomegranate juice), vodka citrus, lemon juice. A bit strong and sour. $9Peach Bellini - peach juice and champagne $8 I would have to say that the intentions of the pizza menu was there but the ingredients were not.  With a little more care into the pizzas this place would be great. Good ambience.I looked down at my pizza and the heat fogged up my glasses like some sort of nerd who saw something sexy.Just kidding. I had my contacts in but I did see a sexy pizza in front of me!I love Pomo's and with one being so close to home in Downtown Gilbert, nestled nicely in the Heritage Marketplace, I'm over the moon! Great ambiance; beautifully golden tiled, wood-fire, pizza oven where delicious pies are cooked; and a friendly staff! EJ was our waiter this afternoon and he was super friendly, charismatic, and those dimples! Phew!  Since we strolled in shortly after 1:30PM, and after the lunch rush, there was absolutely no wait time.  It was nice and clean, the A/C kept us chilled, and EJ kept the waters full and the food coming!  Here's what we had:Bruschetta Classica:  Homemade Pugliese bread, roma tomatoes, garlic, fresh basil, and evoo.  I love me some bruschetta mainly because I'm a carb-whore and love bread!  The bread was toasted to perfect crunchy-on-the-outside-and-chewy-in-the-middle median and the fresh tomatoes were delicious.  Splash on some of their house evoo infused with crushed chili flakes and I'm in Heaven.  It was the perfect antipasti!The Napoli:  Described as, " Imported Fillets of Anchovies, Basil, Sicilian Oregano," I was immensely pleased with how delicious this came out.  The thin crust was on the chewier side which I wasn't anticipating since it was baked in a 900°F wood-fire oven and was pretty flimsy.  There was a good amount of cheese-drag whenever I bit into the mozzarella and the smoky salty anchovy was delicious.  It was a delicious combination that made my skirt flip.The Pomo:  "Italian Sausage, Roasted Red Bell Pepper, Sauteed Onions, Sauteed Mushrooms."  While I only had a single slice of this bad boy, I gotta admit, I wasn't too impressed.  The crust held up better with The Pomo than The Napoli but it was kind of vanilla.  Eating this pizza, the one that's suppose to be "the house" and special, was kind of bland.  It needed a kick from some crushed peppers.  Good sauce ratio on this thin crust pizza.Crème brûlée:  We wrapped up the meal with a classic crème brûlée.  We were actually torn between the brûlée and tiramisu but I was offered the dessert I wanted.  How could I say no?  Perfect caramel crust and a smooth creamy custard.  It was a bit strong on the vanilla but I loved it!  The strawberry shaped as a rose looked pretty but I wish they cut it into slices so I could eat it with my brûlée.  Also, I'm never one to turn down a little whipped cream with my berries.  Just saying.All in all, Pomo is a great place for a pie.  They're actually ranked in the Top 10 pizza places in town!  So give it a try!
Corkbuzz Charlotte=Had the opportunity to try Corkbuzz during a friends and family event - what a fun experience!The decor and vibe inside is sophisticated, yet warm. Lots of seating options, including small tables and a private room. There is a 2000 bottle wine room that will look tremendous when fully stocked!Service was gracious and knowledgable - our service person made great food suggestions, the manager chatted with us about pairings and we even had a chance to speak with Laura, the owner! Everyone was attentive, even though it was busy.Food-wise, we had a couple of the starters - warm olives, and house made ricotta, along with the chicken-fried rabbit. All three were solid, but the ricotta is addictive! The chicken-fried rabbit was an unusual twist on a southern dish, and the warm gravy will be great when it's cooler outside!The wine selection looks tremendous and paired with the food and attentive service I suspect Corkbuzz will be a hotspot in South Charlotte!
Hanabi=I'm happy to say that there is new sushi bar in town which has a great all you can eat option. Luckily we were passing by on their first day of business so we decided to give it a try! I was originally just looking for some appetizers to snack on but the all you can eat dinner for 28.00 seemed pretty reasonable so I went with the all you can eat. I started with the Kobe beef sushi roll. It had Kobe beef, avocado and a sweet type of sauce drizzled on the top. It was delicious! The crispy buffalo shrimp was tangy . They were bite sized shrimp with buffalo flavoring. The 007 was like a California roll but with big pieces of shrimp and avocado draped over the rolls. I enjoyed these as well!Bacon and scallop skewers were mostly bacon with tiny pieces of scallops inside. They had different skewers available . I would like to try the bacon and mushroom skewers next time. Chicken Katsu wraps were good especially for people like my husband who don't eat sushi. He was happy with the wrap and his cucumber salad .We ended the meal with some honey toast. It reminded me of hawaiian rolls with ice cream and honey on the top. It  was my first time having this dessert be prepared for sweetness overload!I liked the variety on the menu and that there wasn't a lot that was left out of the all you can eat. Except for the sashimi but it was okay with me because I don't eat sashimi. I thought the picnic type of chairs were cute and comfortable. The service was on point and I can't wait to go back. My husband even found something he would like to try on our next visit!Let's be honest, everyone in this town is a sushi expert.There are just a couple of rules you are going to have to follow if you want to roll out a new AYCE sushi bar in Las Vegas:1 - Keep your prices competitive ($3+ more than everywhere else? Why?)2 - Keep your fish fresh (if you cant sell it before it starts to turn, don't try to pass it on to unsuspecting customers)3 - Don;t be cheap (buy sushi quality fish - believe me, we can tell the difference)3 - Offer what everyone else does (if you wont serve me sashimi with AYCE, why should I come here?)4 - Don't skimp on portions (look, stop being cheap, your fish is going rank, use it before it goes)I will say it not the worst place I have tried in Vegas, but if I am paying piece meal instead of going AYCE, I expect you not to give my tiny little sliver of fish.I'll be honest, the salmon tasted like crap. Sushi grade salmon doesn't taste like the cheap, color added, farmed raised crap you buy at Vons.We are all sushi experts in this town - if you want to succeed, respect that.Great AYCE deal! Fish is fresh, dishes are fun, service at the bar was attentive. As other reviews state, the AYCE dinner price is $28, which is slightly higher than the local average. However, quality here is among the best AYCE I've had and the majority of lower-priced businesses in town have significantly lower quality to match.APPETIZERS: This was our favorite section of the menu. The Jalapeno Popper dish that is commonly found around town was nicely presented here and actually had a good kick of spice for once! Salmon poke had a great spicy chili sauce, both were offset by the seaweed salad. We really enjoyed the grilled mackerel and the soft shell crab, but I did not care for the oysters. The real standout was the Rock N Roll appetizer, which is a riceless roll! NIGIRI: Nigiri selection was ample, and fish was typically pretty fresh. The super white tuna, scallop, golden eel, and squid were good options, but I felt the salmon and yellowtail weren't that great and lacked flavor. Rice was an average portion, fish was cut on the thin side.ROLLS: We tried the Twilight roll and the White Dragon roll, both had several sauces and fishes, both were tempura-shrimp based. I generally try to be more adventurous with my roll picks but by this point I was too full to care. Rolls were solid and they had a lot of new specialty options, but I wish they had more riceless options.The space was another sushi spot before Hanabi took over, but the modern, clean décor and chalkboard specials menu are a bit different. Service at the bar was attentive and we were frequently checked on by both chefs and management, though our empty dishes stacked up- this didn't really bother me, as they were pretty busy.For those who are outraged by the higher AYCE price here- if $3 is really a deal breaker for you to drop your rating over, you have no business coming here. Stick to the Dollar Menu. The quality of dishes, freshness of fishes, and variety on the menu are more than enough to warrant the difference in cost.TIP: Follow them on social media for a 50% off coupon for November & December for a la carte orders (good lunch option).Another decent AYCE spot. This one takes over the space formerly occupied by 808 Tapas. Hanabi has a fairly large menu with some items only available a la carte. Nigiri is the way to go here. The quality is pretty good for an AYCE place. Rolls on the other hand weren't my favorite. Some, like the yellowtail special with cooked shrimp, jalapeño, cilantro, cucumber topped with yellowtail, ponzu, habanero, were too hot for my tastes. The Tiger roll (shrimp tempura, crab topped with spicy tuna with eel sauce) was the best of the bunch, the Mad Caterpillar (fresh water eel and cucumber topped with spicy tuna, spicy eel sauce) was decent, and the Crispy tuna scallion was not good with tuna that looked and tasted liked canned tuna. As a whole, the rolls seemed hastily crafted and lacked the precision of superior rolls found elsewhere.2.5 Stars
Texas de Brazil=Before my favorite churrascaria opened, I used to go here. Although it's cheaper here and they're open for lunch everyday and they have goat cheese at the salad bar, the service and food quality is marginal. They have the usual Brazilian BBQ salad bar items such as smoked salmon, lettuce, tomatoes, mushrooms, asparagus, cheeses, olives, salami, beans and rice etc. They give you pao de queijo, fried bananas and mashed potatoes. The meats include chicken, beef, pork, sausage and lamb. I've tried their Key Lime pie, cheesecake, flan and chocolate mousse all of which were just ok.The gaucho guys seem to take longer going around and when I come to a churrascaria, I come famished...waiting cannot happen. They seem careless too. I'd have blood/ oil/ meat juice drip next to my plate or my arm! Obrigadinha!Out of the churrascaria's in Vegas. FdC on Flamingo is #1 on my list, TdB is #2, VB in Summerlin is #3...and that P place in Planet Hollywood? Forget it!Took my dad for his birthday here since he's never been and since he's a major carnivore; definitely had to put my vegetarian on the side today for my dad lol. Located in the Town Square shopping center and across from Look Style Society, very easy to get to and has it's own parking spot.There was a bit of a wait, not too long, about 20 minutes on Friday, Labor Day Weekend so that's pretty good. But I made reservations earlier for 8pm, which I think is the best way to go.Came here for Dinner at $49.99/person which included unlimited salad bar and unlimited meats! The salad bar had tons of options! My favorites were the Lobster Bisque of course, and the Potatoes Gratin. I also saw a variety of cheeses, deli meats, curried cauliflower, all types of salads with quinoa, beans, and your typical toppings with romaine lettuce, grilled veggies, mushrooms, smoked salmon, shrimp, breads, etc. Pretty amazing but don't get too filled up on all of that since at your table you get unlimited meats coming around!If you've never been here, they have little coasters on the table, one per person, with one side green and one side red. If you want meat, you flip it to the green side, and if you need a little break or if you've decided to throw in the towel, you flip it to the red side! When it's green, they have servers that walk by your table, each with a large skewers of a different style of meat and you tell them how many pieces your want! The options from what I can remember were Filet Mignon, Top Sirloin (The infamous Picanha- the FAVE at our table), Lambs Chop, Parmesan Pork/Chicken, Bacon wrapped Filet, Pork Ribs, Flank Steak, and Brazilian Sausage! Phew! Tons of meat options!Then if you're still not full, or if you suddenly get a second stomach like me right when dessert comes, they have a lot of great options as well! Brazilian Cheesecake, Crème Brûlée, Brazilian Flan, Chocolate Mousse Cake, Bananas Foster Pie, Key Lime Pie, Carrot Cake, Pecan Pie, Brazilian Papaya Cream, and Coconut Pie. They brought the dessert tray out and I wanted to try basically everything especially the Crème Brûlée, Flan, and Papaya Cream but decided to go with the Carrot since it's my dad's favorite. So this carrot cake is pretty amazing. It doesn't have raisins in it and it has a coconut element to it so just that makes it an A in my book but on top of that it was super fluffy and moist and wasn't too sweet. I mean it was sweet definitely but it wasn't that artificial, loaded with powdered sugar type of sweetness. Perfect way to end the meal! Even though I don't eat meat often nowadays, on meat days, this is a definite contender especially if it's a special occasion. Yum! I'll be back! (In Arnold voice lmao) :)Went to Texas de Brazil for dinner this past Saturday night 10/10th @ 9:30pm for a fantastic 2 hour dinner. Really late to be feasting as a carnivore so late at night, but the only other available reservation time was at 7pm. Given the fact I made the phone call at 6:56pm, those 4 minutes was kinda untimely; so we ate late into the night.This Brazilian steakhouse was half filled with patrons when we arrived. Immediately greeted by a very friendly hostess, who sat us at a nice table for 2, staged among a classy and romantic ambiance; close to the salad bar.The lobster bisque was outstanding! Plenty of gourmet cold and hot salad bar food selections to savor.Our server Hanna, from Rio, was excellent! She coordinated with a few other servers offering us plenty of mouth watering tasty Brazilian meat selections, all hand carved tableside, with impeccable service. Our bottle of fine red wine was delicious & intoxicating, yet overpriced; but what fine dining restaurant doesn't mark it up 300%?! Surprised we were offered desserts considering we were the last couple in the restaurant and everybody probably wanted to go home. But we agreed we were stuffed with no room for dessert! However, the dessert selection our server Hanna presented to us at our table looked absolutely amazing.Overall, Texas de Brazil was an outstanding fine dining experience that I would gladly return to; at an earlier dinner hour. Reservations recommended in advance. No pictures taken. Go see for yourself :-)YELP 250 CHALLENGE 2015: #232
Crêpe Station=My coworkers were talking about crepes, places to get crepes, and about a really popular crepe place that sold their crepes from their house and advertise through the Mexican "Craigslist" got popular and opened up a real brick & mortar store. Typical water cooler chitchat with our delivery truck driver when he stops in for order pick up.That got me interested. At first they told me it was on E. Charleston. But I later found out after another coworker said it was closer to W. Charleston and Decatur. I was thinking how come I never heard about this place, I used to only lived a few streets away.So after a mandated doctor's office visit about a mile or two away, I decided to give Crêpe Station a try. I nearly missed the small strip mall it was located on due to alerts that popped up on my phone, plus a lane was closed on Charleston due to who knows what. But with the slow moving traffic, I was able to turn into the plaza it was located in.The place it turns out has only been opened about 2 weeks. But the owners did have several months to perfect their recipes & techniques while operating out of their underground home operation. Hundreds, if not thousands, of satisfied Mexicans can't be wrong :) And I am really glad to learn about this place through words of mouth networking.Their menu is simple and organized logically. You have your sweet crêpes, your savory crêpes, paninis, beverages (coffees, smoothies). For first timers, ordering is not as stressful as trying to narrow down your option to just one from a 400+ items Chinese takeout menu.I wanted to try their Red Velvet dessert crêpe, but ultimately picked the Chicken Pesto Crêpe (it was around noon and I have not have had lunch yet). The young kids behind the counter were nice and took the order and had it prepared and delivered it to my table after a nominal wait.The included side salad looks better than most side salads you get at 95% of the restaurants out there. It has some sliced strawberries and mangos on top of mixed mesclun greens, with a light balsamic dressing. The Chicken Pesto Crêpe looks good, the presentation is nicely conceptualized & executed, the crepe was cooked just perfectly. I was happy with my selection and the price tag. Service was pleasant and efficient too.Would I go back and try some more of their items from their simple menu?  Yes, of course. I'll be back. Probably next Thursday after another scheduled visit back to the medical specialist.  No, it's not a tomb-er!  (I hope you sound like Arnold Schwarzenegger in your head as you read that).Both Yelp and the door say they open at 9am.  The girl opening up today did not arrive until 9:05 to open the door and then spent 10 minutes setting everything up before even acknowledging me in the store.  One customer left because she was not ready to start business for the day.When she was finally ready she was very short and rude acting like I was bothering here.  Another worker showed up around 9:10, never said a word just started helping her open.If you want repeat customers, employees should be ready and be a little more polite to customers.As for the food, the coffee was good. A Carmel Macchiato.  I also ordered a veggie crepe which is just tomatoes, pesto, mozzarella and basil.The crepe itself had no taste, if not for the inside it would have been bland.  I would rate the food 3 stars, and maybe even given an overall 4 stars if not for the lack of customer service and customer interaction.Teaching moment:  things happen, if you are running behind, still greet the customer with a smile, have some fun with the fact you are running late and let the customer know it will be a minute.  That goes a long way versus acting like we are bothering you.
Ocotillo=Wow, there's a new kid on the block, but not all that is new means good, I almost am in shock at my experience when compared to other reviews and opinions I've read so far.Maybe it's just Sunday's. The Sunday morning service was laughable at best, laugh because I didn't want to cry. I wasn't certain how they handle call aheads, or reservations, it was also a weekend brunch, so I attempted to call ahead to at least ask what the wait looked like. Two calls later and no answer, we were already there and parking, but upon entering the compound that is Ocotillo, I found the lady at the maitre d stand, with a phone just below her left elbow. (Seriously?)I inquired as to the wait as I put the name in with her and was told just a few minutes, tables were being cleaned now. I guess "being cleaned" meant 30 minutes, I must have forgotten my English to English translator, silly me. I was unpleasantly surprised to find 6 or 7 open tables as I was getting seated, and the wait had stacked what appeared to be 4 more parties behind me. At this point my best guess was that there weren't enough staff for a weekend morning to handle guests demands. I ordered the roast beef and potatoes hash, which came with a sunnyside egg, and after requesting the egg medium, the egg was way undercooked; about 3 minutes under. I tried the roast beef, which was chunks of tough beef, overly chewy and super fatty and the potatoes were large cubes about 1.5inch by 1.5inch, this was not a hash. I had about two bites before deciding to give it back to the server. As I returned the hash, the server replied with a friendly, can I get you something else in stead, which was kind of her, trying to appease my dislike with a different dish, was helpful on her part but I was short on time and wasn't interested in something else at that point.The rest of my party all independently came to the conclusion that their meals weren't so amazing as to spend the $$ they're charging here, and the wait was over the top. One of the people in the party tried to order the breakfast chimichanga, which they were out of. Their second choice; scrambled farm eggs, was quite underwhelming. Our party also ordered the bread pudding bowl, which was neither bread pudding, nor was it in a bowl. It was tasty though, and had they called it loaf of gooey cinnamon bread on top of roasted apples with cream, it would have been spot on.Being as objective as possible after such a poor experience, the server was friendly and tried to resolve my complaint by allowing me to order a different meal and the bread pudding bowl tasted good, but caveat emptor to the person who orders it expecting bread pudding.I can't say that I'll be back soon, but they do have a to go coffee bar, so if you drink coffee maybe you can grab and go from there on your way to work.Happy yelping!Fab "new" spot located in Central Phoenix. It does a great job of delivering delicious New American food and providing an open and industrial/modern space. The spot contains a restaurant, cafe and tons of open space like a beer garden, bar and patio.For the restaurant (menu wise), they serve lunch and dinner. However, they only serve brunch on the weekends. I came here for lunch with Stacy M to get a little taste of what Ocotillo had to offer and was pleasantly surprised. We ordered their Iced Coffee Boba, filled Dates, Cabbage Salad and a Egg White Breakfast Burrito to share and it was more than enough.Iced Coffee Boba: I would pass on this as the coffee tastes like any typical iced coffee you can get, however the boba was overly done and mushy instead of having the chewy, bouncy texture it should have.Dates: dates filled with ricotta and topped with almonds and blackberries, this appetizer is deliciously simple and perfect for sharing. No judgement if you don't want to, it's perfectly acceptable because they are that good!Cabbage Salad: this salad is fresh, light and comes is a more than generous portion. It has shaved cabbage, carrot and comes with a lovely tea dressing that adds a tart and fragrant flavor to the salad.The Egg white burrito: was probably the best egg white anything I've ever had, it was so flavorful and clean. This entree surprised me the most. Filling, clean tasting but nothing short of flavorful from the ingredients and house salsa that's served with it.The cafe is the only cafe in Phoenix that serves Sightglass coffee and has a good arrangement of drinks, snacks and pastries. Although separate from the rest of the restaurant, this area is quiet and perfect for solo coffee/tea drinkers. I've had their Autumn Latte, breakfast burrito (egg and bacon) as well as their Nutella Croissant and it was all so delicious. They definitely take typically made items and add their own twist which is truly refreshing. The price is also a lot cheaper than most other cafes I frequent, which is a definite plus!The staff here can be a bit slow, but they are all so friendly and easy to talk to. They truly make you feel welcomed and show their appreciation. They are also really receptive to any questions or concerns you may have. Definitely a place to check out!
HopCat=Crack fries: aptly named. Beer selection: ridiculous. Burgers: gigantic and tasty. Staff: exceptionally attentive (especially since it was the first day). To be honest I went in expecting to be let down because it seems like the kind of thing I would hate, but they seem to have figured out a really solid recipe for making this behemoth establishment something interesting and worthy of return visits. I was especially impressed with the service as our waiter was super friendly, knowledgable, and on top of everything. I'm also excited for their killer happy hour specials (half off burgers and $3 taps!) and their giant Bloody Mary bar on Sundays. The real test will be seeing what the atmosphere is like when the students return as that will really make or break a place like this for me and my friends.Okay, HopCat, color me impressed. HopCat you can be my best Madison beer friend with extra benefits. You promised so much, and I was left skeptical. Your offerings were written like a profile on eHarmony. Everyone lies on those a little bit so I assumed not everything you said could be true! HopCat lives up to the hype that has been blasting throughout Madison social media. If you love beer, this bar is THE place in Madison for you to check out.I didn't even on plan on stepping in on your grand opening, but it just happened to work out. I had a friend from out of town visiting, and we were hanging out at the Capitol. We decided 3:00 would be a good time for a brew so we stopped by HopCat to give the new place a shot.When we walked it, it was completely packed. I was quite interested in trying out the new beer house in town so I was willing to wait the 30 minutes that was apparently needed for a table because they were so slammed. Well, the table only took about 5 minutes so I'm not going to complain there!When you first walk in, you are going to notice the massive floor plan and giant bar on the ground floor, as well as, the giant staircase that leads up to more of this giant beer house. The second floor is about half the size of the first, maybe a little smaller. The bar is significantly smaller than the one downstairs. The main bar has 130 beers on tap from around the country and many more in bottles from around the world. The upstairs bar has 30 local beers on tap. My tip, if you're impatient is to order local beers if you're seated upstairs. If you like trying new things like me, you won't mind the slightly longer wait for a beer to be transported from downstairs.Did I mention that there are 130 beers on tap? Well, there are, and I am truly impressed by the diverse, well organized beer list that has been assembled. The list even includes a key that educates the customer about glass type and size. I truly did not feel overwhelmed, despite the number of beers, because the list was well curated. MEGA props for pulling this off. I have felt overwhelmed with much smaller lists. The tap list was also dated so it appears that the list will be rotating frequently. I am happy to see this, although I doubt I will wear the current list out any time soon.We were served two orders of "crack" fries with our beers. They were both free for the grand opening, but I'm glad that we got to try them because I'm not sure if I would have randomly ordered these. They were very good WITH the cheese sauce that the fries came with. The fries alone were slightly overpowering on the seasoning. There was A LOT of pepper and salt on them, but the cheese balanced out the seasoning. I would have liked to see a little more garlic and less pepper/salt to mellow the spices out a tad.Our server was quite attentive. I jumped the gun a little bit by asking another server for waters because we hadn't received any. Our server came back with a 2nd set of waters as soon as he returned (oops). I am just assuming that they were so slammed this afternoon that he had a lot to juggle.The atmosphere feels very trendy, and I appreciate the classic rock images plastered all over the walls. It's a little loud but not unbearably so for this type of establishment. I could still hear my friend at the table. The awesome classic rock mix playing over the sound system was greatly appreciated.The management encourage that you carve into the table with whatever knife or other sharp object you brought with you. Do not assume the people before you are rude. Table carving is HopCat's trendy thing. Add a note!HopCat, you're a CoolCat, and I would like to bring more of my friends over to try out what you're offering. I can see myself staking out a table for many hours to poke around your beer list some more. As a beer & wine drinker, I truly appreciate what the well curated list that you are offering this community. There is beer and mediocre tap selections everywhere in Madison, but I think I finally found a place that the proud beer lovers of Madison can call their home.Keep up the good work. I'm honestly unsure how you made such a beer behemoth run smoothly. You are the Mussolini of beer (he made the trains run on time). Let's hang out again sometime soon!The newest hottest joint in Madison. It is where all the cool kids are going. A few things to remember before you step into the vortex of beer and crack fries. * No one under 21 unless accompanied by a guardian.* No one under 21 after 10:00 PM. * Come hungry and thirsty. Now lets get rolling. You walk through the door to be greeted by an array of friendly staff, have your I.D. ready. Once you get your table prepare to read. The beer list is extensive.* 30 beers on tap from Wisconsin that don't change* 100 rotating beers on tapThe food. I just cant get past the crack fries.~ Vladimir Poutine: Crack fries with potato and cheese pierogi, cheese curds, stout caramelized onions and cherry smoked bacon smothered in sour creme gravy.~ Buffalo Rolls: Simple and delicious. Tender chicken coated in house made buffalo sauce wrapped in wantons. It was crunchy on the outside yet the inside layer of the wanton had a nice chewy texture to it ~ Wings: I am an avid supporter of wings. I just feel like it is one appetizer that does not get enough credit. These wings were tossed with an apple BBQ sauce. Not a lot of spice but some darn good flavor. The meat lulled right off the bone with little resistance. Definitely a must try app.  The rest of the food looks amazing so I guess more trips and more pictures are in order. The atmosphere is laid back and fun. Get to know your server and you will have a great time. Too many times a place opens and they have to weed out the bad staff. This establishment seems to have done that before opening their doors as I received a smile and hello from every employee that walked by.  One last note.  Ask for Allen as your server. He's one of the great ones.I have this thing about overhyped places...I lose interest. So even though I initially was looking forward to HopCat...HypeCat... opening, I decided to wait until the masses were on to the next new thing. When I found myself downtown today, I popped in to check it out. What the heck...? Ok. So this place does everything right. Ambiance? Clean, well decorated and the perfect lighting and music levels (and every single song played was a favorite, during my entire visit). A singing waiter, who sang the whole time I was there (and thankfully in a good voice) is a clue that the staff enjoys being there. That sounds like it could be annoying, but it really wasn't. The downstairs bar is a huge U-shaped affair, and there was only one bartender working when I stopped in, but he handled everything well on his own. Calm, friendly, knowledgeable, and just attentive enough. Adam is a pro. I inquired about half pours of beers, and that indeed was an option. I tried two beers that were new to me, one of which Adam recommended, and it was much better than the one I picked on my own. Both were very good, though.I had intended to only grab an order of the much-lauded crack fries for lunch, but then Adam informed me that all the tempting-sounding burgers were half price. I'm not sure what the hours or days of that special are, but I was there around 3:30 pm on a Thursday. I rarely ever order burgers, but I'd been in the mood for an old favorite, a blue cheese and mushroom burger. When I saw that was one of their special burgers, I couldn't resist. I'm gonna tell you guys, it was fantastic. It came with lettuce, tomato, swiss, and shoestring fried onions in addition to the mushrooms and blue cheese mayo. It was cooked exactly medium, just as ordered. It was a bit of a mess to eat, but they bring you plenty of napkins when it's delivered to your table. Or the bar, as it were. As I were...sitting at the bar. Crack fries are all they are hyped to be. Addictive. Everything was all I could want it to be. Corporate entity, yes, but you kind of forget all that once you fall under their spell of perfectly executed everything.Two half pour-beers and a huge platter of delicious food came to twelve dollars and change. Amazing. I am a fan for life.
Estrellón=Well worth the wait!  Estrellon is finally open for business and serving up some amazing cuisine.  The restaurant itself was gorgeous.  Stunning woodwork, fabulous tables, and we loved the view into the open kitchen!  The bar area is completely separate from the restaurant and the perfect spot for after work, pre-show at the Overture, or after dinner drinks.  The tapas bar is in the bar area as well which is fabulous to sit and watch and drool over their wares.The drinks were delicately hand crafted.  We had the Herbs and the Bees (a blend of gin, yellow chartreuse, lavender honey) and the Monk Melon.  My Tempranillo by the glass was the perfect complement to the food as well.Most importantly, the food!!  First, if you have any questions on the menu, don't hesitate to ask your server...they perfectly explained anything we threw at them! Prepare to order a lot of plates due to smaller portions, but it's a blast to try so many different things!  Pan con Tomate was a great easy starter (fresh crushed tomatoes on toasted bread), the heirloom tomatoes were the most amazing fresh local tomatoes prepared simply with EVOO and a dusting of delicious flavors, the charred beets are served atop a crisped baguette, and the mortadella was as excellent as you'd expect from a Spanish restaurant.  We absolutely loved the seared padron peppers that were sprinkled with sea salt and the dragon tongue beans were out of this world....they are beans I know, but trust me, you need to order them along with the patatas bravas (aoli and red sauce topped frites).  We also had the brisket with chimichurri (don't think of this as a southern BBQ brisket) and the seared scallop with the most amazing fresh corn relish.The night ended on an amazing high note with dessert.  When our server recited the dessert menu, our table of 5 said yes....we want them ALL!  Best decision we made all night!  Out of this world was the basque cake served with seasonal berries (it's a delicious almond base cake that is perfectly crunchy on the outside while moist and creamy on the inside), their take on a crème brulee, sorbet with fresh berries and, of course, churros served with the most insane drinking chocolate (perfect for dunking!). We are already planning our return visit for the paella, which looked outstanding at a neighboring table!  Cheers to Tory Miller and his dedicated team for another unique and outstanding addition to Madison!If a restaurant can or could be rated on serving staff alone, then Estrellón would get five stars.Let's begin with the highlights; not the least of which was that we had quite a few staff running out at random points helping us try a few things that fun and fresh such as a few oysters on the shell with specially prepared relish.  Delicious!I follow Tory Miller's restaurants with glee (L'Etoile), and I delight in the chance to see what he was creating in the brand new renovated Ovation building (if you're going to build next to the historical Fire Station 1 on the back, let's be classy).  The staff that he chose for the new place was top-notch.  Our server was absolutely the highlight of the night, and I believe we were one of the first tables of the evening, as well as the restaurant.  Again, if kindness and good service were food enough to serve guests, I would recommend never eating anywhere else.  There are two menus at Estrellón.  One is the actual "Tapas" menu, the other is "La Cena," more of a "dinner" portion menu.  It's left a little ambiguous (notably on purpose), but essentially it's very different from most true Spanish tapas places.  The "tapas" menu is a very very much single serve (at $5+ an item), and the true shareable items are $10+.  This isn't to say that most everything wasn't absolutely delicious.  However, I do wonder, out of a tapas menu, how our table ordered more than half the tapas items to the tune of at least $150 for that portion (around $250 for the meal) and most every single item was brought out on a crostini.  Some items worked, and some very much did not (skipjack tuna with mayo just makes a tuna sandwich).When the table ordered what felt like eight/nine items and a single plate was brought out that had just a few bites, we felt as if we'd missed something. One might say, "well, you just don't understand tapas!"  Actually, we do.  Tapas, in Spain, is a round of drinks and a side dish. Order another, get another dish.  Should one desire a real hearty dish, you order one; at that point it's no longer free because you respect the chef and must now pay for the talents that you admire. Also drinks make one hungrier, cycle continuing.We scoff very much at free in the US, but tapas encourages discussion about the chef and his or her talents. Surely, prices could be adjusted to allow two bites?  Or the same ingredients on two crostini?  Some of the ingredients were piled so high that they immediately toppled over upon arrival; another piece of bread to allow more than one person to try would help.  That (if not free food) would have said to me that this restaurant understood the heart and soul of tapas: drinks and sharing.Tapas that is one item per person that does not allow sharing, individual portion (and a menu for single items, one bite each) flies in the face of everything that is the heart at soul of the cuisine.So thus, we had the "Cena" menu, but why is it different?  This was the menu that was meant to be shared, but then we had the Tapas menu?  I was not sure what the idea was behind this new way. I was there for tapas (shared portion meals), and it seemed to me that we had a very long "amuse bouche" menu that per portion would cause most parties to mistakenly blow through a dinner budget before ever getting to the real "tapas."My confusion aside, the drink selections were wonderful, and the wine list was phenomenal, but this isn't unusual.  Our party was not filled with wine drinkers, and we mocked ourselves a bit for that. Again, this is going to make some people feel not at home.  Sadly, the beer taps were out - but they do have a tap list that I hear is coming soon.  We look forward to returning for that.My crowning sadness of the evening, and the removal of one last star for me was the Paella.I have a special fondness for Valencian paella, and there would be a special cultural shock for a Spanish person; Valencian traditional paella is not seafood paella. Valencia does in fact have seafood paella, but the two are never mixed. Estrellón's version is made with the traditional Bomba rice and was very aromatic, but when I ordered the paella for two (at $45 a plate), I was hoping to see the happy sight of a giant steaming paellara. While I did read the description beforehand and knew it would be mixed, I was not expecting to see the smallest paellara in the world filled with very little come out to the table. It was very overcooked (paella is supposed to rest for 10 minutes, but not be dry and cool). The purposefully burned 'socarrat' at the bottom was black, when it should be toasty brown.Estrellón left me with many questions as to what it wants to accomplish and that brought my rating down.  I had a decent meal, but it came at the expense of having no food fun with my group - and it didn't feel at all like tapas, it felt like a string of appetizers that I couldn't share.I came for Tapas, but I'm not sure that's what I received.I could not be more disappointed with Estrellón. If you enjoy paying $1 per shishito pepper or $.50 per white bean, then this is your place.Besides the absurdity of menu prices (come full, don't eat, leave almost as full because WTF), the food can consider itself mediocre at best. It's not at all in league with similarly priced places in Madison (especially those places that charge this ridiculous amount for nearly no food on a plate WHICH IS NONE) and not worth your time. Please. Not. Worth. Your. Time.We literally laughed as the plates came to our table. Decor could be considered "fancy joke hahah."It was also nice when we were trying to be sold on the most expensive glass of wine in the restaurant that our waitress wouldn't even tell us about.
Big Beef Noodle=NOTE: Yelp has two listings for this business but even after submitting edits, will not remove or merge them. The other page is under Jin Jin You Wei. Not sure what the deal is, or if that's just a translation. Former space occupied by Island Malaysian #2, in the same building as Ichiza.Now that that's out of the way...Went in to grab takeout, was the only customer for dinner at 7PM on a weekday. Small order took literally half an hour to come out and the food was mediocre.Ordered the steamed dumplings and lamb pancake. Dumplings were mushy, overcooked, and bland. Taste and appearance were identical to what you'd get frozen in a bag at the grocery store and boiling yourself. Pancake contained a small portion of flavorful lamb- too bad it was overshadowed by all the grease. Opened the takeout box to a puddle of oil. picked up the pancake and had it all over my hands, bit in and got a mouthful of it too. Gross!Service was dismal at best. As the only customer, the wait time was unacceptable and no excuse or apology was given. I found it frustrating that the dumplings only come 10/order and cannot be mixed and matched with other flavors or styles. I thought it was a reasonable request, and possibly one they should consider in light of their lack of customers as a new business. Server barely spoke to me, not even when dropping off or picking up my bill.
Island Flavor =I don't get why this place has a 4.5 average rating. I JUST finished eating (what I managed to eat) and after 1 short rib, I was over it. Look at all my pictures, and you'll see what I'm talking about. Short ribs: waaaaaaay too much fat. After eating just 1 short rib, I had a big pile of fat sitting on a napkin. And nibbling on the bones is usually my favorite part about short ribs. I couldn't do it with these because I refuse to eat pure fat.Furikake chicken: the majority of the serving was the crumbs/breading. There were only a few big pieces of chicken. Korean short ribs: mushy and all breading. Don't get me wrong, the flavoring of the short ribs and furikake chicken were good, but the execution was a huge disappointment. Sometimes trying new places isn't always a good thing.Big flavor. Big portions. Head to Island Flavor Express!People who lived in Hawaii are blessed that Vegas is the 9th island. You don't have to go far to get some Island grinds. The newest addition to Henderson is located in the shopping area on Eastern Ave & Pebble. Same owners as Island Flavor on Durango, they are a casual place-order/pick-up order or take-out service style restaurant. The staff has been incredibly friendly on each visit and the place is clean and simple, with about 6 tables inside. Food I've ordered:Furikake Ahi PokeHawaiian-Style PokeKalbi RibsFurikake Chicken & ShrimpFurikake Chicken - Let's cut to the chase. I don't even eat chicken. The batter and glaze they use is insane, I couldn't help but try a few pieces that were just crumb batter. OMG. Sweet and salty deliciousness! My boyfriend and toddler loved it, too. I tried the shrimp version, and they over-fried it, so I wasn't as happy with it. Poke - The portion they give are great. The fish is cubed into good sizes. However, I can't say it's the best I've had. The fish tastes good, but I prefer the poke to have been marinated longer. Melt-in-your-mouth kind of poke...Kalbi - Ridiculous portion and the meat is tender! Look at the posted pictures below.Desserts - They have a rotating selection found in the fridge by the door, so you can self-serve and take it to the counter. I have yet to try any, but I've seen Chantilly, Haupia, Guava Chiffon, and Coco Puffs. They also stock Hawaiian Sun canned drinks.Look at their chalkboard for their daily specials. They serve Lau Lau on Fridays and I've seen Mahi Mahi and Kalua Pig posted, too.This has become one of those regular stops I'll make when I want some quick but tasty Hawaiian eats for the family. I'd love it if they could start serving oxtail soup and malasadas! That's the only thing I can say they are missing. But I'd highly recommend stopping by if you're hungry in Hendertucky!I expected a really mindblowing experience after all the hype around the original location and the positive comparisons drawn between the two, but the Eastern outpost of this restaurant lands merely in the "really good" category.Island Flavor Express is in the Regal Colonnade plaza on Eastern and Pebble, and it's very clearly a Hawaiian restaurant given all the depictions of the islands, reggae/ska music, and typical plate lunch menu options. They also offer varying specials and some desserts, although the desserts seemed to have run out in the waning evening hours. The decor is very simple but doesn't detract from the experience. Make sure to walk to the far end of the counter to place an order, but feel free to sit down if you're not taking it to-go. They'll bring the food out to your counter (or table, if you've picked the one table).I ordered the mixed plate ($11.25) with Furikake Chicken and Kalbi Short Ribs (+$1.00 for this particular meat). It's presented in a foam to-go box even if you're dining in. My favorite part was actually the macaroni salad, which was salted in a good way, and as creamy as you'd expect. The chicken was kinda like the "KFC" at Gen Korean BBQ in a not-so-good way. It has more of a dry, stringy texture than a moist, natural chicken texture, and the furikake didn't stand out as much as the sweet glaze did. Sriracha saved the day though, bestowing a little extra sweetness along with much-needed acidity and heat. I don't like having to add a condiment to make something stand out, but I'm very glad that I had the option.As for the other parts of the dish, the white rice is cooked perfectly, and the kalbi is a great rendition with tender beef, a nice touch of ginger, and some charring. It's a little on the fatty side, but let's remember that fat = flavor, which was proven in this case. Actually, it has muted sweetness when you eat it after something as sweet as the Furikake Chicken, but I was able to taste the full flavor when I dove into my my leftovers. If I get a mixed plate again with kalbi, I'll probably have to go for something like a pork dish that's not so sweet.My friend shared a spam musubi ($2) with me. It was a nice-sized portion, but the rice ratio was a bit high for me. Also, the seaweed was a little too mushy, which my friend pointed out may be a side-effect of the heat lamp. Although there are interesting seasonings and herbs in Island Flavor's version, I prefer the Ross J's rendition, which I'm sure is prepped to order.I also tried my friend's oxtail soup ($10), which actually comes in a real bowl if you're dining in. Unfortunately, I can't compare it to the renowned Hawaiian oxtail soup at that one hotel downtown (because I've yet to try it), but this version tasted well-seasoned and meaty. The vegetables are a welcome sight, but watch out for the not-so-edible ginger and the inedible bay leaf. I'd consider ordering it again, especially now that we're getting soup weather daily, although I might have to make it a to-go order or otherwise bring my own soup spoon to avoid dealing with the inadequate plastic spoons.Given that the food here is reportedly much the same as OG Island Flavor, I wasn't quite as impressed as I'd hoped. I certainly enjoyed having plenty of leftovers with the huge portions, and I'll definitely come back to try their other proteins and specials (pork chops w/ mushrooms and onions, anyone?), but I expected to experience something "sublime" other than the music. Maybe I'll find it in the future.
Café 6=Nums!!! It's really sad to see that Simon restaurant is no longer, but this new burger bar is pretty darn good. The burn your face off is a great explanation of how your taste buds are going to be feeling. If you can't handle the heat, stay away from this burger .. My friend had the pull pork burger "the smoke out??" Something like that .. Like anything with BBQ sauce expect to get messy with this one ... Finally the Dr. Pepper burger .. A pretty thick portobello mushroom paired with a burger and grilled onions .. My least favorite of the 3 choices that were had. The burger was just too sweet (yes sweeter than the BBQ burger). Oh and you can't leave without trying dessert! Def need to try their nutella shake .. Okay I have more to say, but I'm getting hungry all over again .. I should've taken photos also .. Next time!Cafe 6 is the new cafe inside of the Palms Place casino. It replaces the Simon restaurant that was there for a long time. I wanted to check out what was different, and what was the same. There are some similarities, plus some differences, so I will go into detail.This restaurant is located on the 6th floor of the Palms Place. There is self parking and valet options all around, so just take the elevator to the 6th floor when you come inside of Palms Place. After walking through to the restaurant, I was immediately sat by the hostess, given my menu, and my server came by shortly and asked about my drink order. Looking around the restaurant, I noticed that they didn't do a major overhaul of the dining room, which is a good thing because the dining room does look elegant and comfortable, with great views of the pool and people watching.While perusing the menu, I noticed that the humorously whimsical Kerry Simon menu has been replaced by a simpler, more straightforward one, with a focus on being more casual and approachable. There is a wide variety of crowd pleasing favorites such as burgers, salads, sandwiches, as well as appetizers including chicken wings, and pretzels. I came in during lunch time, and during that time I was handed a drink menu that was full of standard beers, but also had a large selection of craft ones. I chose an IPA called Le Freak by a brewery in California called Green Flash. It was a hoppy beer that complimented my meal very well. The server took my food order and I waited for my food.There seemed to be a mixup in the ordering when my food arrived. I had ordered a couple appetizers and a burger meal. The burger came out first, rather than the appetizers. I didn't really mind since I'm not crazy anal like that, but my preference would be the other way around on most occasions.   So first, the burger. I ordered the Land and Sea. The burger was cooked to a perfect medium rare, just as I had requested. It was also seasoned well, and was hot and juicy. I could tell that they are using quality beef for their burgers. The crab dynamite was fresh. The condiments were subtle and very fresh, and the bun was toasted nicely, and held its shape very well. There is a choice of fries that comes with all the burgers, and I chose the waffle fries. They were hot and crispy, and seasoned well.Next were my appetizers. I ordered the chicken wings and beer battered rock shrimp. First, the wings. They used the big sized ones, which I appreciated. They were good wings, and sauced well. As for the rock shrimp, the batter was light and crispy, and the rock shrimp were fresh and of good quality. Here's a tip, eat the shrimp together with the celery, you're welcome.My server was really good, she asked if I was doing well and if the food was good, which it was. I thought they had priced their menu extremely well, taking into consideration that this is a casino restaurant.Suffice to say, I was really pleased with my meal, and would come back again. This is a spot that's making very solid food, with good quality product. The service is good and I enjoyed myself here.I was invited to come to Café 6 by PR at the Palms and was comped our meal.  We arrived when they opened at 5 PM and were seated along the window that faces the Palms Place pool.  Menus were left and in a very short time, our server, Alejandro, arrived to take drink orders.  He was soon back with our two iced teas.I had a question about the Burn Your Face Off burger and with Alejandro's description, I opted to go with something that would leave my face in tact--overhaul though it needs.  I ordered the Land and sea burger which the menu describes as Angus Beef, CRAB DYNAMITE, Red Onions, Fennel, Arugula, Breakfast Radishes, Havarti Cheese, Tomato Tartar Sauce, Hawaiian Sweet Bun.  I asked for it rare and that's the way it came.  My wife ordered the Dr. Pepper/Shroom burger that the menu describes as Angus Beef, Roasted Portabella, White Cheddar, Caramelized Onions, DR. PEPPER GLAZE, Dijon Mustard, Brioche Bun done medium which was the way it was done.  We each ordered skinny fries which come with your sandwich.Both burgers were very good.  I was pleased that my burger was indeed rare, something that some restaurants are hesitant to do.  The burgers were very large--probably 8 ounces.  My burger, while having a good amount of crab, didn't have much of a crab taste.  The crab was mined and mixed with a hot sauce to be the dynamite mentioned in the menu.  There wasn't much dynamite to it, but the burger was good.  The skinny fries were salted in the kitchen and were the perfect accompaniment to the burger.For dessert, we split the To Die For Chocolate which the menu describes as Chocolate Ice Cream, Frozen Brownie Bites, TOASTED MARSHMALLOWS, Crème Anglaise.  This was very good.  Very chocolatey--very worthy of its name!Throughout our meal, service was top notch.  Our iced teas were refilled without needing to ask.  Alejandro was very good!Café 6 would probably rate another star if there was more of a choice.  Except for burgers and sandwiches, there are only two "main course" options--salmon and steak frites--so it's a burger and sandwich café with some apps, salads, and desserts.  There is an option to build your own burger.  The price of the burgers amounts to Strip pricing in an off-Strip place.  While the room and the view of the pool are very nice, this isn't a stop I'd make.  It's much easier to get gourmet burgers in the neighborhood at more reasonable prices.  For tourists staying at the Palms or Palms Place, this is a perfectly good option.We were invited to Café 6 at Palms Place for a comped meal.  Located on the 6th floor, this hideaway has a very inviting, upscale feel, with floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking the pool.We were attended to immediately by Jeannette, our wonderful server.  Though the restaurant has what looks like a classy, full bar, there is no cocktail list.  There is no wine list.  Instead, the restaurant is selling off what remains from its predecessor's wine collection, and will not be replacing it.  Huh????The only Riesling available was the one we both dislike.  Instead I ordered an Ace Pineapple Cider from the Beer/Cider menu, and hubby had a Sierra Nevada.   If you don't like either, you're SOL.  Or, you could have a million-calorie shake to go along with your This is Not Health Food meal.  They're probably delicious.  Fattening stuff always is (except for Fried Twinkies).  It IS nice that they stock a selection of local brews, but as a non-beer drinker, the lack of wine is a huge turn-off for me.  The pineapple cider was interesting - tasty, but too sweet even for me.We started with the Baked Soft Pretzel, an enormous creature served with Dijon Mustard & Warm Cheese Sauce.  Loved it, but needed to make room for dinner, so it was the first entry in the take-home bag.We ordered a Dr. Pepper/Shroom burger for me, without the Dr. Pepper Glaze.  I never liked that soda, but did want all the other stuff on it:  the Roasted Portabello, White Cheddar, Caramelized Onions, and Dijon Mustard on a Brioche Bun.  I asked for it medium, and it was slightly less than that, but in the good 'ol days I would get my burgers medium-rare, so I was fine with it, Health Dept. be damned.Mr. G. got the Smokehouse Burger, and he enjoyed it a lot.  We ordered one with onion rings and one with waffle fries, well-done.  The onion rings were humungous, and I didn't dare eat more than one.  The waffle fries were perfect:  crisp, well-done but not burnt, simply scrumptious.  I couldn't even finish my burger, and we took home a lot of fries and the remaining onion rings.We finished up with dessert - the To Die For Chocolate.  We were too full to go the whole nine yards, so we asked for the ice cream to be served and all the other stuff packed to go.  We did miss the beautiful presentation that I've seen in some of the photos posted here, but the three scoops of chocolate ice cream that were served to us made me almost comatose, 'cause I ate too much of it.Café 6 has a lot going for it:  great atmosphere, big and tasty burgers, rings, fries, pretzels, desserts, stellar service.  But not so great menu:  just TWO entrees, a few "sammiches" that don't sound particularly enticing, a bar that looks like a bar, but maybe it's just a mirage (oh, that's a different hotel), Strip pricing.  If you're craving a burger and a beer, this may just be your place.I loved the décor and poolside setting when this spot was Simon's, but service was terrible. Glad to see that Café 6 has tasty burgers and a total turnaround in the service department- but the cuisine doesn't really fit the spa-like locale. That said, I'd still keep this spot in mind for a great burger.FRIED PICKLES: These are spears instead of the expected chips, perfectly crisp and served with a trio of dipping sauces (an acidic ranch, a sweet bbq, and a spicy sriracha). Interesting presentation features vinegar chips under the pickles? THE WEDGIE: More like a wedge salad mated with a BLTA sandwich, minus the bread. Presentation deconstructed the wedge to more manageable pieces,  with generous amounts of avocado and bleu cheese, two slices of bacon. One of the few fresh/healthy options, lots of textural contrast, would get again.MINI BURGERSTURKEY SNACK: Turkey burger with lettuce, avocado, swiss, and apple-cranberry marmalade on a Taro bun. The purple taro bun is fun and slightly sweet, tastes like a Hawaiian roll. This is a great turkey burger, surprisingly juicy.BACON BLEU: Angus patty with bacon (allegedly, didn't detect any on ours?), bleu cheese sauce, LTO, on brioche bun. Lovely buttery bun and an incredibly strong sauce, burger was juicy, a bite of perfection.TOADSTOOL SWISS: Angus patty with roasted portabella, caramelized onion, lettuce, swiss, Dijon mustard, house-made ketchup. The burger I'd most anticipated was underwhelming. Portabella lacked flavor, mustard didn't really harmonize with other ingredients, small chopped onions were falling all over the plate and didn't stay on the burger.FULL-SIZE BURGERDR. PEPPER SHROOM BURGER: Huge, thick Angus patty with roasted portabella, white cheddar, caramelized onion, Dr. Pepper glaze, Dijon mustard on brioche bun. The full sized burgers are gigantic! Aside from our cooking issues (below), the sweet Dr. Pepper glaze worked better than expected and added to the mushrooms' savory meatiness. Really enjoyed the flavors of this burger. WAFFLE FRIES: These are perfectly crisp and wonderfully seasoned, served with a spicy ketchup with a lot of kick. I ate way too many of these, enjoying them more than any other version in recent memory.NUTELLA DONUTS: Puffy donut holes, dusted in cinnamon-sugar and served with a trio of sauces (the crème anglaise being my favorite). Nutella filling was a good amount, not overflowing, happy my BF pushed to order these despite my not being a dessert fan.  I recommend the Trio of Sliders ($14), which allows you to try more burger styles, though the giant patty of the full-size burger is a good value. The sliders were cooked perfectly, whereas our full-sized burger was served first overcooked (to well done) then redone to practically rare. If you're charging $15/burger, every one should be cooked perfectly- an area to improve upon.Service was fairly good: lots of positive staff around to check up on us, they had no problem remaking our burger or upselling drinks, apps, and desserts. Now if only they could get people in the door! Despite a Friday evening date-night, there were few diners here and they were mostly older groups. Location away from the casino floor plus $15 burgers (pricey for some) doesn't really help. Hoping this place lasts as a concept (as I want to return for the bbq brisket burger!) , but it doesn't really fit the location.Confused why they have 5 stars, but oh well. We came here after we checked into the Palms Place and were disappointed with the food. The service, however, was fantastic. Our server was amazing and definitely went the extra mile to take care of us. He was really excited and kept the energy high even though we were both incredibly tired. We ordered the Rock Shrimp appetizer, I ordered a "Build Your Own" turkey burger, he ordered their "Smokeout" (which is apparently what they are known for) and we also had the sweet potato and skinny fries. The shrimp appetizer was okay. It wasn't great or absolutely terrible. I think the batter could have been a little better and fried a little longer, and I don't think they should toss it in the Tobasco Ranch. I LOVE Tobasco, however it made it really soggy. This was probably the best thing we ordered. My turkey burger was really bland. I got the normal toppings on it (lettuce, tomato, onions) and added mushrooms. They put way too many onions on there and it was an overwhelming taste. Usually I don't complain about that because I do like onions, but they must have given me half of an onion. The Smokeout looked unappetizing and he said he was really unhappy with it. I didn't even want to try it. The sweet potato fries were pretty good but a tad too salty. We didn't come back here, although we would have if the food was good. It's convenient if you want something basic...like fries. I don't recommend this place.I'm not a burger person. I was skeptical about coming here... But I am a total fan. It's located in palms place where the old Simons use to be. We went on a Sunday night... It wasn't busy... But it definitely should be! We were greeted immediately and sat a comfortable table. Our server was an amazing young man from back east. Dang, I wish I remembered his name... Probably the best service I've had out in a long time. We ordered the pretzel as an app. Actually... My boyfriend and his friend ordered it. It was huge! A total mealWithin itself and definitely not vegan... But appeared to be extremely enjoyable. I ordered a glass of wine and the Virgin lettuce wraps... Holy smokes!!! They were super flavorful... Totally vegan... And absolutely delicious! Score!! My boyfriend ordered 3 pork belly sliders and fries and our friend ordered the chicken Caesar salad. Everyone loved their food. Of course... We left with left overs... But it was absolutely delicious. Will I be returning? Definitely!
Blue Ribbon Fried Chicken=Cluck yeah, fried chicken! The newest spot to hit downtown Summerlin features the Bromberg brothers' take on your favorite fried feathered friend, available in tenders, wings, and sandwiches, with sides, salads, and sodas. That's a lot of alliteration.SANDWICHES: The classic Blue Ribbon sandwich is a solid offering with special sauce, while the Bluebird kicks it up with blue cheese, red onion, and bacon. The chicken for both was super-juicy without being greasy, but the breading didn't adhere very well and the chicken itself didn't have much flavor. I appreciate that the blue cheese on the Bluebird is more of a sauce than crumbles, allowing for more even distribution of flavor.SIDES: A small is just under $4, while a large is just over $7. Steep. Mashed potatoes didn't taste instant but also weren't worth the price. The small fry is a huge portion of skinny-cut seasoned spuds, great for sampling all of their dipping sauces!DIPPING SAUCES: BRBQ (bourbon-tinged barbecue), Chipotle honey (possibly my favorite), habanero hot (is hot), wasabi honey (very slight wasabi flavor), and a couple of others. I felt that the sauces were a nice touch, but wish the chicken itself had more flavor. The multitude of sauces seem to be compensating.SODAS: Their fountain drink station features cane-sugar sodas. I'm not generally a soda fan, but there was no button for water so I sampled a few and was surprised to really enjoy them. The ginger ale, crème soda, lemon-lime, and black cherry, in that order, were my top picks. There were a few I didn't try.SERVICE. Here's where I'm torn on what to rate this place. I understand I went on their second day, but I experienced a few hiccups (charged incorrectly, then brought the wrong order). However, management was quick to apologize and fix the issues, and the service from one employee in the dining room in particular was awesome. Rounding up for that dude.Overall, this spot is a bit overpriced for what you get, but it's in downtown Summerlin so no one's really surprised. Recommend the wing lunchbox combo (5 wings, fries, and a drink for $8) for a better value, only available 11-3PM, Mon-Fri.EDIT: Dropping a star. Returned for another visit, still had issues with my order. This time I didn't bother bringing it to their attention. You've been open two months and the kitchen still doesn't know the menu? Retrain your staff or hire new people who care.My coworker who usually shows zero emotion showed so much emotion and raved about how delicious the fried chicken was at Blue Ribbon on the Strip, so I was stoked when this place opened! I really wanted to love this place since I LOVE fried chicken, but the bf and I were sorely disappointed after eating there last night. The menu had plenty of options with tenders, boneless thighs, wings, sandwiches, salads, sides, 3 draft beers, and cane sugar sodas. We each decided to go with the 2 pc tender meal ($9.75), a boneless thigh ($3.75), and a cane sugar soda ($2.75). The 2 pc tender meal came with a side of cole slaw and shoestring fries. Each table was stocked with a variety of sauces: Bahhhbq, Chipotle Honey, Wasabi Honey, Habanero Hot Sauce (their house hot sauce though personally I prefer buffalo), and... I feel like there was one more besides plain ketchup but I can't remember.We were pretty excited and did our fair share of taking pictures of our food (we're THOSE ppl, I know) before diving in. Everything was alright - started with the fries which were pretty good, tenders had great breading and seasoning but were a little on the dry side in both orders, cole slaw was fresh and vinegary, and the ginger ale soda was refreshing. The seasoning on the chicken is already delicious itself so I didn't think there was much need for the sauces unless you were using the sauce to make the dry tenders more juicy. Overall, the above mentioned were good though I'd swap out the tenders to try the wings.Here comes the big disappointment and my primary reason for dropping it from a 3 star to a 1: our boneless fried chicken thigh was UNCOOKED in the center!! It looked perfectly fried on the outside and we had started to peel off some of the chicken skin to eat and were excited because it was seasoned well and crispy, but upon tearing the thigh open we noticed the entire center was uncooked! Thank goodness neither of us jumped the gun and bit straight into the chicken thigh. It would be understandable (though still unacceptable) if maybe a tiny bit of the chicken was UNDERcooked, but we literally had an UNcooked center. It took us a moment to process the raw chicken we were staring at before bringing it to the counter to show them. The cashier that helped us said sorry and said they would redo the 2 boneless thighs. A few mins later we got back up to ask when they would be done and requested it to go since we had lost our appetites already. The gentleman that spoke with us seemed to be one of the supervisors but showed less apologetic emotion than the cashier. Meh. Our thighs were finally ready and was brought to our table boxed up with fries, a bottle of their habanero hot sauce, and a chocolate shake. The manager (I'm assuming) apologized and was very courteous. It was nice of them to throw in the extras along with our new order of thighs, but it wasn't able to erase our disappointment. When we walked out, there was a guy standing outside texting that sorta looked like Bruce Bromberg? but maybe not... Couldn't really tell because it was dark and he had glasses on. Anyway, he said, "sorry again guys. They pulled the wrong piece out of the fryer too early."  Ah, so that's why... Yikes?!?!Maybe I'll give this place another chance eventually, but definitely not for a really really long time. I understand they just opened and may experience hiccups, but what a rookie, gross, and dangerous mistake to make on chicken when you're a fried chicken restaurant. There's too many other dining options in Downtown Summerlin for them to risk making a mistake this big. Overall- Service could improve to be more consistent from all employees. Dining room was clean and had TVs. I recommend taking a close gander at your chicken to make sure it's edible before consuming.To the owners of Blue Ribbon Fried Chicken, I would like to offer my heartfelt apologies just in case the spirit of my dearly departed grandmother appears and hits you with her cast iron skillet.  Yes...your chicken is that good.As a transplant from the Great American Southeast, I am somewhat of a chicken snob, and have been continually amazed at the lack of quality fried fowl west of the Mississippi.  One of my fondest childhood memories is of grandma's cast iron skillet fried chicken.  Every Thursday night was chicken night, and man could she fricassee a bird.   It wasn't a meal as much as it was an event.After joining the Navy in the 80's (yeah I'm and old dude) and moving to San Diego, I realized that the only easily attainable fried chicken was from the Colonel.  It may have been good stuff a long time ago when he was fryin' it up himself at his roadside diner, but in the decades that have followed Pepsi Co. has done an excellent job of turning it into an over-salted, polymer-laced, fast food facsimile of a bone-in Chicken McNugget.  Put another way...yuck.Having recently moved to Summerlin Las Vegas, my wife and I have spent our weekends exploring the Valley's ample food scene.  To my chagrin however, all the highly touted chicken joints in town have fallen flat.  It seemed as if we were doomed to seek what pleasure we could from a greasy bucket of corporate squab emblazoned with the Colonel's evil grinning face.  I can almost see him in his secret control room under Mount Charleston, laughing maniacally as he watches us on the mini-cam inserted in one of our thighs by regional marketing.  Yeah, I know he is dead...or is he?Then, just today, as I was strolling through Downtown Summerlin wondering what I would have for lunch, I stumbled upon Blue Ribbon Fried Chicken.  "How good could this possibly be," I thought to myself as I stopped to look at the menu.   After all, I am sure it is just a KFC in disguise.  Skepticism aside, I was intrigued so I threw caution to the wind, went in, and ordered their "Two Thigh" dinner.  I waited about 10 minutes for my meal, and when it arrived it was fresh and beautifully prepared.  If you are a connoisseur of chicken, you know when you see a special piece of bird, and this was one of those moments.  I had not seen such a thigh since Baywatch was cancelled. This is where Grandma starts getting mad...The coating was crisp, well-seasoned, and created a wonderful shell for the moist and tender thigh meat inside.  I doused my first bite with an ample portion of wildflower honey and began slip back in time.  I looked into the open kitchen and, just for a moment, thought I saw grandmother working the fryer.  This was good stuff.  After a couple more bites of my glorious bird, I tasted my side of collard greens and was pleased to see that Blue Ribbon had gotten them right too.  It tasted just like it had come out of a South Georgia pressure cooker.  Grandma is really beside herself at this point...Finally I took a deep swig of iced tea and was pleased to discover that Blue Ribbon knew their brew. Tea is extremely important in the south.  We drink it more than Budweiser at a NASCAR race, and it can make or break a meal.  In these days of soda fountain tea-flavored chemicals, a Pepsi Co. invention no doubt, finding an establishment that serves real tea is always refreshing. Grandma is now raising the skillet over her head...In the final analysis, I have determined that Blue Ribbon Fried Chicken may well make some of the best fried chicken I have had the pleasure of consuming.  Grandma swings...  I am not sure if it is fast food or not but, in the words of the late Justin Wilson, it is so good you will want to stand up an' slap someone...but don't...just enjoy your meal.  Grandma's pan finds its target...sorry guys.With a little fine tuning this spot could be excellent. The first time I stopped by the tenders were soggy and oily. But on subsequent visits the wings have been crispy and the Blue Bird sandwich has become one of my favorite chicken sandwiches around. I like the seasoning on the tenders and wings, but remember the crust being thicker and crunchier at Brooklyn Bowl, which is also owned by the Bromberg brothers. A kid's meal only comes with one tender. I wish they used a more mild seasoning for the kid's meals. My guy didn't care for the spices. While I do like this place, prices are too high for a fast casual spot to make me a frequent visitor. The 2 piece tender meal didn't fill me up and that was around $12 for the meal plus a drink. I understand the quality is higher than fast food spots, but I can't spend $15 or more on lunch on a regular basis. If I bring the family the price triples. The best bargain is the lunchbox special (available M-F 11am-4pm) which includes 5 wings, fries, and a drink.Items Selected:Nutella, Vanilla, and Caramel ShakesHush PuppiesSmorgasbird - Lettuce, Cucumbers, Tomatoes, Chicken Cutlets, Pineapple Slices, Pickles, Fries, Sour Cream, Cheddar Cheese, Bacon, Sauteed BBQ Chicken, Pickled Peppers2 Strips, 2 WingsAdobo CornCollards & BaconFounded by the Bromberg Brothers and featuring the duo's first foray into the 'burbs, Blue Ribbon Fried Chicken arrived in Downtown Summerlin by way of New York earlier this summer and although the quick casual concept has been questioned for high prices as well as uneven cooking ever since opening it was with a friend and his child that I sat down for lunch on Saturday, almost every off-putting rumor soon confirmed.Nicely lit and well adorned with amenities including motion sensing trash compactors, LCD televisions, housemade sauces, plus a fountain featuring artisan sodas from Boylan's, a visit to Blue Ribbon begins at a counter with smiling servers - the dining decisions largely sandwiches, combos, and sides with additional options for shakes or salads, plus single tenders, wings, or thighs.Taking note of a few specials, the August-only "Smorgasbird" with a portion of the proceeds benefiting  Multiple Sclerosis offered in addition to perplexingly priced hush puppies - $3.75 for a half-dozen or $7.95 for ten - it was after some perusal that an order soon completed, the fifteen minute wait with one of those vibrating flashy buzzers spent sitting in one of several unpadded booths.Certainly not a cheap meal, the total before tax and tip north of $55 for what would prove less than enough to sate a family of four were it not for the three excellent pieces of egg bread wrapped around the charitable sandwich, it was largely a matter of principle that the Smorgasbird was ordered and with two boneless cutlets spiced quite unlike the Bromberg chicken at Blue Ribbon or Brooklyn Bowl suffice it to say that each piece was almost too dry on its own to be enjoyable, the better bites found in barbequed bits serve atop cheesy fries tinged in peppers while anemic looking tomatoes made one question sourcing during the ingredients peak time of year.Finding the tenders to be as oddly spiced and devoid of moisture as the cutlets while wings at least maintained their texture thanks to the presence of a bone, it was onward to sides that the meal progressed and although the hushpuppies were each quite small the flavors of sweet corn were thankfully prominent, the same not to be said of soft collards barely bolstered by pork let alone the 'adobo corn' which certainly would have benefited greatly from some salt.At this point seeing the emperor for his lack of clothes while wondering why the duo opts to change their chicken at each venue when the original version is the one that earned them such acclaim, it was in a trio of shakes that the meal concluded and although none were particularly innovative each was clearly crafted of good ice cream, the vanilla trending a bit thin and mellow while the Nutella and caramel were decidedly sweet and thick enough to stick a spoon up straight.Overpriced and overseasoned with little more than a 'name' to justify the hype Blue Ribbon Fried Chicken joins the likes of most of Downtown Summerlin's imported eateries, a situation that makes one wonder just how long the public will continue to bite.
Pizzeria Omaggio=We went here for lunch today and were extremely impressed.  The staff was very friendly and accommodating and the pizza was delicious.  The crust was crispy and didn't get soggy due to the sauce like most other pizzas I have had. The Trio pizza is a great alternative to a plain pepperoni pizza with fresh basil, mozzerella, and ricotta. You can taste that all the ingredients are fresh.  Pizzeria Omaggio is a great addition to the Charlotte pizza scene and other pizzerias should take note!I have been here a couple times now and am really enjoying it. There are a handful of restaurants that could learn from Pizzeria Omaggio's owner/manager - he is always there and actively engaged in the front and back. He recognizes my wife and I, always making conversation and recommendations. It's nice when you can put a face to the business. The pizza is great and is made right behind the counter. The trio and Omaggio special are fantastic. They are about 11 inches and can be shared. You can also build your own from a lengthy variety of ingredients. The soups and salads are on my list of dishes to try on my next visit - they look delicious coming out of the kitchen. Pizzeria Omaggio has put a lot of work into the interior. Clean and bright with marble counters. They have made the space their own - something that the previous pizzeria in this location failed at. I am optimistic that Pizzeria Omaggio will stick around for a while. They are doing everything right and has been well received from what I have been reading.The Mr and I were excited to try a brand new pizza spot in the neighborhood so we walked in mid-afternoon on a Friday to see what was up. We were greeted by friendly staff and were quite impressed with the decor and ordering counter setup. Our selection was a 4 cheese pizza and one with eggplant, red pepper and balsamic as well as a couple of canned drinks. This is where it got disappointing. From my first bite of pizza I realized that something was missing. Salt. Yep. The crust was just boring. No flavor (although the texture was really nice).The pizza toppings were fine...or would have been, had they been properly seasoned. The balsamic was somehow not piquant at all. I waited for the Mr's reaction and it was identical to mine. We both covered our pizzas in what our friends' kids call "shakey cheese" or the table-side Parmesan that was brought out with our meal. Honestly, it was one of the only ways we made it through. So here we were, wondering if we had missed something because both our pizzas were sauce-less. Maybe if we had ordered a pie with their marinara, the salinity of the sauce would have perked things up. So the Mr walked back up to the counter and asked for some of their marinara. And it tasted like unseasoned stewed tomatoes. Service is impeccable. Space is perfect. Setup is simple. Food...well, maybe we just went on an off day. I know they're probably working out some kinks. Go see for yourself. Maybe you'll have a different experience than we did.
Angara Indian Spice Grill=Formerly a Custom Built Pizza, this location has been completely remodeled and transformed into a nice Indian restaurant with lunch buffet ($11) and a la carte dinner. Appears to be family owned and operated, service is polite and prompt.Upon entry and seating, you are immediately asked for your naan preference (plain vs garlic, go for the garlic!) and released to the buffet- incredible samosas, two types of rice, 5 vegetarian dishes, 5 meat dishes,  soup, and a simple fruit/salad/condiment bar. Standouts for me were the garlic naan, the incredible samosas, and a robust but not spicy goat curry. I found the tandoori chicken a bit try, the available soup too peppery, and was disappointed not to find saag paneer. Even so, I'd keep this spot in mind if I'm on this side of town and in need of a carb load... or just more incredible samosas!
Got Que?=My family has been looking forward to giving this new BBQ restaurant here in Surprise a try for a long time.  After countless delays, and missed opportunities due to the restaurant being closed we had our chance!  Since there are three of us, we decided on the family meal with slaw and beans as sides.  Our first choice was cheesy potatoes, but as often is the case mentioned in other reviews, they were out of something.  Overall I will say the menu is pretty limited, and you shouldn't expect to find the variety you would find at a Rudys, or Honey Bears.  As for the food, put it this way.  We ended up throwing most of everything out and going to plan B.  The positive was the lean quality of the pulled pork.  That's where it ends however.  The meat had absolutely no flavor, the store bought hamburger rolls they give you tasted stale, the BBQ sauce tasted only like ketchup, the beans had no flavor or texture, and the slaw was dry and loaded with ground pepper.  I rate "Got Que? " a two out of five based on the lean quality of the pork and friendly staff.  Overall however I just literally throw $25 in the trash, and just don't see a reason to return.  Sadly, if you want quality "Que", you will have to keep making the drive to outside of Surprise.
Curry Leaf Flavors of India=Experience:  my friend Lance (check out his review on here) tried this place an raved about the food. So he invited a few friends to come try it out. We came around 7:00 for dinner. Facility: beautiful!  This is a very upscale, modern decor with heavy Indian influence. So beautifully done!!! They have tables and chairs, bar seating, and some booths. They have some outside seating coming soon too!  I loved being able to look around and having some things to look at...from the Ballywood-esque mural, to the beautiful window treatments. I have to mention the seats were pretty comfortable too, which is rare in a restaurant. Service:  This is the only reason, I'm marking them down. Otherwise they would have a 5 star from me. They are very polite servers; however, the first thing we ordered, was my cheese naan and the eggplant. This was my main meal. The cheese naan was the last thing that came out, after asking 4 times for it.  I was actually full eating other folks food by the time I got it. One waitress I questioned on the status said they didn't even have cheese naan, although it was on the menu. Then she brought another Garlic naan instead. When they finally brought my naan, they said the extra garlic naan they brought by mistake was on them.  Of course!  How about comping my cheese naan instead!  They also took forever to bring out another friends Chicken Marsala. Hopefully they get it together soon. I do love how personable the staff was, and the owner even came out to greet and talk to us.Food:  A-maz-ing!  I love Indian food and this did not disappoint.  Everything we had was good...honestly, there was nothing I disliked. We ordered a lot, so I will try to remember all we ordered. We asked for everything very hot on the spicy scale. Cheese naan - 5/5 so good and cheesy!!!Garlic naan - 5/5 hot and fresh!Basmati rice - we had order rice to go along with our meals, as it's not included. It was cooked perfectly. Chili Paneer - 6/5 yep, that good!  It had a great chili sauce it was tossed in, and was crispy outside, with a creamy, cheesy middle. Yum!!!Murgh Tikka Trio - 4/5 every piece of chicken was spiced well and still juicy in the middle. I did find myself adding more sauce though. Samosa - 4/5 loved, but the cheese corn was not my fav.  I loved the potato the most and then the pea. They were all crispy, hot and good!Baingan Bharta - the eggplant dish I ordered - 5/5 so yum with a nice texture from the pop of the peas. I loved the flavor and this went well with the naan Chicken Saag - 5/5 great flavors, tender chicken. Madras - 5/5 we ordered the lamb for this one...it was my favorite. It was creamy and loaded with flavor. Loved to dip my naan in the sauce too!!!Chicken Tikka Marasala - 5/5 this was the spiciest of our dishes with an amazing flavor*I also wished they offered something complimentary, such as naan with a full meal or even the rice with a big order such as ours.  I hate when places make you order every piece of the meal to make it a meal. Overall: I do realize, they are brand new and still working on their groove, so I'm definitely willing to come back in a month or so, and hope they got it all together, so I can bump to a 5. Because the food is already there!!!!!Come try it out!  It's delicious!!!It won't take a psychic to see more Indian dinners in my future now that there's a quality spot around these parts.I was sold on Lamb Rogan Josh within seconds of perusing the menu.  The boneless pieces of braised lamb in thick, rich curry hit the inside "spot" that only Indian cuisine can.  The slow cooked tenderness of the meat was ideal and required minimal work with a knife.  Hearty and comforting, it was like wearing a mental snuggie.My wife got the Saag Paneer and enjoyed every bit of its pureed spinach glory.  Their homemade cheese was a bit different than any other we've tried as it was softer, more like buffalo mozzarella, yet it still retained some of that signature firmness that made it undeniably paneer.  Maybe their secret is milk with a higher fat content?  We ordered this dish "hot" which wasn't over the top spicy, but a nice smooth burn from start to finish.   The $6 vegetable sides were great to see as well.  Many places don't offer a half portion, so if I really wanted Chana Masala, my only choice would be to order an extra entrée.  We went with the Baingan Bharta, basically an eggplant mash which was a nice change up from the other plates.  I also liked that the bowls of rice that accompanied each dish were of generous portions unlike their only nearby competitor a few miles south, which only offer rice in a kid size.I am curious to see if they stick with entrees for lunch or cave with the rest of the in crowd and go buffet.  That won't deter me from going back during those hours though.  Can't wait to try more!Flavors are on point here at Curry Leaf. No buffet, just a la carte entrees, apps, sides, and desserts. I stuck to some fairly safe favorite dishes and found them all to be of great quality with deep, complex flavors. Ambiance is going for an upscale feel but pricing is reasonable.SAAG PANEER: Pure vegetarian Indian comfort, with unusually creamy and plentiful paneer. Pairs fabulously with the garlic naan (which was deliciously fragrant and beautifully blistered), this is my preferred meal.ROGAN JOSH: BF's pick, ordered medium, with a spicy and flavorful sauce. Lamb was in large, plentiful chunks but could have been more tender. Both main dishes included rice.BAINGAN BHARTA: Side of tandoori-smoked eggplant mash was contender for my favorite dish, with great smoky flavor and good texture. A bargain at $6/side.KULFI TRIO: We couldn't resist dessert, and the house-made ice creams fulfilled out sweets craving with a bright mango flavor, sweet raspberry, and nutty pistachio. Couldn't pick a favorite as they were all good, with great creamy consistency. Interior is upscale with modern (but slightly uncomfortable) chairs and a large bar area (but no alcohol license?), makes for an intimate date-night dinner spot. Unclear whether they plan to expand seating into the adjacent patio area. Service was attentive and polite throughout. This is one of those places I would come back and get the exact same meal, rather than trying more on the menu. They do the classic dishes extremely well and the portions were generous. Great option for a vegetarian meal.I have had a lot of Indian food in my life. I love Indian food. This is hands down the best Indian food I have had and not only in Vegas, not only in the US - but in my life.Came here with my boyfriend to try something new and saw good reviews on here. Unfortunately I have Celiac so can't have any gluten. We called ahead and asked, the dude on the phone said no gluten - no problem. So we went.And we are both blown away.After letting the (super sweet and attentive) waiter know I'm gluten free, we started with the chili paneer. When it came out we noticed it was breaded so I got scared for a second; then out of the blue the Chef and owner Ritesh comes to the table, introduces himself and says 'Don't worry about the breading, I used rice and chickpea flour for you so it would be gluten free.' WOW! Such dedication to great service.The chili paneer was absolutely unbelievable and so were our entrees (Chicken Tikka Marsala, Paneer Vindaloo, and sides of yellow Dal and eggplant).We will definitely be back and I cannot recommend this place enough. Whether you're gluten free or not, the food here is so fantastic and the staff and owner are so amazing that you're missing out if you don't give it a try!!After reading my friend, Philip T.'s review, I knew I had to come here and I'm so glad I did.  I got here at 12:15.  The restaurant is a pleasant place with lots of thought put into the interior design.I was seated promptly and given the lunch and wine menus.  I was brought water immediately and I looked at the menu although I had quite thoroughly studied the lunch offerings.  Their lunch menu is small but there are some very good choices.My server came to take my order and I got the lamb Rogan josh.  When asked if I wanted it hot, medium, or mild for spiciness, I questioned how hot their hot was.  (I know, stupid question!)  When Navi, my server, explained that it was hot I opted to go with medium but he offered another choice--medium to hot.  That was it.  (BTW, next time I'll get the hot.  This was spicy but it doesn't hit high on my spiciness meter.  I was given a choice of plain, butter, or garlic naan and I went with the garlic.After taking some photos of the restaurant, the food arrived and I was ready to dig in.  The lamb Rogan josh, a Kashmiri dish, was perfect!  There was a nice degree of spiciness to compliment the fennel, ginger, onion, and Kashmiri spice sauce.  The lamb was nicely tender.  The garlic naan was one of the few I've gotten where I've tasted much garlic.  Tearing pieces of naan and grabbing rice and sauce with my fingers, I was enjoying lunch to the max.While eating, Navi asked me if I was a photographer and I explained reviewing for Yelp.  In a short time, the chef/owner came out to greet me and ask me how I found out about the restaurant and how I liked the food.  We chatted for a bit and I noticed on his chef's jacket, there were both Curry Leaf Flavors of India and Saffron Flavors of India.  It turns out he cooked at Saffron for a couple of years for his brother-in-law and now has opened his own place.  He went to another table and then returned to the kitchen.  A very pleasant, welcoming man!When finished, Navi asked about dessert.  I didn't want rice pudding and my experiences with gulab jamun in the past have been mixed.  But, I opted for the gulab jamun.  Navi asked if I wanted it hot or cool.  I don't think I've ever had it any way but somewhat cool so I went with hot.  What a great choice!!  The saffron, cardamom syrup on the fried milk cakes was excellent.  There was sweetness but it was just right.  There were also small pieces of slivered almond which I haven't seen before.I was there for about an hour.  That's not indicative of slowness with the kitchen.  Wait time was short, but I wanted to savor the lamb and its sauce to the maximum so I didn't hurry with my lunch.  Others left the restaurant during this time and weren't replaced with new customers.  I'm wondering if they can make it without a lunch buffet.  The price is more than Indian buffets near UNLV.  The nice thing for me is that it's so close to home.I took a photo of their large patio.  I forgot to ask if they would have tables there when it's cooler but it would make a nice place to eat out when the 100 degree weather leaves.  And before I left, I took one of their menus so I can order take out next week.  I'm so glad they're here!For starters, we were quite impressed with the decor, a mixture of traditional and modern.  Great lighting, too. It has a large patio, not quite set up yet, but it was way too hot to eat outside anyway.  I asked about a wine list, and our waiter, Navi, brought over a single page that had two whites and four reds (along with a few beers).  I'm a white wine drinker, but can't handle either of the two, Chardonnay and Pinot Grigio.  They honestly get me sick.  He offered to go to the nearby liquor store and bring back anything I wanted.  I was going to skip the wine (horrors!), but the owner came out.  He explained that they were set to have a meeting this week with the wine rep, and they were working on setting up a full bar service, including more and different wines and specialty cocktails.  Though I posted a pic of the current list, I'm going to remove it.  I don't think it's fair to keep it, since the restaurant is new and still a work in progress.The owner, Ritesh, is a highly educated professional who switched to cooking as a second career.  We thoroughly enjoyed talking with him, and his desire to please radiated during our whole meal.  He insisted that Navi go get the wine I wanted, so I acquiesced. I was a happy camper.The menu is so atypical of the usual Indian restaurant.  It's very small, but everything is cooked fresh.  Ritesh explained that this allows him to focus on the quality of each dish.  He will, though, be adding a few other items, including a thali, which we love to order, since it allows you to sample a variety of food.We started with samosas, an order of three:  one with peas, another with potato, and the third with paneer and corn.  I don't think I've ever seen corn in an Indian restaurant before.  They were incredibly light, with pastry unlike the usual Chinese eggroll stuff you usually get, and the fillings were delicious, expecially the paneer and corn.  I'm not a pea lover, but loved the dense filling of that one.  The creamy mint and tangy tamarind sauces were yummy.For our mains we shared a Saag curry bowl, with chicken added, as well as paneer and fresh vegetables.  We ordered both of our dishes medium-spicy, and that's how it was.  Along with that we got Baingan barta, and the smaller size of smoked eggplant dish was a good accompaniment to the large portion of Saag. The garlic naan we ordered was covered with minced FRESH garlic. Last time we had it, at a different place, I couldn't even see or taste garlic.  As it was, I could barely eat much of the main courses after the filling Samosas, but then, I'm not a very big eater.  We'll have my very favorite meal - leftovers - tonight.As if the great food and phenomenal service weren't enough, a treat awaited us at the end.  Our wonderful waiter was nearby and heard me toast Herb for his birthday.  He said "Oh, is it your birthday?"  I told him it had actually been two days before.  But when we finished packing up the leftovers, Navi and Ritesh came out with a birthday dessert for us to share - their beautiful Kulfi trio:  mango, pistachio and raspberry, artfully presented on a long rectangular plate.Even better than the fact that it was a delicious meal, it was a special and memorable experience, and I wish Curry Leaf a long and prosperous life.Very excited to have this amazing Indian restaurant close to where I live, work, and play. The restaurant is simply beautiful, the food is top notch, and the service was excellent.We started with the garlic Naan bread and Baingan Bharta, which is Tandoori smoked eggplant that is mashed with various herbs. It comes in a small half size pot for half the price making it easy to combine with any entree. The flavors were extraordinary.This was followed by two curry entree's, each served with long grain white rice. We had the Chicken Tikka Masala and the Lamb Vindaloo at a medium spice level. The Tikka Masala has marinated chicken chunks with an onion-tomato tandoor sauce. The Vindaloo has a distinctive onion, garlic, red chili & vinegar sauce flavor. They were both mouth-watering!  - but, literally, the Vindaloo was slightly more spicy than the Tikka Masala due to the red chili's. Of course, the temperature is nothing for those that enjoy heaping spoonfuls of overpowering spiciness on a regular basis.I can't wait to try more items on the menu. The only downside: The restaurant has a "suggested" gratuity on the check that is between 15-20% of the grand total including tax. Gratuity should not be factored on top of sales tax; maybe the restaurant is hoping for the extremely generous types that likes tipping more than 20%.It's exactly a month since I was here the first time.  I came back for take out and I was delighted by the food.I called late in the afternoon for pick up after their dinner opening time.  I ordered the trio of samosas called Samosa Teen Tarike.  One was filled with green peas, one with potato, and one with paneer and corn.  The pastry was light and fried perfectly and the fillings were very tasty.  I really didn't need the sauces that were packed with them--a mint sauce and a tamarind sauce.  Both were good.For mains, I ordered chicken tikka masala for my wife--spice level mild--and I got the Madras curry with chicken and spice level hot.  Both were well done and the sauces were mild and hot as we both wanted.  We got two containers of basmati rice with the curries.I got a double order of garlic naan and it was as good as the first time I was here.  The order was packed perfectly for the short ride home and everything was hot when I opened the containers.A word about service.  Navi took my payment and offered me a glass of water at the bar while I waited.  Mr. Patel, the owner, came out to speak with me as he had done when I was there before.  He is a very genial man and he lets his passion for his restaurant and the quality of the food he serves come out.  We chatted a bit about the patio being opened soon as the weather is cooling. I'll be returning often.  Again, I say I'm glad they're a short drive from home and I'll be back.5 Stars for Delicious & Authentic Indian Cuisine!5 Stars for Friendly & Exceptional Service!5 Stars for Beautiful Ambience!5 Stars for Impeccable Cleanliness!5 Stars for Opening 3 Months Ago in an area of town that lacked an amazing Indian restaurant.Located in the SW part of the Valley, on Ft.

He must be special to be adored by so many pretty wives, right?Ritesh is also a Chef and the Owner of Curry Leaf Flavors Of India. They also own Saffron Indian restaurant here in town. Ritesh also visited our table and offered friendly conversation. He shared his plans to expand the restaurant outside w/ patio dining now that the weather has cooled off.We ate from the lunch menu which will be changed around a bit w/ addtional creative entrees, according to Ritesh. The Basmati Rice was perfectly cooked served w/ our orders of Chicken Tikka Masala and Korma w/ chicken. The garlic naan was the best I ever tasted and i've dined at several Indian restaurants.Chicken Tikka Masala - Marinated chicken chunks grilled in tandoor w/ onion-tomato sauce.Korma - Creamy onion cashew coconut sauce w/ spices, seasonal vegetables. Added chicken for a buck!House water was served in nice glassware and was crystal clear!Each dish was served in pretty silver bowls w/ large white plates and nice silverware. Cloth napkins! Overall, Excellence!TIP: take a spoonful of fennel from the bowl @ the Full Bar on your way out to cool you down and help w/ after taste and digestion.This entire restaurant is Spotless! Certainly worthy of the earned Grade A Rating by So. NV. Health District. The interior decor is beautiful,and the pretty sounding Indian background music added to the fantastic ambience.Open 7 days:Lunch: 11:30am--3pmDinner: Sun-Thurs 5pm--9pm             Fri-Sat 5pm--10pmThis amazing Indian restaurant will be enjoyed as romantic, intimate, classy, trendy, family outing, business meeting, more!

Triple 2's Tavern=Came here for the second time ever the other day and the adorable waitress with tattoos and long, pretty hair walked up to me with a sweet smile and confirmed that I wanted a margarita on the rocks.  I was in utter disbelief that she remembered my drink order from the one other time I'd been in, a couple of weeks prior, but I guess somehow she did.  Plus the margarita was delicious, and perfectly mixed.  Very impressive service!
Smashburger=Hey come on now, Smashburger isn't THAT bad.At least, this one was better than the one I had in Irvine. Ugh. It's true though, first impressions are important. And for the one in Irvine in Socal, that one made me just be like wtf is this. But in the Forum Food Court in Caesar's Palace, I decided that I try Smashburger. Looking back, I should have tried Earl of Sammiches or something else not accessible/not eaten by me, but it was late, I needed dinner at 9.30pm, and this was the first thing I saw in the food court.First off, really nice service. I was greeted by the cashier and asked how my day was. Heck, most of the places today, you aren't asked that, and as a visitor to a city, you get to enjoy that more to explain that you're from out of town and that you're all giddy with your Fat Tuesday cup that you got from just down the Forum Shops and that you're now hungers. I got the original, which didn't look cold, which actually looked palatable, didn't have a lot of oil, didn't look like a menace. It looked edible. A plus. It tasted decently enough like a burger would be, but you know it's fast food, not the gourmet burgers that you get.It came out FAST. It took within a MINUTE from ordering to getting it to actually get the burger. I don't know what to say about that tho xDPrices seemed higher for some odd reason, ($7-8), which seems kinda high for a burger.. Hmmm.
Southern Table=Don't do it. Just don't. Tiny crabs, looked like sand crabs, or maybe and STD left unchecked way to long. My fingers hurt from trying to eat them. My tummy is rumbling... we'll just have to see how tomorrow goes, but I may be ill. Dry, dry cake. It's all just like pieces of a bad dream. Just use your better judgment and never eat here. No matter how drunk you are. If you can't resist a good time of awful overpriced food, head over to the Seigal Suites and give yourself a little punishment.If you really hate yourself, order the crab. Hey, it was an experience, that's for sure.Even though I would not classify the service as good, the waitress was a very nice person. (Is that what you say right before you break up with someone?)Enjoy!
Super Burrito=So I see a new spot at the end of the strip called super burrito... Let's just say that I am SUPER disappointed!!!!! Let's start from the time I walked in there were two people flirting with each other, I then started to ask about prices to which the female didn't know.  She began to take my order and then all of a sudden was interrupted by a  kiddie shoving match flirting session again while I stood there and waited  to complete my order. So I ended up paying $9.04 on top of the $0.45 debit card charge whatever no biggie. I was excited because when you go to Baja they give you a full plate. But when I look at my to-go plate which was not even a full size to go plate it was not even full it was a little over half full. I reached out to the cook and asked him is this all I get for over $9. He said yes.  I asked for a little more, he said "no". I informed him that this was disappointing and that I would not come back. He responded with "that's fine" in Spanish.  I was shocked at the response so I informed him I will now leave a review about this place. Again responding with "that's fine". At that time I requested my money back.  it usually takes a lot for me to write a negative review but this place was horrible unprofessional/ portions were small/ employees don't know their own product and they are too busy horsing around and flirting. I will never be back and will make sure I spread the word.
Duck Donuts=There was a lot of anticipation waiting for this place to open. Everyone loves a good gourmet donut and the Charlotte scene has been seriously lacking them. It is located in that little pocket of shops between Kenilworth and the East Blvd Harris Teeter (behind Menchies)Duck Donuts is a little more simplistic than I was expecting.You have one type of base donut.  You then choose the type of icing you want. Off the top of my head, there were about 8-10 choices. I chose one with Orange icing and one with maple icing.  Next you chose a topping to go on each donut. I think there were only five options here. I went with chocolate sprinkles on my orange iced donut and bacon on my maple iced donut. They also had coconut, peanuts and regular sprinkles.There are about 40-50 different combinations you can make between icing and toppings. The ones I had were pretty delicious. They also came out fresh. My donuts were still hot when I got home with them five minutes later.Ultimately I was not blown away to the point of now having to fight the urge to return, but they were very good and a great new place to grab breakfast. I'll be back for sure but think I can limit this to a once a month place instead of a once a week need.Doughnuts are certainly a treat to be held (and eaten) on specifically special occasions. Or, in the case of Duck Donuts, any time the urge befalls your day. Having good, nay, fantastic doughnuts in the hood is something that is somewhat of a foreign concept to Charlotte, for the most part. You've got your larger brands with plenty of presence, but having a smaller company show up in good ol' Crown Town is a welcome sight. Now, doughnuts are not too difficult to make acceptable in most doughnut-eaters' eyes. Serve em warm, slathered with glaze, and not much else. You're on your merry way to a great day when hot doughnuts are thrown in the mix. Duck Donuts is doing it right. Though, their process is pretty unique from others. First of all, the menu is rather simple. Doughnuts, coffee, a few breakfast sandwiches, and a few other things here and there. You order your doughnuts from the counter by singles or by the dozen, they are prepared on-the-spot, and served at the other end of the counter. The apparatus that forms and fries the doughnuts is so rad. It's a automatic dispenser that drops the perfectly formed doughnuts into the oil and then moves them along a conveyor belt. It's unlike any other I've seen. They do happen to have two of these guys for when the lines get longer and they need to crank out more fried dough. Note: ALL of their doughnuts are of the same base. (Cake Doughnuts) I.e. Not a yeast-based recipe. They are actually rather light and possess a perfect amount of crunch on the exterior. Not super heavy and dense like some other cake doughnuts of the world.  So far, we've tried a handful --LemonCinnamon SugarGlazedPeanut ButterStrawberryBy far, the glazed wins every single time. It's just so perfect and easy. Eat them warm or after a few hours and they retain the same flavor and texture. I'm sure heating them in the oven wouldn't be a bad call either. Very impressed with these guys. Their varieties of doughnuts will certainly win over tons of local Dilworth eating talent and I'm sure we'll plan on many a visit in the near future. Welcome to the 'hood, Duck Donuts!A donut is a donut, is a cake, is a pancake. (A tribute to my favorite scene from Girl, Interrupted.)I successfully avoided donuts for 6 months, only to be taken down 2wks ago in one fell swoop during an intense 2 day event where unlimited free donuts were available. Returned to Charlotte and haven't slowed down. That 'famine-feast' thing I guess.So, Duck Donuts. Mentioned to the cheerful woman at the counter it was my first time. She gave me the run down (which of course I quietly already knew, being an informed yelper) and it was showtime. Despite the warnings of excessive oiliness from other reviews, ordered both a maple & a chocolate coconut. She spied my donut lust, so offered at no charge one that came out too small to sell. Hell f***ing yeah. Chose vanilla.While I awaited my order, dove in to the gift. Warm, moist, pleasing. The other two arrived, and the maple RULED. At one point, I felt like I was eating hot pancakes. Thick & cakey.I did observe something, which is more of a note to management than anything else. The card machine was down, so cardholders were asked to leave their card numbers for processing later. One particular patron was visibly uncomfortable with this arrangement but agreed. The nice woman at the counter did try to run the transaction several times, but the system remained stubborn. Thinking the woman was just buying 1 donut, I began to offer to pay, but she had a whole box and I only had $3 cash left. The woman even doubled back before she left and asked the clerk to ensure her card info would be destroyed. All I could think was "just give her the da*n donuts!". I mean, what, it would have set them back, what, $12??? Plus, the store was closing in 15min anyway. The woman was clearly concerned, and a man eventually came out from back, who seemed managerial. It would have been an enormous act of customer appreciation and bred tremendous brand loyalty to just give her the donuts at no charge, thank her for her patience, and apologize for the delay. After the 2.5 donuts I ate, did feel slightly nauseous. Only one next time.
Snooze=Why didn't I order extra pancakes to take home for lunch??! I got the pumpkin pancake, half order, and they were amazing. Besides pumpkin spice, they used seasoned pumpkin seeds and a cream cheese butter spread for pure mouth watering delight. On all of their pancake options (of which there are about ten tantalizing varieties) you can opt to make them gluten free. Woo hoo!The style of the restaurant was bright and cheery. They packed many people on the patio and inside but somehow it didn't feel overcrowded. It was a delight just to be present in such an upbeat and buzzy type of place.Why the four stars? Our server was great- pleasant, confident, friendly, knowledgable but it took a really long time to get our bill and then get it processed at the end. That may not have been enough to take it from five to four stars but on top of it we had to move the bench slightly and discovered a full pancake on the ground. Not really their fault if they couldn't see it, but kind of gross to have it down there for the meal.Those last points are so minor that I would never hold it against them. I eagerly look forward to our next visit. I fully intend to dive into one of their egg Benedict specialties next time!
Golden China=New Chinese spot- layout and menu indicate that they specialize in lunch specials and takeout, but food quality was better than your average mom-and-pop take on Panda Express. Food is fresh and the menu has more options than expected, including boba drinks and a $2 spam musubi, but dishes are of the more Americanized style that is all too easy to find elsewhere.Lunch specials are around $7, while dinner specials are $9, but I opted to try the lettuce wraps- available in chicken, shrimp, vegetable, or combination. I found it odd this dish was listed in the "Chef Specialties" section, but the $9 portion I received was enough for two meals- several lettuce leaves, more than enough filling, and a giant heap of rice, too.Note that though they highlight their takeout and low prices, but food is cooked to order and it can take a bit longer than you might expect. Consider calling ahead if you're in a hurry.
Steamie Weenie=Yes, the name is funny. Steamie Weenie is a no frills just good old-fashioned hot dogs with all the tasty fixings! It's like a bun filled to the top with pure Americana!Must orders, The Tucson and the Nor'Wester. The Tucson is a bacon-wrapped dog with pinto beans, tomato, diced onions, tomatillo lime salsa, yellow mustard, and mayonnaise. Yeah, it was mess and it was delicious. The layers of flavor were fantastic, the perfect mix of spicy, salty, citric amazingness.  You like a da spicy? You're going to love da Nor'Wester! This... cream cheese, griddled onions, scallions, fresh jalapeño peppers, and Sriracha. It's has a kick trust me, I was sweating while enjoying this bad boy. Tater Tot lover? Order the fully loaded tots and you'll be a happy camper. Tots, bacon, and cheese, you're welcome. My only beef SW are the buns. I'd like a sturdier bun, they tend to fall apart when you're only halfway done eating your weenie. Also, how about buns that match the dog? Order a Nor'Westrer, get it on a jalapeno and cheese bun or an "everything" bun for the Everything Bagel Dog? Just a weenie thought for great weenie spot.Gourmet hotdogs are a trend many people would like to see die already. Lucky for this spot, I am not one of those people. The weird name, cute logo, low prices, and a wide variety of menu offerings make this place a hot-diggity darn good spot. Follow them on social media to find out about their off-menu specials, such as the Run, Run, Rudolph dog for December: reindeer sausage topped with caramelized onions and sriracha cream. Simple but super tasty, it took a lot of effort to share this with my guy.Solid menu standbys include the Everything Bagel dog (w/cream cheese and scallions) and the Japanese-inspired Mt. Fuji dog (teriyaki onions, nori, carrots, scallions, wasabi mayo). Don't even get me started on side options (tot-chos, anyone?!).Location is cozy, service is genuinely friendly, and they even have a condiment bar to doctor up your dog with extra hot sauces and mustards. Don't forget about their house fry sauce and beer cheese!
Kangchen Indian Cuisine=Probably more like 3-point something stars based on two visits for the lunch buffet (they just opened a few weeks ago).  However, I'll round it up to 4 stars based on the fact that they actually have some appropriately SPICY food available at the buffet (there's plenty of non-spicy as well-- chicken tikka masala, palak paner, etc), and because both times I've been there both the main selections as well as the desserts have had things that you don't see at all of the  other Indian buffets nearby. At this point I'd probably compare Kangchen favorably against Dhaba and Swagat, and a step up from Maharaja and Minerva (all about a 5 minute drive from this place, so there's pretty stiff competition nearby!)
The Rice Shop=Formerly a dismal-at-best fried rice counter, The Rice Shop is a serious upgrade and a welcome new business in this up-and-coming plaza! Rice bowls sound so simple, but they're comforting, fresh, and hit just the right spot when done well.Menu has about five different bowls, each with their own protein and complementary sauces, all with rice and veggies. The Mochiko Chicken Bowl is the only one I've tried so far and it was great- generous portion of fresh, juicy chicken with a great sauce, crisp veggies, and a scoop of rice. So long as you go in knowing it's mochiko influenced and not some strictly-authentic version of the dish, you should enjoy it. There are a few sides available, one being a salad with a choice of three house-made dressings (black sesame vin was my favorite.) Owner and Chef Tony is a treasure- I accidentally came just after close, but he opened up, let me in, and made my tasty dinner. He's charming and chatty and has some great plans for this place. I'll be coming back to try their Shrimp Bayou and porkbelly bowls soon!
Spicy Tang=EDIT: It appears that the restaurant owners (or somebody else affiliated with the business) have taken to writing fake shill reviews in a pathetic attempt to manipulate their overall rating. Notice that all of the 5-star reviews are by users with only 1 or 2 reviews. They probably gave one another most of their useful/funny/cool votes. In fact, Gabrielle Y.'s original review was removed by the Yelp admin, but a new one was posted IMMEDIATELY (literally within a few minutes). I urge my fellow Yelpers to read everything carefully and decide for yourself which ones to trust.My original review is below:--Wow, I haven't been this disappointed in a long time. My fiancée and I had been excited about coming here since we first saw the signage outside last month, and we finally came today (a Saturday), around 11:30 AM. The first thing we noticed is how disorganized the place is; they were busy training a new employee and none of the others was dealing with the line of customers waiting to order. The place wasn't super busy, maybe a dozen people eating and 4 others in line ahead of us.The way this place works: ingredients are separated into meats (which include fish, shrimp, etc.), vegetables, and "mixed meats" (fish balls and quail eggs). You tell them which ingredients you want, they put them all in a bowl, and cook in a soup with your broth of choice. Meats are $2 each, vegetables $1, mixed meats $1.50. While the concept is fine, the poor organization here means ordering is very inefficient. The staff are Chinese and so are we, but they didn't know the names of several items we asked for. I imagine it would be even more confusing for English speakers. They don't have a large quantity of the ingredients on the counter, so they are constantly running out of things and running to replace with a new batch. They also failed to keep track of what ingredients we ordered, and we had to help them add it up. All in all, ordering was a messy ordeal and I don't want to imagine how they handle the crowds during busier times. Personally, I think they should let customers fill their own bowl and pay by weight (like most similar places in China), or a fixed price per bowl (like the Mongolian grill type places in America). By charging different prices for different ingredients they may be squeezing out better profit margins, but at the cost of poor operating efficiency. I also think they should call your number and have you pick up your order at the counter, rather than trying to bring it to your table, which they can't find and end up constantly calling out numbers anyways. At the very least, they should let customers get their own chopsticks, napkins, and cups of water - it's yet another extra burden on the already disorganized staff. We asked for "slightly spicy" broth but what we got lit our mouths on fire. I don't know if they misheard or just don't have anything less spicy, but keep that in mind. They don't give you white rice, so make sure you order enough for the soup. My tongue was completely numb so I can't comment much about how the food tastes. But my fiancée had stomach cramps during the drive back home, and ended up getting sick. Overall, it seems that the owners didn't do sufficient preparation before opening the restaurant. They should have had the staff properly trained and rethought their operation procedures. As of right now, the place is a complete mess, which is a bad sign for a place that just opened and should have had things planned out. I won't come back because of the food poisoning, but in any case I would urge them to consider adopting the self-serve model of several other nearby eateries (Spoon House, Sushi Ichiban, etc.). It would significantly speed things up while not adding to their costs.--To summarize, I have to agree with the person who wrote the first review. I saw their ads a few months ago and was very excited. My husband and I gave it a try two days ago, and I have to say that I'm very disappointed about the food they offered. First, what you may want to know: I came from Sichuan, China where Chinese style spicy hot pot was originated from. What this restaurant's supposed to offer, spicy tang, is basically a fast food version of hot pot: you ordered food and they'd cook it for you. The most important factors for a good spicy tang are (1) plenty of choices of the food you can choose, and (2) the food has to be fresh and cooked just about right so it remains crunchy.Unfortunately, what this restaurant actually offers is none. Their choices of food are few and are frozen food that you can easily find at a Chinese/Korean grocery store. They don't offer potato slices, seaweed, or sweet potato noodles, which are considered must-haves in spicy tangs and they not hard to be found in Asian grocery stores. Their lotus root slices are basically frozen ones and taste horrible; they don't even bother to buy fresh lotus roots and cut them by themselves. To be honest, I think everyone can cook the exact food by themselves using the ingredient they can easily find in Asian grocery stores and don't need to spend $15+ at this place.I would suggest the owner to be more serious about opening a restaurant business. At least prepare fresh food and don't just buy frozen ones from super market. Also, I'm not sure whether the owner is aware of this, but the hot pot ingredients brought in Asian stores may contains pork or cow fat. I'd suggest you clearly mark it so that vegetarians or people with religious beliefs won't accidentally ate it.Food taste= spicy only with no other flavorsFood amount= e.g for two dollars, you are getting only three pieces of frozen sliced beef. No rice provided Food diversity= very limited. Food quality= not sure if the food was fresh or cooked appropriately, but my stomach was not happy after the mealService= unorganized, not just a little bitI noticed that there are three positive reviews came out the same day same hour, and I think as a true customer, I should write a real review here to let people know. I hope the owner of Spicy Tang will take care of their business more seriously!
FireRock Steakhouse Las Vegas=New to the Centennial area and near to my house for food intake. We went late last night and sat at the bar. Bartenders were great and helpful. Service was fast and the food was good. The only reason I wouldn't go more often is because of the music. It's all country. And yes, I really do not like the newer style country that much. Enough for it to hinder me from eating at a particular location. The food was good. Not my favorite, but it was good. And it's awesome that this place is open until 2am. Centennial doesn't have a ton of late night options. La food:Their rolls. Good god alive, the rolls are amazing. Blue Cheese Wedge - yummy blue cheese dressing with crispy onions and cherry tomatoes. Stuffed Mushrooms - very good. The only thing is I wish they would put more crab and less mayonnaise. Prime Rib - Pretty good. Rare as it comes as requested. The sauce and the horseradish was tasty.Filet Oscar - Merh. This was my least favorite. The filet was good, but the asparagus was not and the bearnaise sauce wasn't tasty either. I ordered the white cheese mashed potatoes with my meal. And they were not good. Not creamy, dry and had no taste. The bartender told us that they had a really rough opening and the cooks were not really prepared. So maybe that's why the food isn't the best. I'm willing to wait a couple of months and go again.I've been waiting to try this restaurant for a while now and have been really looking forward to it. Called for Thursday 6pm reservations, was told they have a "wait list" they can add me to, but don't take reservations? Odd, but ok. I immediately received a text saying we've been added. Cool stuff. We arrived and had about a 5 minute wait for out table. The restaurant has a great vibe, nice decorations and you can smell the wood fires. Really liking this place! Soon after we sat, we realized this place has serious issues. We sat for at least 10 minutes before anyone came to bring water, ask for drinks etc. I saw several servers running like headless chickens. I also saw what I think were 1 perhaps 2 managers strolling around doing nothing like they didn't have a worry in the world. The menu is great, lots of great choices.  I really wanted to try several items.We ordered finally and got a pan of great bread dropped on the table. Waited another 5 minutes and finally called someone over so we could get silverware and napkins.  At least something to spread butter with. Things aren't looking good.Our waiter came finally and took our order. We then sat there for 35 minutes before seeing him again before our dinners arrived. Now we're so agitated it doesn't matter if the food is great or not. We've been here going on an hour still waiting...on a Thursday! Got our dinners, finished them, waited another 10 minutes, bussed our own dishes, asked for the check and left. Won't even comment on food as the entire experience was ruined by the total lack of service in what is hoping to be a mid-to high end steak house.Just so disappointed in this place, we really need more choices in the N.W. but Fire Rock will not be around long unless they get their act together.It might just be me, but when you step into FireRock, it feels like you're literally walking into the one and only Shenanigans. This place has the cookie cutter chain restaurant feeling down to a science. From the cheesy decor trying to look like an upscale steakhouse, to the terrible service from waiters who obviously don't want to be there, and the mediocre and overpriced food, it's like you're on the set of a movie...We sat down here for dinner this past Sunday night at around 5:30. With it being fairly new to an area with otherwise almost no good restaurants, I thought it would be much busier than it was. After all was said and done, I could see why it wasn't. Honestly, it's surprising to me that people would come here more than once, but I guess that's what keeps all these chain restaurants alive and kicking.When it comes to the menu here, it looks small at first, but has a whole bunch of options. I just really don't get those options. FireRock Steakhouse is supposed to specialize in steaks (it's in their name), yet they only have a few cuts of meats...with the rest of the menu having everything from street tacos to a monte cristo. Maybe the concept is just over my head, but their menu literally has about a quarter of a page featuring steaks, and that's it.Because it is a steakhouse, of course I wanted to try their steak. I ended up deciding on the Cajun-Spiced Ribeye, which for whatever reason is $2 more than their regular ribeye. The only difference it it's supposed to have cajun spices, which I think to them only means cayenne and paprika, and then some "Creole Butter". I'm almost positive they just use the exact stuff sold in a jar that goes by that name, and that's where they are getting the $2 up-charge from. You might have guessed it by now, but this steak was nowhere near worth it's $26 price tag. I requested it medium-rare and it was overcooked. Very little marbling in the meat, not much fat or flavor, and a really thin cut. You can see from my picture that there was virtually no juice from the meat on the plate, and it stayed that way even after being cut into. Any juicy was likely from the jarred Creole Butter anyway.What made FireRock even worse is the service. I realize they are still pretty new, but they've been open almost 2 months now. You'd think they'd have a good amount of the kinks worked out, but that just isn't the case. Our waiter looked like he was in hell, and every time he'd fill a drink cup, he'd slam the cup on the table like he was taking out his aggression on my poor iced tea. I'd say thank you, he'd walk away without saying a word. We had to ask for things more than once, and just to get some bread took 10 minutes. He just didn't really seem to care to be there at all.And while maybe not directly his fault, our salads took almost 30 minutes to come out, with our main entrees taking just over an hour. With our small party of 6, and the restaurant pretty slow overall, it shouldn't have taken nearly that long. To add fuel to the fire, my wife ordered a filet cooked medium, yet it came out much closer to medium-rare and was basically cold to the touch.As I said, I'm not sure what FireRock is going for. A menu that's all over the place with crap service and mediocre, overpriced food is a recipe for disaster. The good thing they have going for them is they are maybe 1/2 a step-up from an Outback, and are surrounded by other crappy restaurants. For people who constantly frequent mediocre chain restaurants, this might be a welcome addition...for everyone else, methinks not. "Eat somewhere else, enjoy your food".I wanted to give a good review, I'm sorry I can't. When we walked in the door, we were instantly confused. The atmosphere is of a high end steakhouse, but there are enough loud tv's to be a sports bar. With all the sports bars and sports books here, no one would come here to watch a game... and they kill the steakhouse feel. When we went to the bar while waiting on our table. The service was slowww. The bartender ignored us. We were helped by the service-tender, between him filling orders for the waitresses.Our booth was nice and comfortable for 4 people, but the table was small.  The salads were good, but slow arriving. So, of course, the meal arrived way too soon. I HATE THAT. So do you forget the salad and start eating the hot food, or finish the salad and eat a cold steak? Or send the food back to sit under a heatlamp? And remember the small table?!!!!!!Person #1- the pasta was boring.Person #2- the burger and mushrooms were overlooked.Person #3- the steak was flavorless and tasted microwaved.Person #4 (me)- the bacon filet was small. Cut several times on the edge (obviously checking for done-ness). Dry and rubbery. And it looked smaller than it actually was because there was no garnish to fill the blank area of the large plate (O platter presentation).The waitress did come check on us several times, but NEVER prebused, even though I DID and used plates were stacked! Did I mention the small table?My friend ordered a vodka martini at the bar, very nice presentation. When he ordered his second at the table, it was a shot of vodka in a cocktail glass with his olives carried separately in her other hand. Well, we were all so overit by this point, he just poured the shot in his empty martini glass and tossed in the olives.When we want a high-end lounge, we will go elsewhere....When we want a steakhouse, we will go elsewhere...When we want a sportsbar, we will go elsewhere...I generally don't care to haggle over service issues in a  dining establishment but when I do its usually with someone who is a very poor excuse for a F and B manager! Party of 6 walks in- place is swamped and very understaffed its very noticeable when your seated waiting 30 minutes to give a drink order.. Great! Order for drinks is in and we even get an appetizer ordered! 15 minutes for drinks to come to table and then 40 minutes for a spin dip That you've asked about twice since receiving drinks... Now nobody comes back for 45 minutes to take food order or give drink refills.. When the order comes out its wrong and we don't complain because who wants to wait for an additional 45 minutes to eat dinner. The topper.. sandwich comes out served with no bread because cook dropped the pizza bread on ground and now there's no more to offer... total joke was that when the manager comes to the table he has no idea how to deal with 6 aggrivated patrons. Get a real manager who knows how to schedule servers! Sad this is a nice place the NWest  needs this place and it's horrible. 3 times we've visited and each time the service was worse than the last. They need a rescue for sure.. We aren't in WY. We are in Las Vegas and we know what service is!!! Total dining time 4 hours! On a six top the corp should have had 2.5 tabkes in and out.. Fair warning local patrons!! I don't care how yummy the food was one time- poor management is a deal breaker..Today was the first and last time my husband and I will go here. The food was pretty good when my husband and I finally got it. (That's the only reason why they got 2 stars) We waited over an hour and 15 mins to get our meal. Sad to say their colossal potato wasn't "colossal"as they claimed. The waitress apologized for the wait and there was a mix up in the back. She said that the meal would be comped and a Manager would come over to check on us. We almost walked out just before the waitress came by to tell us about the mix up, but because the meal was being cooked and was being comped we hesitantly stayed. We did not complain or make a stink, because we understand things happen. Then we got our food, the Manager stopped by and wanted to see if there was anything else he could get us. Thinking that we already have the meal comped we didn't want to take advantage of the generosity and told him that there was nothing else we wanted or needed. Then we get the bill and it was not comped like the waitress stated earlier. Instead they took $14 off the bill. We will not be back. And I would suggest that they not lie to their customers.Came here last night for some late dinner and to try out the food again. We like to sit at the bar and we had the same bartender as last time. He is great. Super friendly, helpful and very on top of ordering the food and bringing it out. We ordered the sampler platter, salads and the Blue cheese burger. A lot of food...yes. The sampler platter was okay. I like the stuff mushrooms, but the rest was alright. The Blue cheese burger here is super good. The ONLY thing I would change is the bread. It's very spongeyish. I would like to have softer bread, but the patty itself is awesome. Happy to come back and try out some other stuff. But again - the music. Good god, it's horrible here. Last night, it was 80's...and not the good 80's music. Also, it was super cold. It had to be on like 65 degrees and we were freezing. I'm always cold and my boyfriend is always hot. And if he's cold, you know it's got to be freezing.
Café Venosa=OK. I did NOT know this type of cafe existed in North America. My friend and I were looking for a place to get work done in Montreal when we stumbled across this cafe. With a giant cat symbol on the window, I thought it was only cat themed. But then I saw a live cat resting by the window, and that was the end of my search for a cafe. Walking inside, it was perfect. The large tables for work, free Wifi, cute ambience, availability of food and snacks, and 4-5 cats, some kittens. Smitten with kittens. They have some little toys and stairs for these little critters as well as feeding time, where they let the guests give the cats some snacks. I have to say that I probably could have gotten more work done, but who cares when there are kittens around. They are really friendly, and where my cat would probably claw you to death for a belly rub, the ones here are decidedly docile. As for the food, it's a vegan place, meaning you get a choice of soy or almond milk to go with your coffee. The coffee itself was OK. The flat white was excellent. The tempeh wrap was decent (I originally wanted the quiche, but they were out). The parfait and caprese sandwich were also great.It's a great and unique experience. 5-stars!
Larsen's Grill - Galleria Mall=I wavered between 3 and 4 stars.  Here's why... Service and wait time were phenomenal- 5 stars, but our food ranged from 2-5 stars.I made a reservation on Open Table, and we were seated immediately in a nice elevated booth.  Our server arrived right behind the hostess to take our drink order.  The beer came out in a pretty awesome glass I dubbed a punch bowl and they had the clearest (uncloudy) iced tea I have ever seen.  Both were cold and delicious.  We started with fantastic salads that are large enough to share: WEDGE SALAD $9- Egg, tomatoes, bacon, candied pecans, bleu cheese crumbles and bleu cheese dressing.  Don't tell Fleming's but this is better than their wedge salad! CHOP SALAD $8-Romaine and iceberg, hearts of palm, artichoke hearts, bacon, avocado, tomatoes, jack cheese, chopped egg and garbanzo beans tossed in champagne vinaigrette.  Simply delicious.  Lots of different flavors in each bite.Entrees: PRIME RIB 12oz with garlic mashed $34-the garlic mashed was creamy and flavorful, but the prime rib was very cold when it arrived, fattier than we expected, and slightly overcooked.  They offered to reheat it and it was marginally better, but the flavor was just not that good.  I am not sure if it was a bad cut of meat or an off night, but I don't think it is something we'd order again to find out.PRIME DRY AGED FILET 8oz with a loaded baked potato $49- the filet was utterly fantastic; a buttery melt in your mouth bliss that I kept eating far after I should have stopped.  Sadly (or luckily since I was full), the potato was pointless.  It was bland and undercooked.  I also ordered a side of broccoli that looked amazing, but was also undercooked.  Very hard.  I wanted a dinner veggie; not crudités.Desserts: CHOCOLATE PEANUT BUTTER CAKE- Very rich, but very good.  The cake was moist and the whipped cream tasted homemade. We took 95% of this cake to go (sans ice cream) but we wanted to try it at the restaurant.APPLE PIE- Omg, I think they stole this recipe from my grandmother!  Devine crisp apples, cinnamon, and not overly sweet.  A winner for sure!Side note; like Fleming's, you can get a $100 gift card at Costco for $79.99.  Built in 20% savings.Lunch at Larsens was Lovely!Located at the Galleria Mall it's an easy find.  We stopped in on a weekend during lunch hours.  It wasnt too busy at all so we were greeted and seated immediately.   There is a very comfortable dining setting.  They have patio dining as well when the weather cools down.  Our waiter was awesome.  He was very professional and attentive.  He had a great understanding of the background of Larsens along with the menu.  I decided to try their stuffed chicken.  It was lightly breaded filled with artichokes, mushrooms, sundried tomatoes and cheese.   The portion size was enormous.  I think they used two large chicken breasts which provided enough for me to have two more leftover meals.  The ingredients gave it a wonderful flavor.  I was happy with the lighter breading as well.   The accompanying sides of mashed potatoes and asparagus were also good.  Again it was a large side of mashed potatoes that I easily shared.   We enjoyed a lovely meal and would be more than happy to come back.Lured over here by Bethany's review, I came for a date night with my guy and was pleasantly surprised to see this upscale steakhouse spot attached to the Galleria mall- complete with valet parking.FILET MIGNON SASHIMI: Surprisingly tasty and imaginative! I have no idea why this spot has sushi on their menu, but this dish bridges the sushi and steak offerings in a clever way with a seared presentation served on a mountain of wasabi potatoes. I enjoyed this way more than I thought I would.CHOP SALAD: Generous portion, easily sharable. Toppings include garbanzo beans, tomatoes, cheese, bacon (maple glazed and spiced with Cayenne?), and avocado. HERB CRUSTED ROASTED CHICKEN BREAST: Despite coming here based on a review for the stuffed chicken breast, I ended up opting for this version. The mushroom cream sauce is delicious, I just wish there was more of it. Portion is huge, given sides are wild rice and glazed carrots. I subbed the mac for the rice since that dish is rarely remarkable anywhere. The carrots were tasty but the glaze gets into every other component and adds an unnecessary maple sweetness to everything it touches. Maybe side these separately.FIVE CHEESE MACARONI: An indulgent baked version with penne pasta, ample creamy sauce included. I'm not generally a fan of baked macs because they tend to be dry, but this version was exceptional. NY STRIP STEAK: Because you gotta order at least one steak at a steak house. Got the wet-aged at the suggestion of our server, it was nicely crusted and cooked to a perfect medium-rare. Side of asparagus was tasty, sauce and other add-ons (bleu cheese, onions, mushrooms, etc.) are unnecessary. Meat was super tender and full of flavor.We were so full even with takeout boxes that we opted against dessert, but they have a large selection. They offer half-off wine by the bottle on Wednesdays, which we may have to come back to try. Note that they also have a selection of wine on tap! Service from Neil was attentive and knowledgeable, with plenty of suggestions- request him specifically.TIP: They have a "piano hour" (their version of HH) with app and drink specials on the patio, lounge, and bar area. Worth a shot for light bites.
Amelie's French Bakery and Café=There seems to be something missing. I was really excited about Amelies coming to South Charlotte. I am in a long, drawn out love affair with their salted caramel brownies - like everyone else in charlotte. The food is ok. I'm currently crunching on a turkey and brie sandwich... but it's just ok. Even the caramel brownie isn't out of this world like I have experienced at the other location. Just something off.This location is more open and easier to navigate. There's a place for a line to form, plenty of seating, and an outdoor patio where the Love Locks live. It's all nice, but there's nothing fancy or "hidden gem" about this place. This isnt the quiet study spot that i expected it to be, but maybe I'm comparing it too much to NoDa? The staff doesn't help much either. I've been here 3 or 4 times and every time I feel like I'm not hip enough - and Lord knows, it could just be me. Haha. When I order at the counter, I feel like I'm interrupting something, or not doing it right. There's not a whole lot of explanation - more "what do you want?". Nah mean?So, I'll continue eating my sandwich and floating on their wifi. I'm not in love with this location like I thought I would be. I think if I didn't know what to expect, and had never heard of Amelie's, it might bring in another star - but only for the unique decorating. It's fine, and I'll come here again for coffee... *womp womp*
Tortilla Fish=I was told that I must go here by another amazing Yelper and boy was he right, this place is amazing! The tacos come plain and then you pack them with toppings from their fabulous salsa bar that has everything that you could ever want on your taco! The bar consists of a ton of salsas, hot sauces, jalapenos, cabbage, slaw, avocado sauce, homemade ranch, tartar sauce, cucumbers, pickles onions,  limes... seriously, you name it, it is there! I ordered their beer battered fish tacos and holy yum, I was in heaven! On Taco Tuesday, it is buy 2 tacos, get 1 free! ...Can't beat that! We may be regulars here very soon!
Carlos Obriens=nah, son. we stopped here on the way to our hotel after our flight from NJ. My colleague said to just pick anything out i saw along the way. I somehow expected ANY Mexican place in Arizona to be good, kinda like in San Diego. Apparently I was wrong. I love carnitas. Our waiter raved about the carnitas there when I expressed my interest. dude was either full of caca or has never had good carnitas in his life. I've never had carnitas so dry before. this place is obviously about serving large portions for low prices - but the quality is lower than the prices. i wasn't even feeling the fried ice cream here. it's not easy to get me to talk negatively about dessert, yo.the Cadillac margarita was okay. and if it weren't for the Frida Kahlo art on the walls I would chalk this experience up as a total loss. Frida gets a star all her own.Oh, saw the end of the Giants/49ers game where the Giants won it in the last few minutes. that was good too.I've had the opportunity to dine at this location twice now.  Service has been quick, place is clean and it's a fairly comfortable Mexican restaurant.  So on the topic of Mexican... I get the Carlos, yet the Obriens.... not so much =).  The top 2 recommend dishes on both visits were the Pollo Fundido and the #13 A Little bit of Everything In Miniature!Sadly, I have had both and they were both just borderline OK for me.  Not much flavor (though decent serving sizes).  I do not understand why it's so hard to find good, especially authentic tasting Mexican food in Arizona?  Sorry C.O. just not a winner for me.  Best to you and the customers that are fans.I'd strongly suggest to spice things up.
