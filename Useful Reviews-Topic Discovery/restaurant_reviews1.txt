Review Text :
Rok is probably one of the dopest joints in phoenix. If your trying to get a girl or guy to make out with you, I  highly suggest going to the down stairs bar and parking near the fire place. The service is awesome, every time I go the bartenders remembers my name, (I love that shit) the music is amazing one minute radiohead the next mgmt, really great stuff. The food is a bit pricey but you get a salad with most meals which is a rare thing these days. So overall Rok is a great spot to impress someone you want to make out with.Tonight, I had a chance to show a brutha some culture.  When someone is taking me to dinner, I pick a place that I *know* is going to be a winner.  Rokerij didn't disappoint!  The parking lot was full, so I started to get scared that we wouldn't be able to get a table or have to *gasp* wait for one.At first, we had gone downstairs to eat there, but it was packed, so we headed to the restaurant.  From previous reviews, I was afraid it would be packed and we would have to find somewhere else to go eat.  I really wanted to impress the guy (HA even though he was buying!) and, luckily, there were a few empty tables upstairs.We were seated at the far end in a corner booth.  Any restaurants with booths get an A+ in my book.  I love sitting close to friends and a booth gives the perfect opportunity.Specials were neatly written on blackboards, but I was at a weird angle to read them.  Chris, our waiter, read them for us and explained each dish.  That was the high point of his service the rest of the night.As we perused the menu, our drink order was taken.  I really wanted to get the small plates and try a few different things, so we both chose 3 each.  I got the crab tostadas.  They were filled to the brim with crab, not too much dressing so the crab flavor wasn't drowned.  I also got the bacon-wrapped grilled shrimp (YUMMY!!!!) and the brie toasts.  Divine!  The cheese was melted perfectly, with just enough of its grease to soak into the bread.  I actually licked my fingers after each one.He got the skewered steak, shrimp on dirty rice and meat tacos.  The rice wasn't all that, but the rest of the dishes were superb!As we ate, and our drinks emptied, we had to call Chris over to get refills.  Not once had he checked on us during the meal.  It's the reason for 4 stars!  I was a bit disappointed in that.  For such a Valley favorite, I had hoped for a little more attention.Ambiance is key at Rokerij.  The smell of the wood-burning fireplace, the cozy booth and warm atmosphere gave me cause to want to go back again.  And, the brutha liked, it too!Knocking a star off for you Rokerij. Believe me, this hurts me more than it hurts you. I visited last Sunday and our service was friendly, but it didn't make up for the poor delivery of food and the problem with solving issues that we had. I have only had the small plates from Rokerij. This trip I decided to try some of their "New Mexican" offerings.  My appetizer order, which was specifically stated to be an appetizer, not an entree came with my entree. Considering the appetizer did not even have to be cooked (steak tartare), that's unacceptable. When I commented on it I got a "Ugh, I know, right?" Um...really? My entree which was the Rokerij sampler was meh. The best part of the dish was the benedict. The enchiladas were bland and plain old mush.  I had dinner with my best friend Amber, and my good friend Ayesha. Ayesha had me sample her enchiladas as she has specifically asked that she not be served pork. I bit into a bite of pork enchilada off of Ayesha's plate. When the waiter was flagged down, he said "Hm, not sure what to do about this." Really?? Luckily, before I went off like a powder keg, he offered to remake them. He didn't comp anything for the obvious mistakes that were made. I hope he realized that there were some boo-boos made when he saw his tip was so small. I hope to give back the star I just took away, but they're going to have to wow me to do that. It's too bad that this trip was so disappointing.We went on a double date the other night to Rokerij.  Funny I'd been wanting to go to Rokerij for a while now, and when we finally pulled up, I realized that I had been before!  (I guess I'm getting old or something and really losing it... I actually had been there once before when I first moved to AZ, not realizing what the name of the place was).I called to make a reservation a few days before the date and was told they could accommodate our group at upstairs, but not down unless we wanted to wait until 9:00.  Alright then... 7:00 upstairs worked!We were celebrating our engagement and our friends' being pregnant, and we had the perfect booth; kind of a half circle shape.  Lindsay was our waitress and took good care of us.  The atmosphere is dark but warm and cozy... perfect to walk into on a cold night!We decided to start with a few of the small plates to start... (both guys in our group are big eaters). They let me choose one of them and I chose the stuffed mushrooms - they are stuffed with crab meat and were delicious.  They also chose the spareribs (which I tasted and were quite tasty) and the bacon wrapped scallops.  For entrees, Jared and I took advantage of the $36 special which included our choice of meet, 2 salads, and 2 side items.  I chose the entrecote and probably would not choose that again.  It's a bone-in ribeye and was way too fatty... we enjoyed our spinach and Rokerij salads and our sides of broccoli and asparagus.  I probably could've just had the small plates and salad and been just fine.  We took home leftover meat for Minnie, so she was a happy dog that night!Instead of ordering dessert, we walked next-door to DQ - can't go wrong with that!Overall, I'd say our experience was 3.5 but I'll round up for now because Lindsay was a great waitress and we had fun with our friends.  I'll overlook the fact that one of the bussers spilled steak juice on me when delivering our entree... I won't rush back but I'll keep Rokerij in mind for future gatherings with small groups.Sadly, I am forced to agree with Leslie M who wrote on 4/10. This was one of my favorite places to visit, to introduce newcomers to, treat family and friends, and for a time I'd visit once every two months or so. My previous three visits have not gone so well; I'll relate my latest visit which took place just over a week ago. A friend attempted to make reservations for two on a Thursday. He was told that due to a policy change by  Richardson, a reservation for two on a Thursday could no longer be taken, as there was disappointment that their business for tables of 4 or more were suffering. Okay, I can understand, business decisions have to be made, but cut your nose off to spite your face? However, the woman that answered the phone let us know there should be no problem getting a table. I was seated shortly before my friend arrived so I had a chance to look over the menu. To my surprise, some changes have been made. First, a salad choice (and they're all very typically very yummy), anyway, a choice is no longer offered. Instead, the house salad is offered at $4 with the entree purchase. Next, a statement is now printed across the top of the menu letting the patron know "you order it, you bought it"...is this REALLY necessary? While the server and busboy were friendly and helpful (my water glass was never empty), my $4 house salad arrived about 90 seconds before our entrees did. Oh, the accompanying bread was hard as stone and arrived with my salad, while an attentive server should have brought it along just after our drinks were served, as my dinner partner hadn't ordered a salad. Oh, my friend, he's typically a big fan of the Steak Rokerij, and absolutely loves the crab/hollandaise sauce mixture. As normal, he asked for more sauce. On this visit, we found $10 added to the check for that request. We found that unusual for Rokerij. Things have certainly changed. I was willing to overlook these changes, after all, the economy is poor these days. I excused myself to use the men's room. After all, we did have Chimay (Rokerij has never had a wide beer selection). I found the towel basket to be so PACKED with paper-towels, I couldn't get one out of the basket, which is on a vanity so small, when you turn the water on, the towels become soaked. This explains the stained, linen towel basket liner...the stains were grays and greens. Overall, I feel that these things add up to failing to pay attention to detail. It's a shame really. I really hope the best for Richardson and hope Rokerij can return to it's former self.This place is sexy...... woh.This is a review of the downstairs loungey sexy area, not the regular dining area. Is there a regular dining area? huh... don't remember seeing it.Anyway, the "small plates" menu is divine like jesus. I'm not kidding. The Beef Tenderloin Toasts were as much of a religious experience as I'll allow myself to have. The Ahi Tuna with wasabi salsa *blush* caused me to mush mouth the words "ohhhh muhhh gawww" while I was still chewing my food. I don't do that. Ever. It's just nasty. The Blue Crab Tostadas were light and refreshing, the perfect compliment to the rich tenderloin. The wine... let's just say I like me some wine. The only complaint I have is that the bartender needed a trim. Seriously... his hipster do was getting in his line of vision and anytime we needed anything I had to flash him to get his attention. Okay, not really but you get the point. In closing: This place will make you forget what you were fighting about. Trust me on that. :)The endDear reader.... Before you decide if this place is great... think about what else you consider great.  When you were 17 and you took a date to Olive Garden, okay, you get a pass.  BUT, if you ever ever ever went on a date to Outback, or Red Lobster... just stop right now.  You will think this place is just amaaaaazing.  So come out, enjoy their food and on the way home jump out into traffic. (Please do that behind me, so as not to make me late to work.)Okay, that said... This place struggles from an identity crisis.  Rokerij, who are you appealing to?  The fools that think that this is a classy joint because their previous best date was to Applebees?  OR are you a really good place?  This place should not have a $12 chicken sandwich with fries on the same menu as a $43 steak.  Choose one direction and stick with it.  I called up at 6pm on a Saturday, first available reservation was for 9pm.  This is a good sign.  I take the reservation and then went for a hair cut at Urban Hair... see my other review, they rule.We get to Rokerij at 830ish.  I walk in the door, and apologize to the staff who are clearly at a waiter station.  We must have walked in the side door.  Whoops!   No, thats the front.  Wait, what?  A friggin computer screen and some silverware, thats the front?  No no, it cant be... oh yes.  Yes, this is phoenix.  Yes, this is the front.  Okay, okay... im cool... whatever.  We will be downtstairs having a drink.The bar downstairs is okay.  Some 50 yr old dude trying to flirt with a 20something girl.   Standard.   We have martinis.  Not bad, the bartender made it okay.  Chopin vodka.  He didnt really know what to do with the vermouth, but it was okay.  I chat with my friend, we are sitting on a couch, its pretty fun so far.  A server comes down and says, "your table is ready"  Cool.  We stand up.  She goes over and starts talking to the 50yr old male cougar and his little cub.  We wait.... finally i walk over to her.  AH HEM... should we just go upstairs?  She turns  "yep, i said it was ready."  Oooooh no.  You had better walk my ass right up to my table.  Nope, i can already tell the service is going to be abysmal.  We walk upstairs.  We wait there for almost 5 min.  Then i grab a bus boy and in broken espanol, i ask him... neccecitamos una mesa... ya dig?  He starts wiping down a table.  I ask my date... why the hell do we have reservations again?  Then as we are being seated, a hostess girl says, "oh your table is over here"  WELLL princess, thanks so much for telling me that 10 min ago....  and we sit. The waitress comes over and says "what can i get ya?"  Excuse me Maude... what is this a diner?  Can i get a slice a pie and a glass of manners?  I ask her what her name is... i then introduce myself and start to read some of the specials off of the wall.  She gets the hint.  I hate my decision to come here.  We order more martinis... Vodka might make this better. We order some specials... i get meat, lots of it.  The food is very good, though pricey.  Im still annoyed that there is a $10 cheeseburger on the menu.  Dont get me wrong, i love a PBR and a Burger... just not what i was expecting after all of the reviews i read.  When the time comes to order dessert, i think to myself... seriously, lets just stop at starbucks.  We get our check.  The bottom line.  This place has good food, but is not a fancy joint.  If people said, its a decent bar with good food, i would say: "heck yes, 4 stars, just needs some better service."  But they think they are classy, and so does yelp... its not.  Frankly, It shouldnt have anything on the menu over $27.  The service is friggin dreadful.  A half drunk toddler could manage this place better.   That is all...Poo poo on all the naysayers. Rokerij is bad ass, which is why it is always wicked crowded. The ambiance is a teeny bit cowboy, some rustic Flagstaff, some Old-world European, and ALL sexy - grotto staircase leading to dim and plush with roaring fireplaces scattered about. The menu is diverse - plenty of funk and weirdness for the more adventuresome, but some more traditional favorites for your conservative friends. All I care about is that they still make me my beloved veggie quesadillas, bursting with roasted broccolini and corn and filled with just the right amount of cheese, served on a wooden cutting board with two kinds of fresh, flavorful, and just-enough-spicy salsa. It's so good, it keeps me from trying the small plates, which sound scrumptious.I'm not sure where all the bitching and moaning about the service come from. Our last visit here was on a packed and swinging Saturday night where we had to wait an hour for a table. Our server was prompt, attentive, and competent, although some odd comments ("What a good looking table! Are you brother and sister?") left us scratching our heads. The crowd is entertaining as well, although I don't think you'd find me scrounging around for a date. Lots of cougars and cougars-in-training with flashy jewelry and spray on tans. Despite this potentially stiff crowd, the place was lively and everyone seemed to be having a perfectly good time. The crowd may overlap somewhat with the 40th St/Campbell BMW- and Range Rover-driving MILF yuppie sect, but somehow it all seems a lot less pretentious here. The word is that the neighboring DQ is going to be torn down to make room for the rebirthed Richardson's. Woo! Between Rokerij and Richardson's, this corner is going to rival 40th St & Campbell. I can't wait!Things I learned last night:I love unpretentious yet quality service, in a relaxed atmosphere. (she was awesome)I don't like drinking ice water without a straw...yeah yeah, turn your nose up. (work on that) You can split a bottle of wine between 5 people. (please don't ever make me do that again)I have a new crush. (restaurants without windows)Rokerij is fast becoming a new favorite spot of mine. I went out on a limb and ordered the NY Steak, medium rare. It was fantastic. Not a huge fan of the green chilie twice baked potato thing but that's more of a personal taste issue. We all shared the Bacon Wrapped Shrimp and Calamari as appetizers. Both delicious; the sauce served with the Calamari tastes distinctively like Pei-Wei's sweet and sour, though that's not a bad thing. Desert was "Death by Chocolate". I had one bite. One bite was enough. Heavy and rich like fudge...not my thing.All in all a great dining experience. I will be back. Many....many times. They also happen to serve the full Richardson's menu, just the way I remember it. That made the whole table happy although the following is what seals the deal for me:* Sorry we do not provide high chairs or booster seats *yes, it's love.... without the constant arguing :)Rokerij is no Jokerij!Not much new can be written about this amazing spot, so I will try and be brief. Went to the basement bar for Friday happy hour, and it was love at first sight. Cozy, dark, and welcoming- this is a place you can get lost in.Grabbed a seat at the bar, and were warmly greeted. Ordered margaritas and some small plates, they were both outstanding. Tried numerous small plates, and each one was delicious and hit the spot.If you like margaritas, you will be a happy camper. Also try the stuffed mushrooms, they are amazing.After leaving my new favorite place, we went to the Taste of Scottsdale, and it was surprising that none of the food there was HALF as good as what Rokerij provided. After a few samples, my group gave up, as it wasn't fair to our stomachs to put average food with amazing Rokerij food. All in all, not a bad problem to have.The bf and I wanted Dick's Hideaway for breakfast, and were not particular about which location we ate off the menu from. For some reason. we just didn't feel like being cramped in the location next to Luci's today.Very glad we tried the Rokerij! It was not busy for breakfast, so we got a giant comfy booth to ourselves. It was nice and dark inside which we like! The service was fine. We had Ryno today, and he was outgoing, spoke about a few menu items, and generally came back in a reasonable amount of time. I decided to try something different, and got the dungeness crab omelet featured on the blackboard. It was a generous amount of crab, peppers and onions, paired with the standard tortilla, potatoes and beans.  Not something I'd order on a regular basis, but this whole place is a bit of an adventure and the crab omelet really hit the spot.He got the meatloaf and eggs, mmm spicy!! You have to ask for ketchup for your potatoes, and we were only brought one ramekin, but that's okay. It sufficed.We don't really care for free valet as we are fully capable of parking our own car, but at least when we walked out, they brought our car immediately.Overall, not enough for the 5th star, but it's worth the drive for something different. We are dying to come back for lunch sometime and try that Pasta Heidi or Chimayo Chicken! I could find the back door and restrooms here, too. The ladies' room was clean with interesting artwork on the wall. This is silly, but I loved that they had the nice soft paper towels. Maybe that's why the menu prices are so high lol.4 1/2 stars actually...I really enjoyed Rokerij. Our server David was fantastic, and even though we were seated at the bar for dinner, the level of attentiveness was super. Knowing that we had never eaten at Rokerij, David took the time to explain the menu in detail and made recommendations.Rokerij has quite the wine and beer list, however I opted for one of the specialty cocktails listed on the board. It was a double berry martini. I guess I was thinking double berry meant double the berries but it actually meant double vodka (I am a rookie, what can I say?)and was far too strong for a girl who likes her alcohol embedded in a concoction that tastes yummy. David must have seen I was struggling to drink this so he very kindly got a tall glass with ice and added some lemonade and then poured my "vodka surprise" on in. Yay! It was much more suitable and I was able to enjoy. :)I ordered a sirloin steak with roasted corn and their signature potato baked into a green chile. The potato was cold but it tasted good and definitely had a kick. My friend ordered the enchiladas (one steak, one chicken, one shrimp) and loved their dish.I would definitely go back and try out some of their other dishes, There was so much that looked and sounded good. Sitting at the bar, we could see the food being prepared and everything that came out looked delicious. The portions are very generous at Rokerij. We will be back soon!JD invades AZ Day 1:Rokerij (pronounced Ro-k-ray and is the Dutch Word for Smokehouse (which raises a whole slew of questions that I won't get into) is listed as one of "Arizona's 50 Best Restaurants" by one of the local food bloggers (Ricky Lee Potts). It also came highly recommended by my Dad, and knowing how picky he is, I knew I had to check this place out. Appetizers/Small Plates:Bacon-Wrapped Scallops- I saw this as one of the review highlights and knew I had to have it. The BWS were huge, cooked perfectly and they are served with four amazing sauces that are the Chef's choice for the night. On this night they were 2 kinds of Green Salsa, Red Salsa and a Hollandaise sauce. My clear favorites were the Hollandaise and the Red Salsa but they were all good. 5*Pan-Seared Salmon- Small bite-sized pieces of Salmon with a Chipotle-Mayo. The Salmon itself could've used some seasoning but the Chipotle-Mayo was excellent. 4*Santa Fe Trail:Carne Adovada- Smoked Pork shoulder that's simmered in a Red Chile sauce and served with Rice and Beans. The Rice and Beans were pretty standard, but the Pork itself was excellent. It literally seemed to get better and better as the meal went on but it also got progressively hotter and hotter as the meal went on; I was sweating like Britney Spears on Jeopardy by the time I was done eating. 4.5*Chile Potato- Apparently this is one of the dishes that Rokerij is famous for. It's a fire-roasted green Hatch Chile that's stuffed with a mashed potato mixture. I'm not sure if I had it on an off-night, or what, but it just didn't do it for me. I mean everything was there for a stupendous dish but there just wasn't any flavor. I had my sis and Bro-in-law try some just to verify it wasn't me and they agreed it was a fail. 2*Beverages- Rokerij has a really impressive wine selection -which I'm not really into- and a mediocre beer selection; I was not impressed with their draft selection. They also have an über-cool underground (literally and figuratively!) bar that is separate from the restaurant itself; I can imagine the shenanigans that ensue there! 4*Service & Ambiance- Our waitress was very friendly and extremely knowledgeable about the menu because my sister always has questions (Oy gevalt...) and she answered them all quickly and to her satisfaction. Rokerij is very dark; has a nice wood and brick interior; and even has a fireplace going at all times--which is kinda odd seeing that it's in Arizona. The ambiance is definitely set for a date night kinda mood: very romantic and sexy--not the place you wanna bring a precocious 3-year-old (Whoops!). 4.75*Value- Pretty good value for a really nice place like this. I'd say the avg entrée runs anywhere from $15-30; which is pretty good for high quality food. 4*If you're looking for a great restaurant to impress a special someone; a place to celebrate a special event; or even something as casual as a date night then this is the place for you. I wouldn't recommend bringing kids with you as it's just not a kid friendly place and that's ok, too. You don't have to take the little monsters everywhere.This a one of my boss's favorite places to take special guest. Located in the same parking lot right next to the new Richardson's. There is a really cool patio that connects the two restaurants with an outdoor Bar. Instantly puts you in the party zone and makes you feel right at home.This is the first time my wife and I have been to the Rokerij and it was truly a fun and happy experience. Been to Dick's Hideaway and the older Richardsons many times in the past. The selection on the menu here has several of the same tasty good SW options with some really nice EuroAmerican surprises.Love the way you can instantly smell the aroma of the Pecan wood coming from the sizzling grill. Pecan gives the food some very nice flavor and that extra kick. Everything here and his other restaurants always taste great and leave you satisfied.Upstairs and downstairs are both the Rokerij now. Upstairs is quite a bit larger with a nice bar and a larger seating area. Downstairs has a top secret elevator or you can take the stairs. It is smaller and offers food and drinks as well. Could even be a nifty bomb shelter in a parallel universe.We started off with some Prime Rib Sliders and Bacon Wrapped Shrimp. My boss and his lovely wife ordered the New Mexican Platter and the Salt and Pepper Encrusted Prime Rib. My wife order the awesome Chimayo Chicken and yours truly went with the tasty Grilled Swordfish Special. Chocolate Flan with a 1/2 shot of Grand Marnier completed the trifecta.Really love the way they layer the flavors. The atmosphere of this place and friendly servers are also a delight. We arrived early and were able to get a large table by their cozy rustic fireplace.Place gets really busy quick. Try and go before the crowd and you will enjoy everything that much more. When we were leaving it was starting to get crazy. DRINKS ON ME EVERYONE!5 STARSWhen pressed for that *one* place to visit in Phoenix, there is only Rokerij. Somehow - magically - the space is designed to feel intimate. Cozy. But the space meanders around. (The booths have room to seat parties of four to six, depending on the side of the fireplace you're gazing at.)Dates would be impressed. As would a business partner or your girlfriends. The hushed tones of the dark room encourage whispered conversation. The food and wine has always been impeccably delivered. The Oysters - just stop. Whatever you're doing can wait. Go. I promise you, your palate will enjoy the menu. I have a few photos up of sliders, scallops wrapped in bacon and artichoke dip. But that is an injustice. Rokerij offers a robust menu.Happy hour is quite generous. If you're not sure pay attention: Happy hour is *every day* until 6pm. (Reverse HH is 10pm to midnight.) Alas, the true secrets of happy hour are best revealed by calling in. They change often and may not make it to Facebook or their website in time. Visit often and you'll know the inside scoop!Currently... Wonderful, hearty glasses of wine are poured for 1/2 the normal price. All appetizers are $2-3 off a plate. But you *must* sit at the bar.The bartenders are well versed in their product knowledge. The table staff are stunning. Visiting here is like visiting dear, close friends. Special note: The space is ADA accessible. Parking is valet. Thanks Rokerij!Finally decided to check this out recently. Great atmosphere, great food, and great drinks. I'm not sure what can be said that is not found in other reviews, but Rokerij is very good. It's a grill, so vegetarians might not find it too their liking, but others will enjoy their evening. If you're looking for a nice place to eat or drink, check it out.

Restaurant name  Cafe Sam
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
This was my second time at Cafe Sam and both times I dined here because it was arranged through my job.  The first time I dined here, I was looking forward to it, because everyone whom I've ever heard talk about this place raved about it, yet I left wondering if everyone who has raved about it just has really bad taste in restaurants and their definition of "good" food.So, on my second visit I inwardly cringed as my 2 companions raved about the place and teased the waitress about the list of specials which is absolutely ridiculous however it does seem as though the restaurant has pared down their enormous menu and specials menu from the only other time that I was there (I remember it taking our waitress at least 5 minutes to ramble off the specials on the previous visit while on this particular visit it seemed to take half the time.  I ordered the linguine with shrimp scampi which I asked to add spinach but was told that it already had spinach (the menu is so large that it would be impossible for them to list the ingredients in each dish) - so while someone may think, "oh, it's great that they have a large menu," the truth of the matter is that they don't seem to be able to therefore do anything well - it's all rather extremely mediocre at best to nearly inedible.  My companions enjoyed their meals however, and they ordered the linguine with salmon and the smoked hot dog special covered in some sort of  BBQ type of sauce.  My pasta was bland - I never add salt when I go out to eat and I had to add salt but even adding salt and some pepper really did nothing to give the dish flavor.  I left the restaurant dissatisfied and hungry for a good plate of pasta, which I rarely eat by the way, and it actually had me thinking about how much better the Olive Garden's pasta is compared to Cafe Sam.  I'm just completely baffled about the popularity of this restaurant though as some others who have given the restaurant the fair 1-3 star reviews have already mentioned, this is a haven for senior citizens and from the other Yelp reviews for out of town guests who maybe don't know what good food really is.  With all of the other options available nearby in Shadyside and in Bloomfield this is the last place that I would go next to the other Baum Blvd. debacle, Ritter's Diner.  I don't know why or how folks flock to either restaurant nor how they rave about either establishment other than to say that both places must hold some nostalgic value that makes people overlook the bad food.

Restaurant name  Yusef's Middle Eastern Restaurant Grocery & Deli
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
Yusef's is my old standby place when I crave middle eastern food, Lebanese style.  The Gyros are excellent, right down to the pickle and the sweet onion... mmmmm.  The portions are generous, and everything is always well prepared.  They serve a hummus dis that I really like... it has beef and pine nuts.  The baklavah is good.  They usually have several different varieties.The place has always been run by really nice people, but the new owners are the nicest people yet.About a month ago, I was on the way home from visiting my cousin in the hospital when my growling stomach let me know that no food for 12 hours was not making it happy....  I ran into the store at 6:45 pm.  They close at 7.The owners were at the front counter.... "You're hungry," said the woman looking at me with concern"yes," I nodded  "Can I get a Gyro, or is it too late."She looked at her husband... "she's hungry," she said to him... He hesitated."She's hungry!" the wife repeated...I knew they had probably cleaned up already and were getting a sandwich even though it was inconvenient.  I was so grateful.  It was the best Gyro I have EVER had...  I stop there about once a week now, on my way home from the hospital.  I get a few groceries and something for dinner. I always get there by 6:15 though.My friend was in the Service and had a craving for some Middle Eastern food so I pulled up Yelp and this seemed to be the closest in my area. I have driven by this place a gajillion times in the last 13 yrs or so and thanks to Yelper's I have learned that not everything is what it seems looks wise. It was 6:30 this Saturday we barely made it in time. It was clean I was happy to sit down inside and get out of the cold.The server was pretty polite. The food took a little while but it was worth it. I had the Veggie Platter they were out of something they substituted with rice bit it was all good. Great humus and falafel yummmm I want more now lol I love love grape leaves and cant get enough now I know where to go to get my fix! The lentil soup was awesome and served steaming hot in this weather totally hit the spot with fresh pita bread. This was plenty of food perfect for sharing and I'm not even sure I'd ever order that plate for $12.99 on my own. My friend had the lamb kabob and some soup as well and no complaints here either. They have hookah's and the good shisha my friend grabbed us some mint flavor which he love's I'm pretty sure its not any cheaper here than say a smoke shop. I saw a sign that said they have whole lambs and they had tons of stuff like gallon Tahini tubs and cute little tea sets among all the food stuff that looked good too. All in all I will be back to try some more delicous eats!falafel phoenix best falafel best phoenix best falafel phoenix best phoenix falafel phoenix falafel best phoenix best falafel6 Star Falafel !    IT'S GREEN!Seriously the best in the valley, perhaps anywhere.  AND IT'S GREEN!It really does look like some hippies may have cooked up a batch of "Magic Falafel" in the back of their VW camper bus in the Shakedown Street parking lot of a Dead concert.  I'm sure it's more benign spices making these garbanzo flour patties the color of money, grass, and a soccer player's ass, but they are a mos def a HOMEMADE recipe.  I'm not saying all light brown falafel is from a box, but that's what most gyro places are doing.       8^ P`.',.`    ---pPbblltptllptbtI can do box all by myself.Various kebobs, dolmas, greek and tabouli salads, pita sandwiches -- the menu is classic greek fast food deli style, which just like the strip mall pad they occupy, the menu is a bit smaller than it used to be. They've changed ownership and also pared down the size of their store significantly since their heyday.  Yusef's was Best of Phoenix by New Times, or AZ Republic, or Get Out, etc, quite a bit circa 90, 92, 93, 95, 96, 2001 if I remember the signage.  Since then, things have gotten tough in the American economy for a niche market of Middle Eastern folks.  I sure hope they didn't suffer from former customers purposefully avoiding them after 2001 for any sort of discriminatory reasons -- what a shame that would be!Perusing the aisles of the grocery while waiting for your food to be prepared is like being flashed to an indoor version of an exotic marketplace bazaar (like in the first Indiana Jones movie, or hey, like Shakedown Street) full of strange and enticing shapes and smells and textures, foreign languages, and lots of "What the heck is THIS!?".  Spice grinders!  Pomegranate juice! Curry powder! Turkish coffee pots!  Anchovie fillets! Fresh Olives! Tamarind extract!I'm ready for the PARTY!  Where's the Houkka?  THERE IT IS! Up on the wall, several to choose from actually.My green falafel sandwich was freshly made, hot, and delicious.Still the best falafel in the Phoenix area (but sadly, it was found to be "Magic" only in it's tasty savory goodness).   Only $5.99 with a soda, or check with the owner on bartering your knit sweater-making skills.Can anyone recommend a good Goo Ball vendor for dessert?

omg amazing place! definately try a green-sauce enchilada with cheese, the rice and beans are amazing and salsa reminds me of the authentic places in San Diego...tiny hole in the wall though, so keep an eye out for it...if you exit the 1-10 at 32nd, head south about two blocks, make a left (east) on broadway, its right after 36th street in an industrial area....if you see Napa Auto parts across the way, you found it! :-) they will literally make you ANYTHING you want (within reasonable terms of course!) and they have a good kids menu for the little ones

Review Text :
Bado's is a quintessential Pittsburgh pizza stop. I may even consider it the best pizza in Pittsburgh! I hadn't been in since 2008 or so which was pre-food allergies for me. My friends got pizza and said it was the best they had had in a long, long time. I really don't think you can go wrong with any of the toppings.If you've read some of my other reviews, you know I have 14 food allergies. This makes it almost impossible to dine anywhere, but when a restaurant feeds me with ease, I am a happy camper! They accommodated me with no problem and I had a delicious grilled chicken salad! I was very impressed.My mom was not too keen on her bruschetta wedge salad, mainly because of the dressing (which is homemade, however I do love their homemade greek dressing!). She still managed to devour most of it, though!The staff could have been a little friendlier, but they made a meal happen for me, so no complaints!

When I get excited, I squeal like the little child that I am. Another childlike quality I posses is the overwhelming love and affection for pizza, so you can only imagine the complete and utter detestation that I felt when I learned I had food allergies to gluten, eggs, and dairy. My poor little baby heart just broke. That is, until I learned that Pizza Heaven, appropriately named, was placed on this planet, in this very city, right down the road from my home, just for people like me. Gluten Free Dough. Vegan Cheese. Abundant Toppings. Yeah - I squealed. I ate the shit out of that pizza. I even loved it on day two. And day three. And if Pizza Heaven doesn't watch out, I'm going to be back again every night for the next week. The place is uber cute. The staff is friendly. The location is great. The parking is accommodating. They have "regular" food (pizza, subs, pasta, etc). And they serve booze. Thank you for catering to us pain-in-the-ass children that were put on the planet to make everyone's life difficult!My last review was hard to swallow, it wasn't something that I particularly liked doing. Having said that, I am proud to say I can't possibly give Pizza Heaven anything less then 5 stars now. This is why:Two days after posting my last review, I was contacted through Yelp by the owner. She had even found my phone number and email address and contacted me there as well, after I didn't respond promptly she tried me again......it was evident she wanted to make things right and talk about my experience at Pizza Heaven. Over the next two weeks we discussed the issue and she apologized more then once and explained what had happened. We talked a bit about the compromises and challenges to running your own business and I found out all about where she sourced her Vegan cheese from, how to order other items Vegan at the restaurant, and about a new vegan sausage she was trying. Suffice to say that the owner cares immensely about her business and her customers. If all owners cared this much we might have a real dining dilemma (does Yelp exist in a society if every place warrants 5 stars??).I am happy to say that the owner made things right to my satisfaction (and then some) and I am also eager to let veg heads know about the new Vegan sausage - its pretty damn good. I have gotten two pies since my last review (sausage and green pepper) and they have been much better.I am glad that Pizza Heaven is now back on my pizza rotation. I am even more thrilled that we have owners like we have at Pizza Heaven here in Phoenix.I have been to this place many times now over the years. Surprised it has taken me so long to review it. Maybe, I thought I had.Anyway. Great location. It used to be more south. It was a cool little hole in the wall back then. Now it is more like a cool little family restaurant. They play live music even on certain days.THe food is good, the atmosphere is not too bad.It is a nice place to go and not too bad on the wallet.On a busy day or night parking can be tight. But,  other wise it is great. Check it out one day when you are on the East side of pghoenix. You just might like it.Even the name fails to covey what lies inside.Pizza Heaven is the type of place you could drive by and never even notice however, that would be a mistake because Pizza Heaven Bistro  is a great place to grab Italian food at a reasonable  price.I have been to Pizza Heaven a few times and have never been disappointed. The menu includes a wide variety of pizzas along with a tasty selection of pasta entrée's.Pizza Heaven Bistro is fairly small however, they have a robust take out business as well as a very busy dine in traffic.  The food and the service are always good. The atmosphere  feels a bit like home. What more could you asked for.  Good food,  good service,  great prices.

I had a great lunch here!The service, TBH, was average, but they pre-bused the hell out of my table so I was incredibly delighted!(Lack of pre-bus is a HUUUUUGE pet peeve of mine!)There were several items on the menu that I really wanted to try and I was truly torn on what to get.There was a Wild Boar dish, a Salmon that sounded amazing, and a Duck dish that sounded awesome, too!I'll walk you through the meal...1.)  They bring you some delicious breads (a Rosemary and Sea Salt bread, and another plainer Italian bread) to dip into a plate that had 2 perfectly rounded scoops of spreads in a pool of olive oil.The scoops?  I think that one was an avocado-based spread and the other, I think, was a black bean spread--neither of them were overly flavorful, but both were relatively light and fresh.**My Faves Here:  Sea Salt & Rosemary Bread with the [Black Bean] Spread2.)  Next was salad: You can choose a Caesar salad or a pickier/plane salad (but the plane salad will take extra time to make because the servers prep the salads themselves--so it was explained to us, anyhow).The Caesar was good!  The anchovies are diced into the dressing, but you can barely recognize them if you're not a fan of anchovies and are worried about that.I honestly wouldn't have even known they were in there, had I not asked!**My Faves Here: Go for the Ceasar; it was great!3.)  For an appetizer (this is a weird choice, but I'm happy we did it), we got the "Chef's Vegetarian Sampler".  This included a delicious, and lightly spicy, Barley Risotto, some Sauteed Spinach, and some type of [fried] Potato dish.  It was very good!**My Faves Here:  The Potatoes were pretty addicting!**Least Faves Here:  The sauteed spinach--very garlicy!4.)  I ended up choosing "Lidia's Pasta Tasting Trio"--and I would recommend that to others who find themselves torn between several things.Here's how this works...There are 3 pastas "of the day".The servers bring around large bowls of all three types of pasta and places all three types on your plate for you to try.One you've sampled all three, its "all you can eat" of your faves.They'll ask you what types you'd like more of and give you more.Not a bad deal!The day that I went, all three were pretty good.One had a spicy, red sauce and wide noodles.Another had an olive oil based sauce and had Orecchiette pasta.The last one was the one that I could have eaten allllllll day!It was simple, but amazing!Goat Cheese filled Ravioli with a Butter and Thyme sauce!  Ugh... to die for!Let me tell you about this ravioli!They were not "doughey" at all; they were perfect!Very thin pasta, but none were broken!Delicate and perfectly filled with the most amazing cheese.The butter/thyme sauce wasn't the least bit overwhelming!It was the perfect compliment to this dish!...just thinking about it makes me want to go back to Lidia's NOW!**My Faves Here:  OBVIOUSLY the Goat Cheese Ravioli!**My Least Fave:  The Orcchiette dish.  It wasn't "bad", it was just "meh".5.)  Oh, yes... there WAS dessert, too!  ;)(don't judge me!  lots of folks have dessert at lunch-time!)  ;)I enjoyed the Tiramisu!Now, some people like it when the lady fingers in Tiramisu are very Rummy tasting, but I am not a fan of too much of that!This was perfect and delicious!I would def recommend it!All in all... Lidia's = WIN!PROS:  Delicious;Pre-bus galore!CONS:Parking (but you can park in the "dust bowl" across the street.Located in the stripPretty busy on the weekends!It's been a while since I've written about Lidia. Well, Lidia's, not Lidia the person. After a couple hit and miss visits with the various pasta trio tastings I had, I'd say I was back in Lidia's good graces with their massive brunch spread.I will give you ample warning, DO NOT EAT A SINGLE THING BEFORE YOU COME HERE FOR BRUNCH. For realsies. It's a crap ton of food! And the best part? It's a bargain! For $28 you get the brunch buffet, your choice of main course AND a mimosa or Bloody Mary. Isn't that a bloody good time? Why, yes, yes it is. You just have to roll me out afterwards!The buffet is awesome, with tons of traditional anti pasta's, meat trays, soups and salads. I actually went two weeks in a row (I know... that's a lot!) and got to see that they actually change out the buffet items quite a bit. The first week I went I had a delicious bean salad and artichoke salad. The second week I came they had fried risotto balls, which I promptly had about a million of... and tasty mussels. For your main course there's about 12 different options to choose from, including the pasta trio of the day! The first week I went with the Salmon over beans and potatoes. I asked for it rare, and rare it came out! It was very flavorful and I liked the charred pieces. I could have used a few more veggies underneath, but the salmon was so large (about 8oz I swear) that it just took over the entire plate! The second week I had stuffed cabbage and mash potatoes. Odd for a polish meal to be on the menu, but it was delicious. I'd have to say even better than the salmon. I loved stuffed cabbage and the mash potatoes were certainly home made and not instant (could you imagine the horror if they were instant?). With all that food it's hard to believe I had room for dessert. But how could you NOT indulge when it's also on the buffet just staring at you waiting for it's chance to be eaten! The first week I took the traditional tiramisu, which was fantastic! I like tiramisu that's not too espresso tasting and this was perfection. Very light and tasty. The second week they had a lemon tiramisu and it was a little slice of lemon heaven. Even better than the regular. I shoved so much in my mouth I thought I was going to throw up. But it would have been all worth it, I swear!So heed my warning, friends! You will thank me as you're rolling yourself outta there!

Review Text :
So a couple of months ago my co-worker and I were on a dangerous mission to find the one great burger in town. After months of search and going into some of the seediest joints in town, we arrived at Welcome Diner, I was a bit skeptical that this place could produce a burger  that my co-worker and I were so desperately seeking, but oh how rad being wrong is, they knocked the shit out of my taste buds with there burger, I got a double with cheese with a fried egg on top (old school son), I literally finished the burger before my co-worker got his (which was like 5 seconds later) , a true delight. If you go bring cash money thats all they take, also its a small joint so don't go brining like 40 of your office buddies you'll look like a tool.I have been here 3 times. 2 times to eat and once I forgot cash. The first time was not great the fryer was down and the fry's sucked. The 2nd time was a little better. Except the food inspector was there. Normally this is a non-issue but in a diner car that serves 9 you hear and see everything. We ordered 2 doubles and 1 fry and a bottle of coke. One burger was made incorrectly as they added grilled onions to both. I was feeling generous and did not ask for a new one. (I should have though, I do not care for onions on the burger) The fry's were good, in fact I could have eaten another order. The cook Andy and the waitress were so frazzled by the inspector they kept forgetting things like opening the bottle of coke, ketchup, other peoples meals, the "regular" got a double when he ordered 2 singles and made sure Andy knew it was 2 singles...The other "regular" looked as if she rolled out of bed, smoked a J, slapped her over sized headphones and Ipod in her PJ pocket and rode her bike here. She totally dumped her bike in the front, like she owned the place. Andy asked several times for her to move it but pot head didn't get it. Andy asked the other regular to do something for him discreetly since the city guy was there, not sure what but he was outside for a while.  I like Welcome but with 2 issues in 2 visits I dunno If I will be back.The enthusiastic Chef Payton Curry has taken over the Welcome Diner for now, offering his unique culinary creations to the public on a limited time basis. The self proclaimed "guerrilla gourmet" has an emphasis on using local, fresh ingredients, which he obtains at local farmers markets and direct from local farmers. He cooks up all types of cuisine, but he also caters to the vegetarian/vegan eating crowd.My wife and I visited this past Tuesday and were treated to a scrumptious 6 course vegan meal tasting that we thoroughly enjoyed. If you're looking for some local, delicious, gourmet food whipped up by a chef who truly enjoys his craft (and makes it show in his food), a visit to Chef Payton Curry is a MUST!Full review with photos at: http://wesnovack.com/gourmet-vegan-dining-with-paytoncurrys-local-vegetable-dishes/HOURS (from paytoncurry.com )We will open on every first Friday of each month and every SUNday, MONday, and TUESday 5pm-CLYou will also be able to book the inside 8 seats on Wednesday-Saturday and have Payton mess with your palette while he doesn't hold his tongue. Contact for more info..BEST BURGER SPOT I'VE COME ACROSS!! I was out one night craving a burger and jumped on yelp and happened to be driving down roosevelt. This was the first place that came up. I drove down and stopped by. This place is really cool. I like the open setup outside. There's benches for you and your friends to chill on while u enjoy your meal.  There's a dinner car that seats about nine people that's cool to sit in. The service is GREAT!!! All the people there are super cool. A very friendly atmosphere that anyone can enjoy. When your foods ready they always check to make sure everything's right before giving it to you. Now.... The burgers and catfish sandwiches are AMAZING!!! I have had the welcome burger, the peanut butter burger and the Friday night catfish poor boy!!! All left smiles on my face wanting more. You have to try this place out!!! IT'S A DEFINITE MUST!!!First off, the food is incredible. The menu is very simple and to the point. Don't let that fool you. I got the sausage corn dogs. YUMMY. A must try. Also the fried green tomato sandwich. The bread they use is quality and so tasty. I gave it 4 stars because I feel like the staff could be friendlier. And eventually, I'd love a bigger beer selection. Try. This. Place.Part of the charm of this place is that it is in a poor residential neighborhood in downtown Phoenix, not far from 7th St.  Also, you could easily drive by and not even notice it exists.  So charming and the loveliest of dives you will ever visit (or shizzhoels as I call them).Now, about the food and experience.  When you walk inside there is only about 8 or so counter seats in what looks like a converted studio home/living room.  The feeling when you walk in however, is that someone beamed you into the 1950's.  Authentic and totally retro.Now, the best for last... the food is not your typical diner food.  Much more creative and original than any diner I have ever been to.  And being from NY I KNOW diners!  Practically grew up in them.  This diner, while having a VERY limited menu (when compared to any NY diner), each and every dish is incredible.  Try the Big Jim!  It will wow you... Fried Chicken breast  with cheddar, bacon, homemade biscuit buns and gravy.  Wowah!  (Oh, and definitely not the dish or the place to be if you wanna eat healthy!  More the once in a blue moon calorie splurge place... at least for me.)Oh and order off the menu the "Cannibal Fries".  Simply off the chain.  Fresh cut potato fries with caramelized onions, cheddar and homemade russian dressing.  (Deep Breath!)I told my hubby we absolutely had to stop by welcome diner during our trek to Phoenix. From downtown we took a short lightrail ride (because he doesn't like to walk recreationally) then ironically still had to walk for what appeared to be forever through the sketchy part of town -- no we didn't take the art district route.The diner literally is a mobile kitchen. Bigger than a food truck, I mean enough to situate a counter, a line of barstools and the cooking area. The guys on board are super friendly, accommodating and truly love the contribution they've made to the community.Yes this little kitchen serves cocktails and beer.We ordered the acclaimed big Jim, two of them, hash browns and beignets. Our big Jims were delicious. Extremely hearty with extra gravy. Unfortunately, however, without the gravy, the biscuit would be just thirst inducingly dry. I suppose that would be one way to get you to drink more!  Again loved the gravy. They even gave me a ramikin of their mushroom gravy cause they felt I had to try it..also quite delicious. The hash browns and beignets were alright but didn't contribute to this diner's stars.We were impressed with our main entrees and by the guys who run this little miracle on wheels.

Review Text :
Ah, Fiesta Cafe.You do not deserve all five stars on food alone, but there are so many additional factors.First off, Fiesta Cafe is a flagrantly ridiculous adobe structure, looking as if it was transplanted straight from the American Southwest into the midst of First Street in Champaign.  Ridiculous.  Awesome.  Hilarious.Next, the service is fast, friendly, and the food delicious.  I ordered the chilequiles, which I'm a bit particular about.  I also wanted them with scrambled eggs, which seemed odd and self-indulgent, but they did it PERFECTLY.  And I was delighted.  The food was great, and i was pleasantly surprised as I thought it'd suck or be midwesternly bland.Finally, as I left the patio, full and happy, i stopped and looked about.  There are a plethora of flags, American, Mexican, Peace, LGBT Rainbow, a whole plethora of flagtasticness.  'Twas nice to see a cool, friendly environment.So, in conclusion: Ridiculous pueblo, frighteningly good chilequiles, flagtasticness, wondrous service.  I was delighted.

Okay so I have to make a confession... Del Taco has some of the tastiest Chocolate Fudge Cake around. In addition to the nummy little thing being just the right amount for under $1.50, you can get it at 3:00 a.m. when there is no hope of finding such a treat elsewhere.You will never catch me having a crispy shrimp taco (the idea of seafood from a fast food place makes me want to hack), but holy bajeebus... that cake is like crack!

Review Text :
I went somewhere tonight that I wish was George & Dragon, which made me realize that I had never written a review for one of my favorite standby restaurants.  So I wanted to give my 100th review to a place so deserving of recognition.I've been to G&D dozens of times in the past 8 years, and I can honestly say that I've never had a bad meal or bad service.  As a vegetarian, my favorite meal was always the Cornish Pasty. Mmm. Just thinking about it makes my mouth salivate.  A beautifully flaky pastry filled with potatoes and vegetables.  And peas, I love peas.  So yummy, I can't really remember many other meals there, although I do remember having a very good roast beef recently.The booths are awesome. The owner is incredibly British, and it shows.  There is a ton of authentic paraphernalia decorating these walls.  Plenty of British ales as well.  It's the standard to which I compare all British pubs in the valley.So many reviews so I'll keep it short. I really enjoyed this place I would soooo go here often if I lived closer, like probably daily. Guiness, good food selection and Spotted Dick!! K?? K!!I've always wanted to try this place after I heard their weird radio commercials a few years back.  It always cracked me up whenever the guy talked about the bangers and mash.  We finally stopped by one day after a lovely little trip on the lightrail.The entrance is a little confusing being on the south side of the building.  I guess this is because I am used to entrances being in the fronts of buildings as opposed to on the side.  When you walk in, you see everything you expect.  A couple pool tables, dingy floors, a seedy looking bar, and tables and chairs scattered about.  There are a decent amount of booths as well.  One thing that I noticed and considered a bit odd was the fact that a third of the restaurant seemed to be sort of partitioned off for the "fancy" dining area.  I don't know if that is the case, but it definitely looked that way.  When it comes down to it, this place is a classically tacky pub type restaurant, and I like it.Unfortunately, the food is not so great.  Neither is the bitchy service you get when you come in.  A half smile would be a welcome gesture instead of a perfect view of my server skulking in the kitchen.  I'm not sure what was up with that.  Maybe PMS.  The husband ordered the bangers and mash and I got the cornish pastie.  The husband mentioned that he had to add a lot of salt to his gravy, but he seemed to enjoy his meal.  Me on the other hand, not so much.  My gigantic pile of peas that kept rolling of my plate were cold and had a few hairs in them.  They definitely weren't mine, I checked.  The pastie was delicious, and I really liked it, but the accompanying mashed potatoes were too thick and lumpy to be any good.This place just isn't good enough.  Hair in food is just plain gross.  Mediocre food combined with rude service is not going to get me to come back.  Besides, I am sick and tired of hearing the owner of this place bitch and moan about the lightrail being a detriment to his business.  I don't know how you can say that when the place is packed on a Sunday afternoon with no sporting events going on.Riding the light rail daily to work has changed how I go about my commute home. It was by the grace of a good friend that I stopped off for a happy hour special at a Midtown drinkery. That's all it took to get me hooked on the idea of stopping off for a drink after a hard day's work. And the proximity of George & Dragon to the light rail launched what is my current obsession.With good intentions, I stopped at G&D yesterday for an Irish Car Bomb and a Guinness, and to get some food to take home and watch a movie. At 5:15 there was hardly anybody there, but I suppose most people are commuting at that time. I overheard another patron ask about their "Slay The Dragon" program. Participants, it so happens, are given a card with all of the restaurant's beer listed. The steady drinker consumes one of each (there are 66 different beers!!) within a month and is awarded with an "I Slayed the Dragon" t-shirt. What a sweet concept! ***The steak and kidney pie was also a nice treat, with that certain crispness of the kidney strong but not overpowering. In the past, I've also gotten the fish and chips (FanTasTic!), bangers and mash (excellent) and the wings (very good).*** I think it would be swell if we organized a daily UYE to help each other through this beer challenge. Even if it's only done during happy hour (4-7) after work,  that's only 3-4 beers a day.G&D was our first stop for our Pub Crawl, the fried food sampler was good and the drinks were decent pour and priced. The server was nice and everything went well. The location is lose to a rail station with just a short walk.all hail the brits, summer hours and day drinking benders with my brother. oi, oi, oi!my brother joey calls me up one day: "hey, can you drive me downtown tomorrow?"me: "why?"joey: "i have school down there in the afternoon, but i was invited to go bar hopping after class tomorrow night with some friends. i don't want leave my car out there overnight if i'm going to be drinking."me: "well, my company lets us have summer hours on fridays, so i'm done with work at noon. when's your class?"joey: "not til 6pm... but we can go earlier and grab beers or lunch first at this british pub near my school."me: "done. pick you up at 1:30pm." click.now this was in early august, so it was blazing hot that day. i pull into the george & dragon parking lot a bit dismayed there was no covered parking. oh sweaty joy.the good news is, it's nice and cool inside and strangely crowded for a work day.  we find seats right up at the bar. i notice the girls working there all have this suicide girl thing going on and the one guy we see working there (who appeared to be the manager?) has this MASSIVE pompadour thing going on with his hair. it was larger than life... like that thing you try not to stare at, but can't help it. in my peripheral vision, i could see my brother look over at me. i knew exactly what he was thinking and i smirk. then mr. pompadour-manager guy comes right over to us and asks if we would like menus. my brother smiles and nods a yes at him, fighting back laughter. while we're pouring over the menu's we order some pints. i decided that i fancied a kiltlifter while my brother orders the fuller esb. i try a sip of his, and crikey it's good. they're extra cold too and go down smooth. i end up ordering the fish & chips with the cole slaw and my brother opts for the sheperd's pie. my brother, never one for being a wimpy little nancy boy decides to order a shot of whiskey with this next round. i get the boddingtons this time, he gets the harp. me: "um, don't you have class? won't you be knackered by the time 6pm rolls around if you do a shot of whiskey?"joey: "nah, i'll be fine. we just have a quick test and then we can leave. i'll ace it."me: "well, cheers to that then."  *i raise my glass, clink*finally our food comes...... and i only have 2 words for the perfectly golden crispiness of the fish and chips i had for lunch: DAMN GOOD.we finished off our grub just as this cheeky lady and her husband sit down next to us. we chat them up over more pints (i have water, because i'm driving) until 6pm rolls around. i visit the bathroom upon our departure and am happy to report while initially it looks a bit dodgy, it's actually quite clean. we wave goodbye to mr pompadour-manager and we're off.i found out later my brother got an A on that test. HA. figures.good show george & dragon, all hail the queen! cheerio.From the other descriptions I am reading, I believe our party had the same blond bartender.  Granted she didn't curse out anyone in our party, but it wasn't a very pleasant experience.  It's like she can't be bothered and perform her job in pleasant manner.  Why employ anyone like that?  Last time I checked, restaurants were in the SERVICE industry, so provide better service or customers won't come back.Good place.When I want to get my English on, this is the first place I think of!!! The owner of this pub is the funniest, sweetest bar owner I have ever met! Each time my girlfriends and I go here he is always greeting us and sits down and chats! My favorite night is trivia nights on Thursday evenings. It's always fun to test you and your friend's random knowledge. The best part is, everyone in the bar participates and everyone gets into it. Not only can you enjoy great food, delicious beers and fun people, the winners of trivia get free food and drinks! How does this not sound like a great place to visit?! Just an FYI this place gets crazy around soccer, I mean football season!!! Fun place to check out!UK pub atmosphere in PhoenixI have never been to a pub in the UK.  Howerver, I have a image in my mind of what a pub in the UK might look like and George and Dragon made that image a reality.George and Dragon is unpolished, and unpretentious.  The atmosphere is very relaxing and welcoming.  As I  sat muling over the menu I enjoyed listening to the random music being played.  In the short time I was at George and Dragon I  listened to  metal, George Michael, Aretha Franklin, classical and everything in between. The customer service at George and Dragon in amazing.  The servers  were very accommodating without being intrusive. Our server took the time to explain the menu and even offered suggestions based on our preferences.Moving onto the food.  The food at George and Dragon is great and served piping hot (which I truly enjoy).  The unique combinations of flavors were prepared and presented perfectly.  My lunch party and I tried Bangers & Mash, Roasted Vegetable Pastie, fish& chip, Shepherd Pie, and Meatloaf. All of the entrées were delicious. Even though we were full from lunch because at George and Dragon the servings are large. We had to try dessert. So we ordered blackberry crumble and  bread pudding.  I have to say the bread pudding  was the best I have ever had.We will definitely be making this place a regular stop.I used to like this place as my hang out on Friday nights. I used to be friends with the bar staff and owners.  I am Indian from India with a nice beard. Some one offered me drinks and skipped on their tab and the bar wanted me to pay for the other persons tab even after my tab was already taken car of. I refused because it was not my drinks. I offered to pay for my share. But the owners brother, who I thought I was friends with showed his true colors and  told me I was not welcome at the bar anymore. George and Dragon used to be my favorite go to spot to hang out for drinks, but after the type of insult and racism I experienced, I do not think that it is a place I should go to anymore. Maybe all us ethic people should visit this british pub to make it feel authentic like it is in England with a lot of ethnic people.This is probably my favorite neighborhood bar, and mostly because it's just a hop skip and a jump from my front door - or a scoot on my bad*ss kick scooter. (like a razor scooter, but more awesome)Lock that puppy up (again, bad*ss scooter reference here) on their bike rack, hop in with your pals for a late night clandestine meeting of the minds - at least that's what it'll seem like after a few of those $3.75 well drinks on a Friday at 9 or 10 pm, when in reality, it was just two or more buffoons boozing around making fools of themselves.I'd say that I'm more a fan of neighborhood type bars than dance clubs, mostly because they tend to be lighter on the wallet than the latter. Call it a dive if you must, but I wouldn't classify George like that. Sure there's the obligatory pool tables and darts that make up a good dive. On any given evening, you might run into someone toting along their children for the 'grille' part of this bar and grille, but really, it's certainly more bar than grille by hefty proportions. I can't recall how many nights have ended at George, but you can rest assured that there will definitely be more.Happy Yelping Phoenix, come meet George, he's kind of awesome.

OK people. Let's face it. If it was called Cleveland Market, nobody would go. But throw in a trendy city's name and "Oh, it must be fantastic." After all Boston does have the Celtics. And they gave us Kristin and Jared. But can they pull off fast food. Yea, kinda sorta. It's nice to have a fast food option that is a "square meal." No burgers or fries. Roasted chicken, that holiday green bean casserole everyone loves but is too afraid to admit they eat it, mashed taters (gravy sucks ass though)...all pretty descent. We even tried the sirloin there, cooked medium rare, but WOW, it was like $12! So, I'm sure it's not even a Boston based company. And we all know it's nothing like a market. But three stars for dependable, un-bunned food! Oh. The cornbread? Seriously, it's "crack" good. I'd knock over school children just to get an extra one. As they say in Boston, "cheers." I know. Lame. Now, go get some cornbread!

The only good thing about Applebee's is that it gives bad parents somewhere to take their bratty kids while still having a "night out" so they don't infiltrate places that I actually want to go. One star for that.Two stars only if you stay in the bar and stick with beer and appetizers.Well folks, I did the chain thing. I confess. Rickie and I had spent and exhausting day (and a quick $200) at Target and were thinking steaks. The budget didn't include Morton's or Ruth's Chris. I had brain freeze and forgot the local spots I love so much that grill a mean meat (i.e. Phoenix City Grill), so the first restaurant past Target that fit the bill was our local Applebee's on Camelback and Central. Mind you, I don't expect a decor marvel or a hostess so hip it hurts. I know what i'm getting myself into. For the most part. But I had recently seen a TV commercial from Applebee's and of course the food was airbrushed so perfectly like Celine Dion's face on the current issue of HELLO magazine. I mean, really, Celine, you have no wrinkles even after living in Las Vegas these past couple of years? Anyhoo, we were greeted and seeted promptly by a teenager who definitley just had a smoke and could use a visit to the tanning booth. Once seated, our server, Mo, took our drink and appetizer order and quickly disappeared. For quite awhile. Cue the Jeoporady theme music. Once our iced teas and the new appetizer (tuscan cheese bread extravangza) arrived we sipped and dipped. Not bad.Raspberry tea with an univited yet delighted visit by vanilla and the cheese spread was rich and yummy served with a spot of diced tomato, basi and garlic...aka bruscetta. NICE. We ordered onion chips, like an onion loaf or the blooming onion at Outback....they were good. Two sauces for our dipping pleasure...one your typical ranch, the other a sort of spiced up thousand island with horseradish. Then the entrees arrived. Cue the creepy dum, dum, dum, music...Both NY strip steaks over cooked to such an extreme. The asparagus was limp like, well, let's just say it reminded me of a Vietmanese gymnast I once dated who didn't take the little blue pill. Sides included mashed potatoes (loaded) which means bacon, cheese and sour cream. Ok, Ok, Ok, too much of the extras. What ladle in the kitchen did they pick to put these extras on my mashed potatoes? All in all, I had low expectations at this venue, and they were met. Shout out to Mo the server, a good gal! The clientele was like a scene out of Dawn of the Dead. Sorry. Lesson learned...Applebee's ok some of the time. Get an app and a drink. Skip the entrees. Be nice to a nice server. And for God's sake don't expect a steak worthy of the big chain peeps.I will give this Applebees location a 5 star and here's why. I used to work here and know the cooks and staff. I have inside information on how this location does things in relationship to other locations I had filled in at. This location has better cooks and better management than some of the other locations. It shows in the food. Very seldom do I eat at this location and get a bad meal. Best nights to go Friday or Saturday after 4pm. The best cooks are working then, these guys have been at this location for over 8 years and they know what they are doing.

If I were to stop and get a donut here..I am not saying I have, just if I did ..I have to say they remind me of the ones I love from So Cal.  They would I am guessing, have that light greasiness combined with sweetness. Probably they are lightly iced .I bet if I went there I would really like an old fashioned one. Just if I went there.I'm out of the closet!Yay!No more hiding who I really am!I'm a proud member of the Rainbow Donuts coalition.It's not a choice...not just a lifestyle selection (although the donut selection is, in fact, quite robust)...no, it's how I am constructed!OK, actually I'm bi...I enjoy the occasional "breakfast burrito", but if I'm pressed to choose...I'll take the hole and the "Old Fashioned Glazed" that surrounds said hole.That and a good cuppa.And that's one of the things that separates Rainbow from the rest...the coffee...outstanding Italian roast, well made and very inexpensive...with enough refills to take a bath in.And I would bathe in the coffee (and possibly the donut glaze) except for the inevitable "dust-up" that always occurs when I let my impulses run wild and free!Don't get me wrong...the donuts are terrific and the nice young lady behind the counter was almost as sweet as the apple fritters.I had a client meeting there this morning (I know, I spare no expense!), and my clients were just as charmed as I was with Rainbow...the great coffee, the terrific donuts and fritters and the pleasant service (not to mention free wi-fi for my meeting) all combine to make Rainbow Donuts a significant step above the rest.Most of all, it's the place where I can feel free to be my real, authentic self...out, loud and proud!And growing a little with each fritter.

Review Text :
I went to this airport foodery with thoughts of getting a great Oaxacan meal at Sky Harbor Airport. But that was a fantasy. Not sure why I ever thought that, maybe it was just the Oaxaca name.This is burritos to go. I ordered a Machuca Oaxaca burrito, Machuca being shredded beef mixed with onions and chilis. The Burrito was surprisingly small. I agree with Eli's first review. It was not that tasty, and it was real watery or wet. I went through 10 napkins, because everytime I squeezed the burrito by taking a bit, a puddle appeared below the burrito. It got to be irritating, as I didn't want greasy stains on my clothes, so I was trying real hard to wrap up this burrito so it wouldn't leak from the bottom. It still leaked. After every bite. A little puddle I would wipe up with yet another napkin. The chili sauce was spicy, and was perhaps the best thing about the food. Machuca Burrito and drink totalled $8.53.I hate to admit it, but It made me crave for Chipotle!I still love this place and I got dinner to take home for us here last night.It was hot and fresh, and oh so good!Their portions seem a bit smaller than they used to be. But, I am noticing that every where now. They still sell everything at a really good prices. They make the tortillas fresh here and everything is nice and hot when you get it.Their salsa is divine. So good.I of course got my favorite, Chicken Delight with Verde Sauce. Loved it! There staff is really nice always, very happy and friendly. You have to love that. When most people in the Airport are a bit on the Grumpy side.

Restaurant name  Miracle Mile Delicatessen

Review Text :
Dear Miracle Mile,This is the last time you will ever sucker another $15 bucks from me for bland, over-salted cafeteria food. I hate to be the rabid cur of dissent in this love fest, but I can no longer fake it and go with the flow. I despise everything about you, Miracle Mile.Unless someone had cued me into the fact, I never would have guessed that you were trying so hard to duplicate NY deli-style fare. Why so? Because every NY staple I've tried from your fetid excuse for a deli has sucked so effing hard it just about pulls grey matter out through my ears. Stale and mealy defrosted cheesecake that was as unappetizing to look at as to consume. Matzo ball soup so bland I had to keep looking down to assure myself I was indeed consuming something other than hot air. Wilted salads guaranteed to deflate my hopes upon first bite. Vegetable soup that was so flavorless as to be nearly nonexistent. Are you trying that hard to fade into the background, you wallflower? It's no wonder the median age of a patron in your restaurant is pushing 80. The near total annihilation of my taste buds is the only way I would ever step foot through your doors again.And then there's your pathetic excuse for a sandwich, Mile. Pastrami and corned beef sandwiches piled (not so) high with bland, fatty meat that's been slopped with reckless abandon atop your choice of bread, guaranteed to disintegrate in five seconds flat. All topped off with a slice of sweaty Swiss cheese that adds zero flavor and flops listlessly atop a piteous excuse for a sandwich. If it weren't for the spicy mustard at each table, I'd hardly have tasted anything at all! Bravo! You surely deserve an award for the most poorly constructed sandwich in all of Phoenix! Although I guess that dubious honor should clearly be bestowed upon your brusque, monosyllabic cafeteria line workers. "Next? Bread?" Unappetizing slop of meat, slid down the line to the next guy. "Fries?" Heap of fried garbage, liberally applied, slid down the line. That is, unless you're asking for something outside of the crap-sandwich-and-fries box. At that point your request will be wordlessly acquiesced to with a scowl and a slop. "Drink?" No! Please! NO! Just get me out of this slovenly pit of cafeteria hell. What do you want, I'll pay anything! Anything!Wait a tic. That's your whole ploy all along, isn't it Miracle Mile? Brainwash the masses with mediocre food and overcharge for everything to make it seem like it's a privilege to be dining upon such slop.Well I'm on to you. I've given you plenty of chances, Mile. Your Reuben was the only sandwich that didn't make me want to violently upend tacky cafeteria tables on the way to my car. Wishing you the bland, inoffensive dreams of an automaton,EricaSo, I love deli food.  a lot.  I've tried a few deli's out here, including these guys, and I have to say, I think I like them!Prices here are typical deli, but from what I can tell, cheaper then others.  You can get just about anything, anyway you want.  I love how they have Matzoh Ball soup, big huge deli sandwiches, and all the fixings.  YUM!The past few times I've eaten here, its been on lunch with coworkers.  I've kept it light with my order, since falling into a food coma and taking a nap at my desk after a huge lunch is generally frowned upon by management.I've gone with the Kosher beef hot dog, fries, pickle, and tiny pop for a grand total of $5.24.  My friend usually gets the tuna on wheat while here, and she likes it here as much as I do!What I do find odd, is that its buffet style serving.  You walk through the line, give your order, and walk down with your plate while the guys behind the glass fix your order.  Service here is quick and efficient, and seating is plentiful, even during the lunch rush.I would recommend this place to most anyone, and they have multiple valley locations.  yummy!

Noon and I'm starving! hadn't eaten since the night before... i could feel my stomach slowly eating itself! after picking up some stuff on my way back to work i saw Blimpies... as usual... seen it a million times but never stopped in. there were a few folks inside... looked cozy enough.. the lady behind the counter wasn't very social... just what do you want.. and that was it... :( i had a toasted 6in with roast beef/ turkey/ cheddar... They didn't have very many veggies to choose from..... not even pickles... for some reason the sandwich was really small and was not filling at all... i was still hungry... It left me wishing i had chosen subway instead... and just for that dinky sub i spent $4.75... Not worth it in my book...

Review Text :
My boyfriend summed up our experience at Coup Des Tartes pretty well, even with the spelling and grammar issues - I swear he's college educated; he just thinks it's 'kool' to 'right' in his own unique style :)I'm just going to add my own two cents...After reading so many great reviews of this place, we were both pretty excited to try it out.  I made our reservations online with no problem.  As he said, going on a Wednesday night was perfect - it was not too crowded and we received great service. Claire and Mona took great care of us... great ambiance and food too - To start, I went with the Roquefort Salad (their signature salad) and it was delicious! Jared was happy with his mussels appetizer as well.  They brought plenty of bread and butter for him to sop up the sauce as well - it too was fresh, moist, and yummy. Jared had the chicken entree and I had the lobster... I really enjoyed it - the lobster itself was flavorful and it also had a light sweet sauce (with coconut) that enhanced each bite.  I liked that it came with asparagus as well as a risotto.  I didn't love that the risotto had pineapple in it, but that may be just me.  We didn't need it but J twisted my arm to share a dessert... chocolate crusted cheesecake with an orange sauce and fresh berries - the perfect sweet ending to a wonderful meal!If you like quaint, unique, local places, check out Coup Des Tartes - you won't be disappointed!Loved it!!!We went there last Friday night to be romantic and it definitely did the trick. I had never experienced a BYOB restaurant before and after experiencing it first hand I am hooked. We started the evening with the fillet Mignon tacos and they were fabulous, the perfect start. I had the chicken breast. It was stuffed with goodness and was served with squash, corn, and garlic mashed potatoes. A drizzle of pesto lined the outside of the dish and was the perfect accompaniment. My husband has the salmon as was very impressed (I don't do fish so I can't go into more detail). For dessert we had the four berry tarte, it was warm and the perfect end to a fabulous meal. They serve the type of food that continues to come up in conversation throughout the evening, in a good way.Coup Des Tartes was really a 3.5 experience for me, but I'm going to round up.My husband and I chose Coup Des Tartes for our anniversary dinner this year for a few reasons - 1. BYOB.  2. We love French food and always go to a French restaurant for our anniversary and 3. Its billed as being romantic.  Those seem like pretty reasonable requirements, right? First of all, this is not French food.  Sure, there are French inspirations and they serve brie but the menu is largely American with all sorts of influences.  (My husband's entrée had cous cous!)  Second of all, I didn't find it romantic.  I guess if you use romantic to mean the same things an East Coaster means when they say "intimate" or "cozy"....which to everyone else means cramped.  I wouldn't have minded the close quarters had it not been so loud!  The loud ambiance and the bright lights killed most of the romantic atmosphere. The food was solidly good.  There was no "close my eyes and savor" moment.  My husband enjoyed his lamb, even if it was definitely not a French preparation.  I ordered the lobster, as I've heard Australian lobster is the best of the Pacific lobsters.  It was good but I'll take a Maine lobster any day.  Naturally, we had a tarte for dessert. I have to say was the most dissapointing part.  I was expecting one large circular tarte and what was placed in front of me was a pie slice of a tarte.   I think that Coup Des Tartes would work best for a small group....I think 6 may be too big.  It does work for a date, just don't expect it to be too romantic.  The prices aren't outrageous so it would make a nice night out with a significant other or friends.  I think for a special occasion you can do better.Updating my review after a horrible experience trying to utilize their private room, Rendevous, for a birthday dinner.  Their event coordinator dropped the ball with several huge miscommunications during the 4 weeks we were in touch, and then went MIA for a week and a half before the event.  In the 11th hour, three days before the event and ON my actual birthday, I had to pull the event when there was no way to find a mutually-agreed upon solution that would preserve the original intent of the evening.  I had to inform my 27 guests of the last-minute location change via e-mail after sending formal invitations weeks in advance. The entire experience was a nightmare and having the owner yelling at me on my birthday was not the highlight of my week.  The most unprofessional and offensive experience I have ever had within the service industry.Coup des Tarte delivers exactly what its name suggests, a ravishing blow to the palette that storms your mouth by force and takes no prisoners.  The chocolate and caramel fleur de sel tart is a testament to the aphrodisiac quality of fine food, and it had me moaning at the table heedless of surrounding company, who conveniently were also moaning with pleasure after sampling the four berry tart with vanilla gelato, so at least I was in good company. The small converted house lends a homey, romantic feel with wood floors, soft curtained windows for natural light and warm walls that were decorated with a discerning eye for color.  The tables are small and a bit crowded, but are not close enough that you will end up distracted by surrounding conversation.  It is most assuredly not a place to bring a large group of people, with a count of four being about the max for a comfortably seated party.One thing I adore is that it's BYOB, which is a blessing because their menu is pricey enough as it is without tacking on the inevitable, exorbitant price of alcohol.  Instead they charge a nine dollar corking fee and provide all the necessary accoutrement for opening and chilling your selection during the meal. The appetizers are consistently delicious.  The three onion tart in particular is the perfect balance of sweet and smoky, with the tart crust and caramelized onions playing up the sweet side, and the smoky bacon with Gruyere cheese satisfying the savory.  It is an honest to goodness coup des tarte in your mouth, as has already been discussed.  The chevre cheese and tomato appetizer and country pate plate were also rich and savory, the walnut bread with the pate being particularly notable, although they lacked the complexity of the three onion tart and seemed much more savory. The entrees were perhaps the weakest portion of the meal, which was surprising considering they're naturally the most expensive.  The duck breast was cooked to perfection and wasn't too fatty, and the honey, lavender, rhubarb sauce was a beautiful compliment to the meat.  The accompanying green beans and mashed potatoes fell far short of the duck though, and could have used a more creative interpretation.  The Moroccan lamb shank with Israeli couscous and chickpeas, however, was off the charts delicious!  It was fall of the bone tender and all the components of the meal were highly complimentary.  The sea bass I've had on previous visits also suffered the same fate as the duck, with an ultimately well prepared and scrumptious protein accompanied by lack luster sides. But ultimately it is the dessert course that is the crowing jewel of this establishment. Don't say, "Well I never order dessert." Or "But I'm watching my weight."  Believe me, you want these perfectly prepared, sweet and salty concoctions to make love to your mouth.  Every tart I have ever tasted has elicited the same sleepy smiles of contentment and pleasurable moans.  In fact, it might even be a better investment to go a nontraditional route and just skip right from the appetizers to the dessert course.  That way you can order several varieties and indulge in blissful, sugary enjoyment.I'm updating my review based on an other incredible meal at Coup Des Tartes on this past Thursday night.  I went with a party of nine. Most of our group ordered off of the Yelp Eats menu, but I mixed it up a bit and ordered off the regular menu instead (hence my review here instead of under the "Yelp Eats" listing).I started with the Roquefort Salad (the house specialty) - it was just as amazing as I remembered.  My fiance was literally "foodgasming" over the onion tarte appetizer (and I admit, my bite of that was pretty amazing) but the perfectly dressed salad filled with organic greens, roasted apples, toasted hazelnuts, dried figs & Premier Cru Roquefort had me pretty much there myself!The entrees at the table were pretty amazing too... I tasted the lamb (yum!) and the fettucine (delicious) - but I ordered the baby scallop appetizer with a side of spinach as my entree and I was extremely happy with my selection.  I actually kept my mouth shut during the dessert course, but from the looks of the various tarte selections at the table and how quickly they disappeared, it's safe to say that none were too shabby.  There were no complaints at our table.We love that Coup Des Tartes is BYOB - just a $9 corkage.  Our friends brought a Riesling from Germany, we added a Turley to the mix, and enjoyed a bottle Bordeaux as well.Rhiannon, our waitress, took great care of our party, and we cannot wait to return again and again!Just left here not fifteen minutes ago.One table of ladies with one rude woman sat next to us. Not the restaurants fault, yet irritating that such people exist.Lemonade to drink, just fine as is.Brie Brulee 12Quite uninspired in presentation and the brie was very ordinary, my friends Mer and Mike serve one of much higher quality.French Dip Sandwich 12This one was with salad. Another lackluster presentation, but that would have been ok if were good. It was not, or at least to me. The beef was cut too thick and with it being too well done and the gristle made for a tough sandwich with little redeeming flavour.It was left half eatenChicken Cordon Blue 10I did not eat this, but Brice told me it was ok if all you were expecting is a chicken and ham sandwich. He did finish.We had mentioned we wanted to talk with someone about renting the extra room, or get a card. The wait person said ok after we are done she will send someone out.We did sit a while after we were done; no one came out or was a card offered. But it might have been because I guess I caught her off guard earlier.  In the middle of eating our sandwiches she asked if everything tasted good. I said no, she looked at me as if she did not understand, so I repeated that I did not like my food. Talk about someone's face changing from a smile to a deer caught in the headlights, she stammered and said sorry then ran off. NO question of why I felt displeasure or any thought of remedy. It did give us a chuckle with such lack of attention. But what it also did was make us reconsider if we should even think about the room for a party.So once again I am in the minority since no rave from me.Oh yeah and we had to ask for forks. Hahhahhahhah oh well.......If you're on Twitter you'll see so many different places you can follow. Its cool to because they announce deals and such that are coming soon. For instance, Coup des Tartes tweeted that they would be running the Yelp Eats menu this past Friday and Saturday. I was super excited because the night I was supposed to go there was a family emergency and I had to cancel. Anyway, once we arrived we were given the standard menu so we asked about the Yelp Eats menu, "oh yeah sure". What was brought back was not the Yelp Eats menu but some 3 course prix fix menu for $25 that didn't even have one Yelp Eats item on it. No onion tart, no lamb shank etc.. VERY disappointing and irritating. Do not call a Ferrari a Corvette, no matter how you slice it, they aren't the same thing. Anyway.. ended up ordering the pate and onion tart appetizers. The pate is not house made and tasted like liverwurst, the onion tart was very good. However, once we learned that there was no wine service and a (correction, not $12) $9 corkage fee, that was the nail in the coffin, we were out the door. At the end of the day they falsely tweeted to get customers in the door then try to pass off something that isn't. Very misleading, the classic bait and switch apparently still works.My parents were in town a few weeks ago, and when my parents are in town, we like to take them to restaurants that they've never been to before.  My dad appreciates good food, and we had a feeling he'd like Coup Des Tartes, so that's where we found ourselves on that particular Saturday night.We brought the wine (a bottle of red and a bottle of white) and my parents picked up the tab... such a deal!  We were seated in the back room - one I'd never even seen before... there was just our table and three other tables in the little room.  I convinced my mom to share the signature salad with me to start... and although Jared asked my dad to share the onion tart as an appetizer, my dad insisted on ordering his own.  (It worked out though, so I was able to take a few bites of the tart too).  For our meals, my mom and Jared went with the chicken, I had the salmon, and my dad went for the steak.  My fish was cooked just perfectly and served with an amazing butternut squash risotto and some green beans too.  Everyone enjoyed their meals and despite the fact that we were all pretty full, we went ahead and ordered the mixed berry tart with four forks for dessert.  We cleaned that plate too.Needless to say, we were right about my dad enjoying his meal at Coup Des Tartes.  We've always had great meals at Coup Des Tartes and we're sure to be back again real soon.There's just something missing at Coup Des Tartes. How do they say? "je ne sais quoi..."?The interior ambiance is perfect. Probably the highlight.On my most recent visit, I had the three onion tarte, which has a lovely sweet flavor and the salmon. The salmon was so ordinary. It was cooked well but something was missing from the preparation for me. However, I loved, loved, loved the savory butternut squash risotto. If only the salmon had been as "ah mah zing" (citing the menu) as the risotto was!I've had the chicken option before, too. It was just fine. But, nothing has blown me away. And, bringing your own wine to enjoy has the potential to really compliment the whole experience. Make it richer.  The fact that it'll cost you $9 minimum just to open it (a task you literally do yourself) is a sore spot for me. I think that corking fee is waaay too high! It's fun to go to coup Des Tartes because the ambiance and you know you'll order a tarte for dessert. It's like, that you'll enjoy dessert is guaranteed -- but, there's something -- that "je ne sais quoi..." that's still lacking...

Delirious from hunger and unable to think straight I let my daughter talk me into the worst decision I've made in quite sometime. We ordered a Tempura & California Roll Lunch Combo plus a tootsy maki and a tuna avocado roll rolled in toasted sesame seeds. The tempura arrived, everything was barely crisp, a tad greasy but otherwise somewhat edible. When we got our sushi rolls it was apparent with one look that they were total crap, however, starving as we were we decided to carry on and eat. Tootsy Maki= DooDoo Kaki! Don't be fooled by the long wait, they are not making these fresh to order. This was definitely a roll that was prepped and pre-rolled last night! The seaweed was chewy and slimy, the dried up rice almost broke my tooth and the crab mixture was like eating mayo that sat out over night. My Tuna and Avocado roll which I asked specifically to be rolled in TOASTED SESAME SEEDS, was no better with it's also chewy seaweed and RAW Sesame Seeds, I didn't order a damn big mac. WTF! The California roll that arrived lastly with the salad was the same kind of pre-rolled crap. We ended up leaving it. Unfortunately I had to pay for this shit, but made sure to thank the sushi guys for the worst sushi I've ever eaten and let them know that I knew they  had served us pre-rolled crap, and of course they had nothing to say but "have a nice day"! *vomits*I should explain I don't like sushi.  I have tried to like sushi.  I dated a guy many years ago who was really into sushi and he would take me to the best Omaha has to offer and show me how to use the chopsticks and mix the wasabi, the whole 9 yards.  I gave it the good ol' college try, and I just can't do it.  My stomach rolls over after a couple of pieces.  Well, I think that, combined with the fact that when he purchased his new 7 Series, I didn't writhe all over it like Tawny Kitaen,  made me less appealing.  Such is life.  Now I'm married to a man who doesn't like sushi either.  What was I saying?Oh yeah!  We had a great lunch at RA between movies.  We each had the shrimp tempura bento box, which came with 4 shrimps, a spring roll, a potsticker, a salad, miso soup, and some fluffy white rice for $8.95.  Everything was delicious.  We also tried their seaweed salad which was nice and fresh.  The service  was great too.We  had a few of their cocktails which if memory serves, were very tasty, but we got a little loaded and then went to see Gravity in 3D, so my memory is a little hazy.   It was one of THOSE afternoons.  I thought the lunch was definitely a great deal and would go back for that anytime.

I didn't make it very far without sneaking a bite, and in the future I'll know not to press my luck and just enjoy my food with the others parked out front.There are definitely no frills here, I walked in the doors to a long counter with a woman standing behind it, a series of reach-in coolers behind her filled with assorted jamaican drinks amoung other things I didn't catch, and a fairly open kitchen with a stove, a steam table, a warmer, and some equipment around the corner I couldn't see. As noted in another review it was (refreshingly) very clean. The menu is posted on the window as you walk in, along the wall on the inside, and also on a chalk board inside. I don't know if the chalkboard changes at all, but it seemed to have the same items on it as the printed menus.I was a little torn by the options: red snapper, oxtail, curry, a stew, goat, jerk chicken... but I went with the jerk chicken. And then comes the decision on the sides... mac n cheese, cabbage, more rice n beans, greens.. I went with cabbage. A small plate is a whole to go container of rice & beans, chicken, and cabbage - so I have no idea what kind of food you get in a large plate. The desserts sounded fantastic, I almost got a rum cake but stopped myself. (That was the one moment I was happy I couldn't sit down and eat, because I knew if I had more time to debate with myself the rum cake would have been purchased.) My small plate and a ting came to around $11. Not bad. After I ordered, the box was assembled as I stood there, everything either sitting hot on the stove or warm in the steam table. I was a little surprised as she flashed the filled container to me in approval before she shut it, but looking back it was nice touch to be able to check my order right there instead of getting to my car (or home) and being disappointed. I got to my car and noticed a few others eating, took a few bites myself, and then continued home. (windows down, windows up made it too tempting to nosh at every stop light)The jerk was really nice, very mild and sweet. I almost wished it had a little bit more heat to it, but very good. The cabbage was a little on the salty side but once you start mixing it in with the perfectly cooked rice and beans it all evens out. I definitely want to try a few other items on the menu, and if they are anywhere near the caliber of the jerk, I know I'll be very happy with them as well.

One year, by matter of coincidence, I was in Bobby D's for a drink after work on St. Patrick's day and I couldn't help but notice the steady stream of neighborhood folk coming in for take out corned beef and cabbage. This year, I enlisted a coworker to accompany me and bear witness to the fact that it was NOT a liquid lunch so I could see what the fuss was about! (It is a workday, after all!) For $7.95 you get a platter full of well-seasoned, fork-tender corned beef, at least a quarter of a boiled cabbage, cooked carrots and potatoes. A small plate featuring creamy horseradish, horseradish and spicy mustard was delivered with our meal. Corned beef sliders were another option ($5.95), although we took the traditional route. While the flavor on the corned beef was excellent (we detected a hint of cinnamon), the veggies lacked seasoning. Other fun facts about what you can find at Bobby D's: ~ Lots of neighborhood peeps sportin' their green on St. Patty's ~ TVs -- I got to watch a little of the NCAA tournament during lunch! ~ $1 vodka soaked gummy bears (an interesting novelty in which I did not indulge)

I love love love this store!!! I go there whenever I feel kind of homesick (I grew up in Latvia) or when I want to get some Russian marinaded but not too salty pickles, just like my grandma used to make!Great selection of all kind of Russian and European beers! I always have something special to bring when I go to an American party ;)lots of Russian candy, sausages, pelmeni etc.the only reason I give 4 stars, because it's hit and miss, sometimes they don't have some things, or black bread is not very fresh...but what can one expect, it's highly specialized grocery store, it's not like tons of Russians live here and go there every day.Overall I highly recommend it to anybody, if you are not brave enough to try Russian food, at least you can try Russian beer or some Moldovian or Georgian wine ;)But semi-salted pickles are the best! mmmmmm I'm drooling just thinking about them :-p~This is a rather sizable store as ethnic specialty stores go; don't be deceived by how it looks from the storefront. There is a good selection of sausages and other cured meats, cheeses, refrigerated food items, beverages, dessert items, candies, and other grocery items too varied to mention here - look at the pictures I posted for a sampling of what the store has to offer. While most items here are Russian, there is also a lot of foods and beverages from other European countries such as Poland and the Baltic states. You can also come here for lunch from Monday to Friday  to try borscht, dumplings (pelmeni and vareneki), blintzes, and different kinds of sandwiches. I find the prices to be quite good, too, for the quality of the food and other merchandise they offer.

I stopped by the Chicken Box to grab lunch today.  I hadn't been there for a long time, and I was really excited about getting some of their fried chicken, mac & cheese, and collard greens.  When I pulled into the parking lot I noticed a big sign hanging down from the roof proclaiming that the original owners were back and it was under new management.  I hate to say it, but the original owners have really messed up a good thing.  When I went inside the huge menu board that listed all the amazing soul food side dishes were gone.  I guess the new management is trying to just rip off Price's by having the only side dish be mediocre coleslaw and bad tater tots.  The real shame is that they obviously changed the fried chicken recipe.  Does anyone know where the old managers went?  I need more of there home cooking.  This new chicken box cafe is terrible.

I know a lot of my friends really like this place, but I just can't get over the bad service and the food really isn't that great. It's really close to my house, so I go a lot to hang out and listen to the music that they have come through. Seriously though, I have stopped eating there because I realized after the 4th time that I have had "digestive issues" EVERY time I eat there. No joke. When I did eat there, the food really wasn't that great. Usually a bite or two is good, then it just gets really gross. I've tried about every side item that they offer with there entree's and they are all pretty gross to me as well. The potato salad was the only thing that I actually thought was okay. And one time I went there and she listed off my choices for sides, I said "chips" her: "oh, we're actually out of chips" me: "soup" her: "we're out of that too now" me: "so really, what are my actual choices?" her: "salad". Sorry to all my friends who like it, but it's really not that great. I think people come in and are charmed by the homey, inner-city art dive feel it has.A Phoenix original if ever there was one!  Total gem in the lower Grand Avenue area.I love the unique atmosphere here.  Post-industrial meets shabby-chic meets post-modern meets trading post.  Or something like that.I wanted something different and ordered the Panini Cubano.  I thoroughly enjoyed the shaved prosciutto, black beans, melted swiss, pickles and chipotle mayo.  I also sampled the sandwiches of my wife and daughter and they were very tasty as well.  They had the pesto chicken and the lamb gyro, respectively.The Paisley Violin is now firmly  entrenched on my list of cool, reasonable and unique places to grab lunch and to take visitors from out of town.

I have to agree with Patti B. that this location pretty much sucks.  The service is just ok - they are far from friendly.  I've been in  a couple of times to pick up food and I have yet to be impressed.  I wanted to give them another chance tonight and I should not have bothered.  The food is not so good.  I'd rather go to Pita Jungle or Thai Llana any day!  The spring rolls are greasy and room temperature and the tofu is pretty nasty.  I had some kind of udon noodle dish and threw most of it in the garbage.  Use your 'free entree' coupon to save $$ one night, but that's about it... I will not be returning to (this) Pei Wei any time soon...I know, don't hate.....but I needed to find something inexpensive for dinner and asian sounded good.  My roomie said she liked this place so I thought I would give it a try.  I consider myself a connesour of good food. I love fancy restaurants with beautiful presentation.  But when you're short on funds you make do.  I have to say that I was not expecting much from Pei Wie.  Maybe that's not fair.  I walked in and was greeted warmly.  Since this was my first time the girl explained how to order.  I got the orange peel chicken and brown rice and an order of spring rolls.  I know this is not authentic asian food. But I will say this, it was hot and fresh and it was good.  The spring rolls were nice and crispy on the outside and cruncy on the inside.  The dipping sauce was good too.  My orange peel chicken had a little kick to it.  The veggies were cooked just right and the chicken was moist and tender.  And their ice tea was delish!  It went well with the meal.  Our server was attentive and brought us silverware and cleared everything when we were done.  The place was clean.  Even the area where the drink dispensers are was clean and sometimes that is an area that is just hard to keep clean.  I will go back to this Pei Wie and I will try others.  I think places like this can be hit or miss and that's why they get a bad rap.  But there is a niche for everything and this is one of those niche type places.  I liked it.  So sue me.  I also did not realize that Pei Wie is part of the P.F. Chang's francise.  I like P.F. Chang's too.  There I said it!  So, like Heather C. said......de-Elite me for eating at a place like this that's owed by a francise like that.

Review Text :
I call this... "Ode To The Only Resturant I Truely Love"My parents went to school with the owner's kids. They remember when it was a walk-up window take out place. Infact, when my father picked my mother and I up from the hospital after I was born, the FIRST stop they made on the way back to the rez was Poncho's! One of the co-owners likes to laugh and say that she saw me before most of my family did! I went from being in a car seat gurgling as my relatives chomped on the best chips in town served with some awesome hot sauce that hasn't really changed since I was young. To being a little girl who always ordered the deep friend tortilla wrapped hot dogs with crinkle cut french fries and the BEST coldest ketchup I ever had!! To being a young woman who brought every single close friend I met while being away at school or through the native pageant circuit to enjoy the wonders that is "The Works". My FAVORITE meal there is the cheese crisp as an appetizer, Combination #18 which is two tacos (i always order beef!), rice & beans. They have the best beans EVER!! And the rice is awesome too! I've had all the desserts on their menu and nothing really jumps out at me. I guess I still love the family tradition of going to the water & ice cream shop for thrifty ice cream before heading home! I have had many experiences at this resturant. I've held my high school graduation party there; this resturant was the place where I signed a contract that made me the goodwill ambassador of my people for nearly a year; it was from their bar that I had my first LEGAL margarita on my 21st birthday, it was also the place where my then boyfriend got on one knee and asked me to marry him, and it was their waitresses who said "to HELL with him!!" when we ended our engagement. It's a wonderful place to me, I like that I can go in and say "Hi Marty!" to their one time waitress who now manages the resturant. and have her yell, "HI CHERYL!!" Yes... that's right!! That's how long she has known me!! She can call me Cheryl and get away with it!! I also love the other long time co-owners/managers. There is one that always wants to buy a certain piece of jewelry off of me. And another who always laughes when I bring someone new in. Poncho's is a place of regulars... LONG time regulars. and i think this is what every great restuant needs. Local, long time regulars who grow with the restuant. Who bring in new friends to enjoy the huge wonderful chimichangas or the Presidential Special and laugh over delicious enchiladas while a secret service agent (who kinda looks like leslie nealson if u ask me) painted on the wall watches on. While a bustling resturant does what it does best: offer homestyled, friendly, affordable and great food to it's old time regulars and it's about-to-become regulars.Back in the day I used to drive all the way from Surprise to eat here, yes the food was that good. They used to have the most killer Pollo Fundido as well as amazing chunky salsa. Time has certainly changed this place.. we started with a cheese crisp with green chiles, delicious.. nice and crispy with just the right amount of chile strips.. also ordered their killer chunky salsa which was as good as I remember it. Then come my Pollo Fundido swimming, Im serious about this, swimming in a pool of grease!! They didn't even bother draining the thing before tossing it onto my plate. Was disgusting too, not even like clear oil but dark brown grease. Vile. Then the Misters Sampler showed up.. this thing was a fucking mess! You couldn't tell what was what under the piles of sauce and lettuce until you took a bite. Mini chimis were burnt, mini tacos burnt, tamales, cold and hard.. was a complete wreck. After a few bites we called it.. major loss of appetite.. a shame too cause the salsa was actually really good but the entrees were inedible. Meanwhile, the Mister was attached to the toilet within a few hours of eating here.. he was sick all day the next too.. so word of caution, eat here at your own risk.Im sure going to miss the good meals I used to have here, what a real shame.

Restaurant name  Macayo's Mexican Restaurants
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
Walking into Macayo's is like entering a buffet restaurant in a Vegas casino. Tacky, tacky, tacky. Loud wall paper. Lots of different rooms. And the people. Oh, the people! Men in Hawaiian shirts or local team jerseys. Women with big hair and lots of screaming kids. Staff is usually quick to greet and really quite friendly. Standard Mexican fare is widely available. Stick to the combo platters and you may leave happy. The carnitas entree is a sad clump of dry pork...gee, I think that's the same thing my Uncle Larry said of his third ex wife. Anyhoo, the chile con queso is quite yummy and actually not on the menu. You have to ask for it. Served with a variety of blue, yellow and red corn chips, the dippin is fun and filling. The guacamole is pretty good although it seems there's a little filler in there therefore the avocado flavor suffers a bit. I really like the mini chicken chimichangas. The minis, not the regular sized. The latter are a bit tough and big and hard enough to use as a door stopper. Macayo's is a family owned, famous Phoenix restaurant landmark. The Central Ave. location happens to be in my hood and sometimes the convience outweighs the dee-lish factor. My recommendation is two shots of chilled Patron before the food and everything seems better. Hola and adios!Oh...Macayos.  A once Phoenix staple has turned into complete and utter crap.  I spent many a high school evenings dining here after debate practices and I believe El Presidente Obama ate here within the past few years.  Things have taken a big turn for the worse.  I mean, you shouldn't expect much with their cheesy decor and a customer base similar to that of Wal-Mart, but it used to be decent - and edible.  Their menu got smaller.  Its hard to find anything under $11.  The food (even the side of veggies) was SOOO greasy and fatty. Seriously - I feel like I need to eat salads for the next 2 days to compensate for the calorie content of that dish. The baja sauce lost its kick.  The guac had no flavor. I regret eating here.DOUBLE-X BLACKLIST. Three years since my last visit (not long enough apparently), and it's time I updated and upgraded Macayo's to DOUBLE-X. See you in 2014 beeyotches.Where oh where have your owners gone, Macayo's? What happened to the quality of food with which you opened and on which your franchise and brand name are founded?FIRE your kitchen staff, FIRE your kitchen manager, and FIRE your general manager.Mediocre, bland, sometimes scary, late, cold, not clean, goopy, old and stale.--cardboard menu cards are wet and starting to mildew from days and days of moisture;--salsa 4 to 5 days old. the salt has made it briney, the green chilis are fermenting it into vinegar;--special "top shelf" fresh-fruit texas margarita is a swirl of gatorade-colored syrup and a complete waste of grand marnier; head to Quick Trip instead;--rice from weeks ago, reheated, refrigerated, reheated, refrigerated, microwaved and then served from oblivion; dry, cakey gloopy SHIT. Shame on you!;--refried beans go the same way. ranch style. they keep for weeks out on the ranch. didn't finish them? no problem. just throw in a bit of lard and put 'em back on the fire. Macayo's clearly has the technique mastered.--chicken "guisado" so old, even cooks from Diamonds wouldn't serve it;--flour tortillas either not fully cooked, or kept in the same damp room as the menu cards -- they were doughy and starting to ferment;--sopapillas for shame! looked like fried cowpies. you couldn't force feed me this shit! SEND IT BACK!!!After dining at the mother restaurant, you can be sure I'll think twice when I see the Macayo bird on something at the grocery. BLECH.This is the Very first Macayo's. Always good food! We love the chips and salsa, especially with a good cup of coffee!The food is always good, we are not much of drinkers but, we hear the drinks are strong and good.You can order almost anything you want. Even if it is not on the menu. Their BaJA Sause is fantastic! Lots of really good choices. If you are craving Mexican this is the place.Since zero stars is not an option 1 shall do. One of the worst dinning experiences EVER!Me and my party of 4 sat down on a beautiful Saturday afternoon after the PRIDE festival just down the road. We sat and enjoyed the free chips and salsa and nothing else. After 25 minutes and ZERO service of a beverage or even an acknowledgement of our being there we decided to leave. If the place had been busy that would have been different but we were 1 of maybe 5 tables being used. Sad sad restaurant. Never again.

Nice Little FindFound this location based on fellow "yelpers" recommendation for egg drop soup and the yelpers were right, of course,  this egg drop soup could be the best in town. China Village has great lunch prices.   Seating is always  prompt, service quick and the staff is very personable.The food is good,the portions are big and the service is awesome. Food is always hot and ready fast.  If you go a couple times,they remember you.Really good place for a quick bite.

Review Text :
This place serves the best BBQ within 5miles of the place I currently spend most of my billing hours.  Certainly better than the BBQ Company on 36th.I get the 2 meat combo which comes with a side (beans), chips (good chips), and 2 meats of your choice for like $7.50-$8.  I've tried and been impressed with the Pulled Pork, Brisket, and Smoked Ham.  Their meats have a very nice flvor and are served with just a tiny drizzle of bbq sauce, nothing more.  The flavor of the meats speak for themselves, you really don't need bbq sauce, but the drizzle is a nice compliment as opposed to being the main dish as it is at other, gross, bbq places.Service is quick, efficient, and very friendly.  They have a lot of micro-brew-ish sodas, fresh homemade deserts, and other yummy treats, if that's your thing.

One of my favorite places in town for breakfast. It's quick (once you're seated).It's greasy (like breakfast from a skillet should be).It's no-nonsense (hash, taters, eggs).It's served with a smile (and usually some awesome conversation).Is it super local? Super sustainable?No.It's a diner. But a delicious one.And there are planes!"B-B-B-Bennie!" Sorry, couldn't resist. But really this place is great and deserves the shoutin'.Where else can you enjoy a yummy breakfast while watching planes land and take off?? Nowhere. Nowhere if not for Pat O Malley's. Nope.Anyways, as we were sipping on our coffees and enjoying the glorious views, we ordered:*Tenderloin steak and eggs with hashbrowns *Co-pilot - three egg omelet w. diced ham, american cheese & cheesy hashbrowns *Flight Attendant - three egg omelet w. fresh spinach, sauteed mushrooms, swiss cheese*The Yoke and Rudder - 2 sunny up eggs and baconAll the meals hit the spot. Delish. But Pat's also has tasty English muffins and BISCUITS!!!! (my current obsession)"B-B-B-Biscuits!" Yesssss

Review Text :
I am one of  those people who loathe buffets and cheap Chinese "fast food". However, many of my friends and co-workers seem to love those types of joints, so I have reluctantly tried a lot of those little Chinese places tucked away in various shopping centers around town.  I want to find the exception to the rule and find one that I like, but I am always disappointed & never suprised. So, when I want to have good Chinese, I go to Wan Fu. I would have to say that it is most certainly my favorite Chinese restaurant in Charlotte. It has been here for about 22 years, and I think they have maintained the same consistency and quality from day 1.  Yes, it may be a little pricier than the typical little hole in the wall, but the portion size is big and the quality is excellent.And for recent transplants to Charlotte,  it may not be as good as the "super-authentic-ethnic places" that you can find in big cities with real Chinatown districts, but for this area, I think it offers the best quality and variety.   In any case, I can always find something here to make me happy.I love the traditional decor of the building - inside and out.  When you walk in it is a little dark, but I like the ambiance.  I have been here with small groups here as well as with large groups, and the service is equally good either way. They try to be very attentive,  making sure your order has been taken and that your glass is always filled and I appreciate their efforts. But I think the key to why I really like this place so much is that every time I have eaten here, my food tastes as if they have used quality, fresh ingredients and that the food was cooked just right. (Chicken is light & sauteed to perfection - not overcooked and rubbery, and the veggies are not overcooked either.)  Over the many years that I have been going to Wan Fu,  I have never had a bad meal here. I am not a fan of fried rice in general, but once I had their pineapple fried rice with chicken - and it was pretty amazing.  It is nothing like that pathetic excuse for fried rice that you get served at cheaper Chinese places!  I love all of the typical stir fry dishes here - the Cashew Chicken,  Kung Pao Chicken, General Tao Chicken, Firecracker Shrimp, etc.  Of course, I normally go with brown rice and you can choose a chicken & shrimp spring roll or a veggie spring roll.I have been many times for take out too - with their easy drive up window, its a no-brainer!After many years of going to Wan Fu, I think the quality is still just as good as on my first visit.  Today I did not eat in but called to place a takeout order at lunch time. My order was ready within 15 minutes.The lunch menu is a great value..  I got Kung Pao chicken ($8.25) with brown rice. They will sub the brown rice instead of white rice at no additional charge. Also, the lunch entrée comes with a veggie spring roll. However if you ask for spring roll with shrimp & chicken, they don't up charge for that either.They use fresh veggies and good cuts of chicken unlike most places in those strip shopping centers. Also, I never have that icky feeling I get when I eat at a place that uses too much MSG in their food.Wan Fu, keep doing what you're doing and you will remain my favorite Chinese restaurant in Charlotte!

Review Text :
Since The Veggie House turned into Loving Hut, I have been twice, and am very delighted at some of the positive changes that have occurred.The space itself is much lighter, and I feel more welcome by the staff. I also like that their food selection is WAY less greasy and has more of a focus on health.I have tried the spicy cha cha twice (it is actually yam protein breaded to look like shrimp) and it is FANTASTIC. I have also had the raw salad, sweet and sour pork, fried rice, one of the noodle soups, and the stuffed tomatoes. All were good, but the stuffed tomatoes could have used a little more flavor. Great portion sizes.They do not serve alcohol, but have some really fun concoctions to drink. Try the "Pink Lady" or the delightful "Sunny Forest."I went into this place weirdly expecting Pauly Shore to pop out exclaiming, "Welcome tuu the LUuving HuUt"  Please God no. When this was Supreme Master I knew I was in for a long wait and this is still the case, a party had to get their own menus they grew too impatient. Don't expect to be out of here in 45 minutes or under an hour for that matter.Vegetarian meals shouldn't be this hard to find and they are not, this is just another option to consider if you are on this side of town. I have found some items on the menu I can cross off, and some I will always make my regular rotation. Service is friendly but be sure to snatch your desserts before you hit the table, otherwise they will be gone by the time you finish your meal. Cheesecake is very popular and is frequently sold out. Just thought you should know that, before the vultures swarm.The Heaven Rice Rolls $4.00 are okay if you are a fan of the rice paper wrapping, although I did not like the cold, rubbery, not too flavorful texture. The peanut sauce was a compliment to every dish however, and could go on anything (it is supposed to come with a hoisin sauce). The Moo Shu Vegetables $6.95 came differently than how they are supposed to on the menu, it came wrapped tightly again with a rice paper instead of in a wheat Moo Shu skin. Not acceptable.The Sweet and Sour Divine $8.50 (rice separately white $1.00, brown $1.25) was delicious, a true vegan "junk food" delight. Soy protein, pineapple, carrots, and homemade S&S sauce which I thought they gave me a little too much of but that's okay. It looked like real chicken, tasted like real chicken, and although I have been a vegetarian for 8 years, it was reminiscent of the real thing and recreated that memory for me of eating some S&S Chicken. My mom who is not in anyway shape or form a vegan, was shocked by the taste of the dish (she was a butcher for many years).The Guru Curry $7.50 is made like a thin Thai curry so don't expect a thick Indian or Chinese curry. It is soupy but it is very good and is served with a crusty loaf of bread. It is composed of: curry, taro, carrots, potatoes, gluten, tofu.The small trick she offered us about their water is that they cut up a bunch of oranges and put it in the ice water. The Macadamia Carrot Cake $3.95 could have been better if it wasn't so dried out by the refrigerator. It was a delicious cake but they need to throw those out and replace them. With: coconut, carrots, turbinado, sugar, macadamia nuts, spices, coconut cream topping.Please men in the back who kept farting; I know vegans have a lot of fiber running through the digestive tract at an astronomical rate but farting in a full restaurant is in poor taste. Please excuse yourself and go to the bathroom and fart to your heart's content or take it outside. *Disclaimer-none of the people pictured were the purveyors of the gas.All items are 100% vegan, all entrees are under $10, all of their delicious organic juices, milks and teas are $3.50-5.00.  It gets busy on weekends and with the already long wait, prepare to wait or come early.Might be hard to pass up but it is right across from Chuy's, and right in the same parking lot as Desert Jade.

Review Text :
Stay away. Far away.I had been hearing about Fate for a while. I had high expectations, since I had been to Lucky Dragon in the past (the owners prev joint) which was OK.It was the worst Chinese/Asian I've had in AZ, the service was terrible, the chairs uncomfortable, and to top it off my fiancee got food poisoning.... and has been sick for the last 2 days from it. I took her to the ER this morning at 4:30 AM and decided to finally start posting on Yelp since I've been a lurker for a while.Aesthetics:Initially looks like a typical hipster restaurant like you might find in another city. Nice patio, cool inside.  However... The seating at a bus stop is more comfy. There is no chair back - just this high bar thing that digs into your back.I'm going to file this under aesthetics - we ordered the Hot and Sour soup (more on that later) and the waitress suggested it was large enough to share. However, they apparently don't have any kind of serving utensil, so we had to use our little soup spoons to serve ourself soup into another bowl out of this wide shallow terrine. WTF?Service:I don't know a nicer way to say it, our waitress was a dopey bimbo. It took 20 minutes for her to take our order. She went missing for long periods of time when I had an empty water glass, and then for a while longer after I tracked her down and asked for some. Not good.Food:I ran into a friend there, and he commented at how he loved the food and was surprised we didn't like it. To be blunt, it was utter crap. The hot and sour soup was thin and spicy. That's it. It tasted like chiles and a splash of rice wine vinegar- no other flavors present. It's not like any hot and sour soup I ever had.... in a bad way. There are these weird chewy dumplings like things in it that would be better served at protecting the floor from your chair leg. I ordered some Saigon basil something or other dish with beef, she ordered the Lemon Grass whatever with tofu.My dish was bad. The beef was sliced thin but tough and chewy, and totally lacked flavor. As for basil, there were 2 small basil leaves in the dish, and that's it. The sauce was thin and one dimensional. Her lemon grass dish was also bad. The sauce tasted like Tom Yum paste from the chinese grocery store mixed with some water. I felt bad for the poor abused tofu.I'm not a big fan of chain restaurants.... but Pei Wei and Pickup Sticks are about 10x better in terms of food quality and taste. Screw that, even the chinese place in the mall food court is better. I am not exaggerating. It was a very disappointing meal.Now for the nasty part.I drank water - Fiancee unit drank th 'Green Tea.' It was like no other green tea I ever had seen. It was leprechaun green, with some kind of milk like substance in it.I thought it looked kinda funky, but she drank it.It was the only difference between our meals. I tried hers, she tried mine, etc. I didn't drink the science experiment tea.Well... Several hours later she started having stabbing stomach pains. She spent the whole night up vomiting and with diarrhea.  2 days later the vomiting has subsided but she's missed 2 days of school and is still pooping up a storm. I took her to the ER at 4:30 AM this morning and they confirmed the symptoms were consistent with food poisoning. Admittedly she had just gotten back a 45 days ago from a trip to a 3rd world country where she got (and recovered from) a tropical disease so her immune system is not at it's strongest right now, but come on. This shouldn't be the end result. Plus this IS downtown Phoenix so there are plenty of people around with compromised immune systems, if you know what I mean, due to lifestyle choices.There is some great Asian food in Central Phoenix. Maxim and Da Vang are great Vietnamese places on 19th ave.The Cultural Center has a few great places, esp Golden Buddha. Thai Lahna has been consistently good for years.Like I said I don't eat a lot of chain food - but even the Pei Wei at 7th ave and McDowell is way better in terms of food quality.I really enjoy the atmosphere however the food is worse than a microwave dinner. I think the buy bing bags of stirfry from costco!!We got there and they didnt seat us for 30mins. When there were tables. Then we got seated and didnt get the food for 1 and a half hours. We kept trying to grab the witress but she would avoid us. Then we would ask othe waitresses and they said the would check.People were coming and going that got there after us!!!Finally I got aggressive with our waitress and we saw her walk to the chef and put in our order!!!She forgot to put in our order!!!Since she wanted to pretend like it was just taking a long time she fucked the whole order up because she was going off memory and couldnt ask us because then we would know.The food came finally and it was all crap we didnt even order!!!We told her to forget the whole thing we are leaving and not paying.She grabbed her manager who told us. "she is on thin ice with the owner who is right there. I can take it off the bill but there is a good chance we will get her fired. Or the waitress will pay for half out of her pocket"WTF!!!!!!!!!!!Of course I told her the whole meal needs to be free and it was extremely unprofessional that she would blame a waitress getting fired because we waited a total of 2 hrs for the wrong meals we didnt eat!!It would have been rated a zero star but I gave it 2 because now they are a bar too and that portion is pretty cool.

Review Text :
What I was thinking on the way to los taquitos:"I hate that Guy Fieri.  What a jerk.  First of all, he pronounces his last name all Italian, and I am 100% certain that he pronounced it like a full on american all his life until he made it on Food Network.  Then, he gets to drive around and taste greasy food all day.  Plus, he looks high as a kite sometimes on air, which probably makes the food even better.  Anywhere from 1-4 reasons to be jealous/annoyed with the guy, depending on who you are."Also:"I wish God would smite Beyonce.  Her songs are the most annoying songs I've ever heard.  If there were a way for her to get smacked into permanent silence, I'd be all for it."And:"I can't wait to eat at this place.  Street tacos sound delish.  Where is it?  Wait--this looks like a residential neighborhood.  Where the hell am I?"Ultimately I find the place and go in.  There's some floozy outside with a huge rack--only pertinent because she ended up being an employee.  Well I guess it isn't really pertinent then, either.Anyway, I'm *wanting* to like this place.  I long to be able to say that I went to a place today and ate food that tasted like pureed happiness.  I want to give this place five stars and brag right and left that this is the place to be.But I don't.  The service was good--the girl was nice (bc of an earlier review I was expecting the worst) and she told me the street tacos were the way to go.  I got the three tacos, one chicken, one carnitas, one steak (asada).  Plus rice and beans.  On corn tortillas.  And I got a sexy-looking bottle of coke.When the food came out, I was devastated.  Where my three tacos should have been, I had three walniut-sized excuses for tacos.  Where my beans covered in mexican cheese should have been, I got beans covered in an afterthought of some white cheese (which isn't what I wanted.  Sue me).  Where my rice should have been there was rice.  1 for 3.The street tacos all tasted ostensibly the same.  That punk Guy Fieri on Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives on Food Network made it sound like I'd wet myself with glee upon eating the carnitas, and the lady making the batch acted like they'd be good enough to keep part of the recipe a secret.  They aren't.  That recipe should be open source for sure, so that maybe someone can come along and improve it.  I certainly could.Anyway--maybe it was because he was high as a f*&^ing kite but the food did not taste like magic, it tasted like hot sauce.  And I am all for hot sauce--I'll bitchslap a habanero or two, no problem.  But the issue is that whatever I ate, it tasted like only the hot sauce.  I added green sauce--still the same flavor.  I wanted to be wowed, but instead I thought, "Meh.  I've experienced better."  Which is why you see two stars here.In fact, I don't blame Los Taquitos for doing what they do.  Whatever is fine by me.  But now I kinda wanna slew-foot Guy Fieri just that little bit more for telling me that this place was so good.  If you're gonna tell the world what's delicious, don't smoke out first, because I've been there and eaten a piece of my cat's litter and it tasted pretty decent to me at the time.  Hardly a reliable indicator of a culinary masterpiece.A couple of disclaimers: I don't hate Guy, I have no idea if he smokes out, I'm not judging him or you, stoner.  But I am judging that very average set of tacos.I recently met with the lovely Georgie S. for lunch at good ol Los Taquitos. I am absolutely certain that I gained no less than seven pounds in this sitting between the bean & cheese with Pico De Gallo burrito and the Chile Relleno. Yeah, that is right, I ordered and ate two full meals. What can I say; I like good food. Especially Mexican food. Little shop (Probably 10-15 tables) conveniently sandwiched in between Walgreen's and Safeway so you don't end up shopping on an empty stomach. That could be really dangerous. Cheap. Filling. Fattening. Yummy.My coworkers go to Los Taquitos for the women, I go to Los Taquitos for the tacos. Specifically, the hard shell tacos. They are literally the best hard shell tacos I have ever had in my entire life. Carne asada, chicken, fish, it doesn't matter, they're all delicious and incredibly flavorful.There is nothing glamorous at all about this place. Strip mall location, plastic tables and silverware, whole nine yards.  That said, the food really is fantastic and the price is right. I usually get out of there at lunch somewhere between $6-$8 and I aint mad at that.Just do yourself a favor and don't go during the week their episode airs on Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives on the Food Network as the line is out the door.My g-chat status has been set to "Los Taquitos FTW!" for about three weeks now. No, not because I am too lazy to change it, because I pretty much eat Los Taquitos every single day. If you are a follower of mine, you have probably learned by now that I have an obsessive personality, especially when it comes to food. The problem is, it is SO good here I JUST CANNOT STOP.I cannot eat the a-la-carte Chile Relleno anymore (not vegan), but it is so freaking good and I really wish I could. My friend recently got it in burrito form and I think it was true love.Dallas G. loves the bean burrito with a little guac on the side. There is something about their beans that make you salivate just thinking about them.But, here is what just makes my soul sing: The three hard taco combo. I get it with beans (no meat) and no cheese, and add pico. I get all beans with no cheese on the side. I lather that ish up with the green sauce, and suddenly all is right in the world.The clock just struck 8:30am... guess what that means? That's Right! TACO TIME!can we have a moment of silence for the carnitas street tacos?let's pay our respect for the carne asada. what is the secret ingredient in those beans?? i can't pin point it but those beans are something else. we wanted to try it all, so naturally, it was the 3 item combo platter: 1 taco, 1 tamale, 1 enchilada. the friendliest girl told us they were known for street tacos and we should have listened. everything on the plate was great but it was all about that taco. i thought i knew delicious but it reached a whole 'notha level after eating here. my recommendation: street taco combo plate w carne asada and DEFINITELY carnitas. then drizzle on some of that green salsa they have. welcome to bliss.they are a tad inconsistent but it's still really good, some days are just off the charts goods.One bite and I was transported back to the crowded streets of Monterrey.  I could almost smell the exhaust of the vochos and hear the distant conversation of the local policia extorting their prescribed mordida.  Quite simply, this is the taco as the way it was intended by its creators.  The pure and unadulterated classic enjoyed by the Mexican working class.What Pomo is to pizza, this place is to tacos.  Authentic...absolutely authentic.I've been wanting to try Los Taquitos even before I knew it had been on Diners, Drive-ins and Dives and I finally got the chance.  The inside it exactly what I expected, nothing fancy, booths and some tables.  I found it a little odd that the counter where you order is so small and the drink lids, napkins, condiments and plasticware are right next to it.  If there had been a line it would have been very awkward.  I ordered a chicken burrito, enchilada style with rice and beans and a drink.  When I went to get my drink they were out of Diet Coke, it came out as just water.  Ok, I thought maybe they had been super busy as it was about 1pm on a weekday.  Lunch rush perhaps.  I took a seat and waited for my number to be called.  The burrito was good, nothing that knocked my socks off but a decent burrito.  The rice was nice and fluffly but the beans just lacked flavor.  They were blah.  Will I come back?  Sure but I will try the tacos next time and hope that they can rearrange that counter a bit.This is a great hole in the wall family owned Mexican restaurant. I have not had a bad thing on the menu. Their street tacos are some of the best. You can choose the type of meat you want in them. You can even get all three in the combo different. The Torta is awesome and the burritos are mouth watering.Service is great. It gets a little cramped waiting for your order because the place is really that small. The prices are good too. Sure there isn't a dollar menu but who needs one when the food is this good. Dollar menus are for places with horrible food.It can get packed around lunch time so be warned. Calling you order in will save on time if you only have an hour for lunch.I have been going here for years and will keep coming back.While visiting Arizona some co-workers of mine were recommending places to eat when the name Los Taquitos came up. With Mexican food being one of my favorite types of ethnic eats I knew while in the area I would definitely have to give this place a try and I'm glad I did.Situated in a safe and standard strip mall sits this spectacular site sure to satisfy your stomach. I walked in to see some very nice art of what appeared to be Santa Muerte or some other skeletons on the wall and placed my order. Per a recommendation from a co-worker I ordered the "bombero pollo".  Once my order was ready it was time to head back to my office and consume this.The bombero pollo was a chicken burrito with some hot sauce and cheese on the outside, I also got beans and rice with it. To start with the entree the hot sauce on the outside really gives this a lot of its flavor. It's fairly hot and I was warned ahead of time, but I'm no chicken, I merely eat chickens, on a burrito. The chicken and other ingridients were good, a little watery. Overall I was very impressed with the bombero pollo as the hot sauce was a great compliment.The rice and beans left a little to be desired. These tasted worse than the ones I get at my local Mexican restaurant in suburban Chicago. I'm willing to take a stab in the dark and guess they were frozen and thawed out due to the somewhat bunchy and odd consistency of bean dip. That's not to say they were bad, just not ideal or on par with what I've had other places.Overall, I really liked the Bombero Pollo, the hot sauce gives it a fantastic flavor. I'm a big fan of Mexican food and this place was fantastic and I would highly recommend it if you happen to be in Phoenix looking for some caliente lunch or dinner. Cinco stars for Los Taquitos.Top-notch Mexican food from an unassuming storefront in an otherwise generic shopping center.  I was turned on to Los Taquitos by a friend who, despite certain dietary restrictions, will indulge in the tacos here when she needs her street food fix.  Coming from California, I have been mystified and befuddled by the lack of good, cheap Mom-and-Pop Mexican food joints in the Phoenix Metro Area.  It seems that when I have gone out exploring, I have been completely disappointed with bland, underseasoned, cafteria-style Mexican food that seems to be de rigeur in these parts.  This is not the case with Los Taquitos.The food here is a tremendous value.  You spend no more than you would at any other Mexican food hole-in-the-wall, but the flavor and attention to texture and food preparation is exceptional.  The hard-shell tacos have the proper jaw-rattling crunch, and the meat is well-seasoned and tasty.  They don't require too much hot sauce because they are so savory on their own, but the house-made green and red sauce condiments, add the perfect amount of heat and brightness.  I have also sampled the carne asada burrito, served enchilada-style (i.e., smothered in red simmer sauce), and found it to be spot-on as far as texture and taste.  The flour tortilla is soft and sturdy, whereas the beef is toothsome and appropriately salty and spicy.I fear that I have been ruined for all other quick-and-dirty Mexican food joints after eating here.  Los Taquitos sets the bar very high for this niche of restaurant, and the service is prompt despite the crowds of loyal patrons that jam-pack themselves into this small little place for a taste of spicy, savory, satisfying Mexican food heaven.I'm still trying to figure out how I lived seven-ish years in Ahwatukee, and somehow missed out on Los Taquitos! Came here a few weeks back with Yelpers Monica O., Cheryl B., Shannon E. and Rick N. for a lovely workday lunch. If it's your first visit, you absolutely MUST try the infamous street tacos. My first go, I tried the Carne Asada, Pollo, and Fish three taco meal with rice and beans. They were all delicious, but the Carne Asada was the star. Some of the best I've had in a long time. The spices worked well together, and no tough pieces were to be found. The Red Salsa they top everything with is nothing short of amazing. It's not blazing hot, but tastes great. I enjoyed it so much I dragged my Dude back out a Saturday that same week, where we discovered the Carnitas are right up there with the Carne Asada! Very tender, and it tasted like some type of apple and brown sugar rub was used. And again for another workday lunch when I got stuck on a client call and missed a vendor provided lunch.This place is small and gets packed at high noon quickly.Call it a dive; call it a dump. If you're coming here for ambiance (not delicious tacos), you're doing it wrong!I look forward to trying other menu offerings at Los Taquitos, but for now, I'm hung up on those amazing street tacos.Update 9/18: Tried the Bombero Burrito con Pollo. Do not order this if you hate spicy; also, it's massive (see photos) so SHARE. Barely ate half! Was able to sample the Vegetarian tacos, also delicious.I really wanted to like this place : (Hubby had tacos (lengua, asada y pastor) and he said they were the best tacos ever.I did not have any because the extra taco I had ordered for myself... was not actually in my order, so disappointment number one.Service was OK but not particularly friendly.2 - We ordered, sat to wait for our number, and people were coming and going... they seem to pay more attention to people with to go orders than to the customers in their dining room, which is a big turn off for me as a customer. Even a person in a neighboring table made conversation and asked what we had ordered, because he thought we were waiting for a while. Hubby got impatient and went to ask (they were like 10 numbers over our ticket number) and he was told the delay was because of our 'big' order... yeah, 3 tacos, a bowl of menudo and a drink.Well, the menudo was super hot... (are there any regulations about food temperature?  hehe) and in fact very tasty, but super stingy with the meat, I think they were leftovers and honestly they should have said 'we run out' instead of selling me a bowl of hominy. Well, I would have taken it at a discount, but not for regular price.So, it would have been great if it was a regular portion, but it was like 90% hominy, 10% pancita, so that is a big no-no in my book.We don't live anywhere close to this place, so I do not see ourselves coming back. Unless hubby really craves those awesome tacos one of these days.

Review Text :
I just love being the rebel sometimes. You know, like Fonzie. With friends named Pinky and Leather. Hey,  aren't those the bartenders names at Padlock (or whatever the heck it's called now)? My first Pane Bianco sandwich was consumed just seconds ago. The creamy, uber fresh mozzarella is still dripping down my face. The house baked focaccia, crisp and chewy in  all the right places. And loaded with fresh basil, bursting with flavor. The tomatoes, well, the tomatoes were OK. So why am I just satisfied instead of my eyes rolling back into my head and my toes curling up, like when I eat ice cream in bed? I give the sandwich, for me, 3 stars. Not because it's not fantastic. I guess I just tire of eating mozzarella. The texture gets funky to me. But, this place is amazing. And I will go back. But the rebel in me must tell you what WAS 5 stars today. Julie's organic Carolina gold rice pudding.  I'm sitting in a tub right now. Go get some. Oh, I'm sorry, you can't. I got the last one!!!I of course have a crush on Chris Bianco. Not because of his rugged good looks or what could be hiding behind his fly but because of his ideals and passions. He is committed to the finest ingredients.. the best techniques and has the knowledge to pull it all together almost daily with consistency. I admire what he does and it simply shows in all that he makes. PB for me is hands down the best place in town for a great rustic sandwich. The flavors and textures are simple yet when combined offer a complexity that's hard to beat. Down to earth this place directly reflects the passion of it's owner. Chris Bianco should run for president.. no bs.. no lying about WMD.. just true and real, honest to goodness.The best sandwich I've ever had is hands down Chris Bianco's amazing housemade mozzarella, local tomato and basil sandwich. All his sandwiches are delivered on amazing pane (Italian bread) with ingredients of the highest quality - as at Pizzeria Bianco. If I stop by with less hunger I usually go for the house made focaccia, the pieces are large enough to practically be considered a slice of deep dish pizza. They're topped with a different combination daily and are heated in the wood fired oven before being wrapped up - it's amazing for half the price of the sandwich.Be warned that seating is only outdoors, but the tables are covered by shade with water misters. So depending on the weather this usually isn't that big of a deal. And if you are really brave you may venture next door into Lux for a cool drink and an escape from the outdoor tables.This is a wonderful spot for a casual lunch or for bringing people from out of town. The lines are not nearly as long as they are at Pizzeria Bianco.... yet.Oh Pane Bianco....your little caramel cremes at the bottom of the bag knock you up to a 4 star review.  I love caramel cremes, but really l am at a 3.5 with you.  Honestly, I would go down to a 3 but...those caramels save you.I'll be real.  The sandwiches are good.  Best mozzarella I've ever had? No.  (The Italian deli in the town my parents live in has amazing mozzarella) Best caprese sandwich I've ever had? No.  (Oh Oxford Spa...how I miss you so.....your Thesis is so yummy...)   Best caprese sandwich in the Valley? Perhaps.  I was not impressed with the bread by any means....there was nothing truly stellar about it.  And I found the soprasetta to be very salty.  I know Italian meats can sometimes be salty but this was a little much.The extremely limited menu and the fact they aren't open on Mondays takes a star off right there.  The space is kind of barren.  I'm used to Italian sandwich shops being light, airy, welcoming and warm places.  Pane Bianco was kind of like a sandwich factory.  They have a very limited grocery section which just seemed to me to be for show.  "Let's throw in this grocery section to make it look like an Italian market!"    I don't think the price they charge is justifiable.  I don't know...where I'm from there are plenty of sandwich shops where you can get just as good, if not better, of a sandwich (from a much larger selection) AND a drink AND a bag of chips (or salad if you want) for the same price.  At least you do get those caramels...I want to hate you, Pane Bianco. I really really want to hate you. With every fabulous fiber in my being.You have weird hours, an overwhelming "not quite industrial, not quite rustic" decor, and your $8 Mozzarella, Tomato and Basil salad consists of a cut up tomato and a few, uh, "slugs" of mozzarella topped with soggy basil leaves. But the real reason I want to hate you is that you duped me. You bamboozled, shanghaied and probably even Kansas City Shuffled me too.You lured me into this false sense of disappointment with my tiny salad and loaf of bread rolled up in a piece of paper.You watched me eat it too, didn't you?You saw me take a big chunk out of one of those cheese slugs. You watched me enjoying that salad. That delicious, gooey salad.And you liked it, didn't you? You liked watching me scarf down that salad like it was an item from a value menu. You got a sick kick out of seeing me tear through that bread like I'd never had it so good. You bastard.I want to hate you. I want to give you two stars and rant and rave about how you teh lame.But I can't. I just can't. That salad was just, like, whoa. That had to be the freshest mozzarella and the freshest tomatoes I'd ever tasted.It made olive garden salad taste like bagged lettuce doused in olive oil.And if Subway made bread as fresh as yours, I would stop going in there periodically to order the seafood sensation (toasted!) just to watch the employees and other patrons moan and cringe. I want to hate you. But that bait and switch, luring me in with that "too cool for you" vibe and then hitting me up with some flava, that takes skill. That takes cunning.And as a woman who spent her youth tying bedsheets around her neck and trying to burn the neighbor's house down with her mind, I appreciate cunning.Four stars for being cunning, and one star for being leaps and bounds of awesome ahead of Lux. I don't care if it's vegan. It's still a cupcake, you're still a grown up, and eating it while surfing the web on your flashy new laptop does not make you look any less ridiculous.The 5 Stars let you know where I stand. Uniquely awesome sammiches on crazy fresh Umbrian-style bread. You cannot go wrong.So just a tip:keep calling and checking to see if one of the following is the market sammich that day. - crumbled sausage and melted mozzarella - pulled pork - pulled lamb If it is one of the above, in that order, drop whatever you're doing and get there as fast as you can. Also, do not ignore the market focaccia. Even if it just looks like a pile of veggies on a sheet pan pizza, it is fantastic.I am not on the Chris Bianco bandwagon. I think his pizza is ok, but not nearly worth an hour wait, let alone the 3 to 4 hour actual wait. But one thing that MF can make better than anyone else is fresh mozzarella. I love mozzarella.So, without the wait, I can head to Pane Bianco and get a mozzarella sandwich with fresh basil and tomatoes on Bianco's fresh baked bread (it all sounds very fresh).Don't ask me about any other sandwich because I don't know. Nor do I care. Fresh mozzarella. Some people talk about the goat cheese sandwich. Who cares? Fresh mozzarella!Most people think of pizza when they hear Chris Bianco. All I can think of is fresh mozzarella.As any normal person would when trying a place that has 4.5 stars based on 70 reviews (and that just *happens* to be related to the notorious Pizzeria Bianco, where people wait hours upon hours for pizza), I had very high expectations for Pane Bianco. I expected to bite into my sandwich and be wowed. While I really enjoyed the mozzarella and soppressata sandwiches we split and certainly found them both more enjoyable than many sandwiches I have had in the Phoenix area, I just don't think this place is deserving of the Salvation Army of fans that seems to be willing to fight a holy war for that mozzarella sandwich. In my eyes, what makes Pane Bianco's sandwiches good (and still worthy of 3 stars) is the fact that they are simple. Unlike some yuppy establishments where Arcadia ladies "lunch" (think Wildflower, Acacia Cafe or Chelsea's Kitchen), Pane Bianco (and by the transitive property, Chris Bianco) clearly has the European sensibility of "less is more." A sandwich doesn't need to be piled high with garlic aioli, carmelized onions, and herb goat cheese to be good. If the ingredients are high enough quality, the bread and a few fillings should be able to stand alone and make for a great sandwich. I guess that's where my problem with Pane Bianco comes in. The individual ingredients of the sandwiches just weren't that great. Certainly, the mozzarella is good but I have had better mozzarella from nice local grocery stores and of course, at countless Italian places. I also agree with Kristin S that the soppressata was overly salty, which obscured the flavor. Finally, I didn't think the bread was as delicious as I had pictured it would be many times before actually coming. It certainly tasted fresh but I thought it could have a bit more flavor complexity (as it was, it tasted very white-bread and didn't have the slightly sour kick that housmade bread often does. I've got to be honest that after trying Pane Bianco, I am convinced that I would be a bit disappointed if I waited in line to eat at PIzzeria Bianco. While I can definitely appreciate a simple but delicious Pizza Margherita in a world where buffalo chicken pizza is somehow an appealing dish, the individual pizza ingredients would have to be better than the ones at Pane Bianco for me to truly feel like the wait was worth it.If Pizzeria Bianco is so ballyhooed about that it has an almost mythic status... then Pane Bianco could almost be seen as the less famous step-child of the family. Here is an analogy for you... I hope you remember how these work from your high school days:Alec Baldwin is to Stephen Baldwin as Pizzeria Bianco is to ______?...how did you do? If you filled in the blank with "Pane Bianco", then congratulations... give yourself a pat on the back and 3 extra credit points. Just a hop, skip and a jump north of downtown Phoenix lies this little unassuming storefront. If you didn't know any better, you'd never guess that some of tastiest sandwiches in the valley are being cooked up inside. Similar to Pizzeria Bianco, there is a focus on fresh local ingredients and simplicity. Don't expect a dazzling and varied menu, but do expect a small selection of sandwiches which they really know how to cook well. I always love it when a place has a small menu of things that they do great, rather than an extensive menu of things they do just OK. Last time we went, we were able to get one of each sandwich on the menu (it's not as impressive as it sounds... they only have three sandwiches along with one rotating special). Each one had unique flavor and tasted really fresh.... our favorite might be the simplest one they have; the mozzarella/tomato/basil sandwich... yum yum. They have a way of always cooking the bread perfectly, so it has this slightly burnt crisp to it; it's almost like you're eating a sandwich made out of really good pizza crust.There's really not too much bad to say about this place, they serve great fresh sandwiches for a pretty reasonable price. If you do go though, there is occasionally a little bit of a wait... and it's strictly a 'to-go' place, so there's no indoor seating (there are picnic tables outside in the front). If you do have a little wait time to get your food, be sure to go next door to Lux where you can get a pretty good cup of coffee/tea and laugh at the sheer volume of trendy hipsters completely enamored in their MacBooks. 4.25/5.I forgot to review my birthday lunch......damn it anyways! I wanted to try some of Mr. Biancos offerings but did not want to wait 3 hours for pizza so we decided to come here.I figured it would be my only trip here in quite some time so I decided to get 2 sandwiches.  I got the tomato, basil and mozarella.  And I also got the sopresetta and provlone with roasted peppers. The sopresetta was one of the top 5 sandwiches I have ever had.  It was absolutely perfect.  Not a whole lot of meat, but the flavor was super delicious!  The roasted red peppers and sharp provolone blended well and it was on some amazing bread.  Basically pizza crust.  SO GOOD!The tomato sandwich was meh.  Im not the biggest fan of tomatos to begin with and when I tried I bite I knew why ;-).  I picked them out and basically ate a mozarella sandwich.  This one got a little soggy too. About 8 bucks each which was ok by me.  The candy they give you in the bag is a super small caramel.  It was good, but nothing to rave about.  One bite and it was dust.  If I ever come back to Phoenix I will definitley stop by and get a sopresetta sandwich.  It was amazing!I am bumping this up to 5 stars.  My buddy and I came here 2 days in a row for lunch.  I got the sopresetta sandwich each time and I found a new appreciation for it.  It is so darn simple, yet so damn tasty.  The mix of the slightly greasy/salty meat, combined with the flavor of the roasted red peppers and sharp....almost hard.....provolone cheese, stuffed in between that delicious bread they use=in my top 5 favorite sandwiches EVER!Totally expect to get my ass kicked by the serious Pane Bianco devotees on here, but oh well. Meh. I don't like paying $10+ for a sandwich, and then almost $4 for a side, and $2-3 for a bottle of water/bottle of soda. That is not an acceptable lunch option to me. Especially when I have yet to patron Pane Bianco one time and not been hungry an hour later. This is the freakin' sushi bar of the sandwich world.While I'll agree that the ingredients are fresh, you get so few of them it would be difficult to know otherwise. I've been several times now and pretty much always get the tomato/mozz sandwich as I don't eat tuna salad or have a taste for sopressatta. The other day however I got the market sandwich and I was so excited to be able to try something new because it had turkey in it. 2 whole super thin supermarket looking slices of turkey. Mmmmmm. Delicious giant pieces of bread with two super thin slices of turkey in the middle. How could I say anything nasty about paying $10 for you? How dare I be hungry an hour later when you made me so full with all of that bread? You get the picture. Stick the the tomato/mozz sandwich if you're heading this way. Oh, and make sure someone else is picking up this ludicrous tab.Yay dinner!!!It's no big secret that I'm a huge fan of Chris Bianco. His simple honest to goodness approach to food is not only inspiring but down right delicious. If you're one of his fans who don't mind waiting 4 hours for one of his amazing pies at Pizzeria Bianco, then you're in for a real treat. While they don't serve pizza, one of my all time favorites, Pane Bianco is now serving dinner and no serious wait either! In addition to ordering one of their famous sandwiches, you can expect an ever changing menu of rustic Italian inspired plates.If you've been to Pane you know the drill, go in, order at the counter then either decide to take your score home, or eat there on one of the communal outdoor tables. No wine or beer is served at this time but there is talk of Pane expanding into the Lux Coffee space next door which will eventually offer inside seating and hopefully wine by the glass. If all of this goes down, Lux will simply move to the adjacent building also getting a larger space. For me Bianco's food just screams for a glassed of red wine.Ordering the Crespelle ($12) had me really excited due to the unique nature of the dish itself. Basically an Italian crepe made the garbanzo bean flour; it's filled with luscious ricotta cheese, hints of spinach then bathed in a slightly sweet tomato sauce. It was clear that after the first bite I was in love with this dish, I simply couldn't stop though glares from my dining companions made me to relinquish the plate. I can't sing enough praises for Biancos Housemade Mozzarella ($8), thick slabs of hand pulled cheese is paired with fresh tomatoes, a few leaves of basil, olive oil and a sprinkling of salt, that's it. The resulting texture and flavor is so toothsome and fresh that I've yet to have another as good. The salad comes with bread which I put to good use soaking up every drop of the salads milky elixir. Served on house made flat bread, the Soppressata with Aged Provolone ($8) which also comes topped with a healthy shave of Parmesan cheese and slices of roasted onion. The pungency from the provolone is a nice compliment to the pork-tastic slices of soppressata. Bianco is dedicated to local purveyors and for good reason, they make some of the best Phoenix has to offer. Take the Sausage with beluga lentils and polenta ($10) for instance. The sausage comes from our very own Schreiner's Fine Sausages over on 7th Street and let me just say, this plump link had just the right amount of meaty well seasoned punch to compliment the hearty lentils and super moist polenta cake.If you're more of a lighter eater, I'd suggest the highly flavorful Roasted Seasonal Vegetables ($5). On my last visit the pan was filled with long thick spears of asparagus, sweet potato, cabbage, radishes, broccolini and cloves of garlic. Grab a loaf of their chewy bread ($3) and you have yourself a vegetarian option even a meat eater like me would love.Now if they added pizza to the menu, my life would be complete.Love is in the air... yes, Valentines Day is around the corner, but the love is really about the spontaneous lunch date I had the other day at Pane Bianco.For those wondering, my date was with my husband.  We left the baby at home (with a babysitter of course), and went out for a few hours to enjoy the beautiful weather.  After a stop at the Downtown Phoenix Public Market, we were both hungry and finally agreed to head to PB.  I hate to admit this, but it was my first time there... I had high expectations and PB delivered!  We sat outside on the picnic tables instead of taking advantage of the full service inside.  We shared a tomato mozzarella sandwich and a tuna salad.  Both were delicious!  Melt in your mouth delicious!  We also brought home their market sandwich for our babysitter (aka my mother-in-law).  It was a vegetable sandwich which she said was delicious.I'd heard the menu was limited, which it was, but there was still plenty to choose from.  I can't wait to return for lunch or dinner... and perhaps to take advantage of their private little room in back.  Anyone up for a little dinner party at Pane Bianco?!This is the perfect lunch spot. It's perfect for those who need an hour escape from a cubicle, it's perfect for those meeting friends for a leisurely lunch, it's perfect for a solo diner and it's perfect for a casual meeting. A sit-down restaurant lives on one side and a takeout market (with outdoor seating) lives on the other. The atmosphere is very farm-to-table'esque and lets out a fresh breathe of an open and airy environment of fresh products and friendly kitchen. The food here is what you would expect from Chris Bianco: pure perfection. The bread is fresh and fluffy, the cheese is creamy and the meats are grade A. The menu is extremely limited, but it still offers something for every appetite. They have a couple salads and a couple sandwiches, but be sure to ask about their daily specials. I had the pleasure of visiting Pane Bianco today for a business meeting and decided to enjoy the special. The special today was a prosciutto sandwich with melted cheese and tomato paste. The tomato paste really made the sandwich. The entire sandwich was filling without stuffing me and delightful with every bite. I think that it can be hard for individual diners to find a lunch spot that's comfortable for a "table for one." Luckily Pane Bianco is the perfect environment for this thanks to the takeout market and picnic tables in front.I have been coming to Pane Bianco since before the twins were born and before they expanded.  I love my fresh Mozzarella sandwich.  I had an appointment in downtown PHX, so I could finally get a fix.  It had been a few months since I had been able to go and get my sandwich.  I do agree with Iain B.  $10 for a sandwich is pretty hefty, but I cannot help but stop by when I am without the twins.  I was able to sit down at one of the picnic tables outside, yes it was hot, but that is why I live in AZ,  and enjoy my book while I ate my yummy treat.  My husband usually gets the Market sandwich, I had a taste of a few, they are really good, but nothing beats my choice.* FRESH LOCAL INGREDIENTS made with love ** Serves same pizza as Pizzeria Bianco but has spacious seating *before going to the airport, we had two more hours to kill. decided to check out Lux Cafe and what do we see?  PANE BIANCO!!! IT'S A SIGN!! heheh.  we were planning to visit pizzeria bianco and pane bianco on our weekend getaway. thought we were going to leave phoenix without it but we already dined at pizzeria bianco. we weren't planning to actually eat too much. no pizza this time since we wanted to try other items.it's a HUGE space. i recommend people to visit pane bianco versus pizzeria bianco since you can 1) seat more, 2) there isn't a line, 3) they serve the pizza. in fact, i like the rustic decor. brendan told us that lux cafe used to be in half the space until they acquired their own building next door. pane bianco was able to become much bigger.i was asking brendan so many questions, cuz that's what i do!! haha..he was more knowledgeable than the waitresses at pizzeria bianco or the cashier girl at pane bianco. guess it's not everyday people like me appear.  brendan was probably thinking that that was the reason they tell you what they use, the process, the history when he was hired to work there. some diner like me would be testing him. (he passed. heheh)on the board, there is a daily special. happy hour is 3-7pm daily -- $2 off beers.(the foccacia sandwiches are on the lunch menu)complimentary bread with EVOO. i felt that the bread here was slightly better than the one at pizzeria bianco. but really, it's the same bread.meatballs (side order) - i had my eyes on the meatballs...staring at the photos on the computer screen, so i knew this was what we were having. 3 good sized meatballs made from GRASS FED BEEF with crushed tomato sauce that was divine and a basil leaf. LOVE LOVE!!! market salad - they change it up daily/monthly but they follow a flavor palate. this time, it was a lighly dressed citrus viniagrette on a bed of arugula, oranges, candied pecans, and goat cheese. just what we were looking for.when we were at pizzeria bianco, we were so full that we didn't get to try dessert.this time, we ordered the vanilla rice pudding. when i was reading about it, other people said that it was enough for two.  well, it was a much more generous portion than i had imagined!!  it was topped with boysenberry jam and not too sweet.  perfect ending to our 'light' meal'.there are currently two pizzeria biancos (we didn't go to the other location) and one pane bianco. plans are in the works to expand adding a pizzeria bianco in tucson for the future. FIRST STOP, Pizzeria Bianco.LAST STOP, Pane Bianco.HAPPY EATING!!! =D

Our team chose this place to have breakfast 2nd year in a row before our team build activity. I guess we spend so much time together we're starting to think alike because all 6 of us ordered the same thing, the chicken fried steak, gravy & eggs! Six people can't be wrong, we all cleaned our plates! I thought it was better than my usual favorite go to restaurant for chicken fried steak breakfast. This place appears to be a little hole in the wall Cafe but it was certainly busy, has great food and service to match,  one of those tucked away places that is a must try!

I went here a couple weeks ago and was pleased with my cheese steak. I had it then with just the meat and cheese. Today when I returned, the guy at the counter asks, "With onions and mushrooms?" Okay, yeah. "Sweet or spicy peppers?" Spicy, please. And what I received knocked the socks off that earlier sandwich. This place is tiny, cramped, a bit chaotic and is apparently cooled by wall-mounted fans. Yet I can see myself going here on a regular basis. So, the next time you're having one of those moments, like Ameerah A, opt for the cheese steak. Just be sure to let me know before hand so we can meet up.

Restaurant name  Indian Delhi Palace
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
First off, I must say, friendly smiles upon entering an establishment goes a looooong way for me. Family owned and nurtured with love comes through at Indian Delhi Palace. I've eaten in a few times and mostly had take out. Service was always right on, attentive not intrusive. Take out packaging is an art in my book. So often, things are forgotten, mispackaged and spilled and well, sometimes just tossed in a bag. Here they do it right. Garlic naan bread in house is better than to go. Unfortunately they wrap it in tinfoil and it sweats and loses any of it crispy outer crunch. Chicken tikka marsala has just enough cream and spice to hit all my F spots (you know like a G spot, only F for flavor!). Saffron rice is fluffy, flavorful and fantastic. Rickie loves their sauteed okra...generally not something high on my list to order but yowza Potsie...dee - lish. Samoras, tandori chicken all A's all around. And you can't beat a tall, cold Himalyan beer while waiting for that to go order and they always provide me with some papadum and a tangy, sour, spicy dip. Remember a smile goes along way with me!Coda B. and I both crave Indian Lunch Buffets when we're hungover. Him more so than me. He's actually called me at 12:30 at night, from a bar, talking about how he wants Indian Food. It's as though he can already feel the hangover coming on and wants to make sure his priorities are in check. 1) Get home (or wherever) safely 2) Indian Food. I may have mixed up the order.This Indian Delhi Palace is apparently under the same ownership as the Tempe location, but I like this one much better. For several reasons:1) The Chicken Tikka Masala is AMAZING. Like, I've never had buffet food this good before. I don't really like Tandoori Chicken. Honestly, the color kind of freaks me out. I know it's from the sauce or whatever, but chicken, on the bone, with a kind of fluorescent pink glow is weird. I'll pass. But boneless chicken in a delightful red curry sauce? Don't mind if I DO!2) This location has a much larger variety of dishes, especially vegetarian dishes, which are usually my favorite offerings at an Indian lunch buffet (see above about tandoori chicken freaking me out).3) Um, hello? It looks like a freaking palace. These guys did not hold back and I freaking love them for it. I actually think more places offering a lunch buffet should treat its patrons like the hungover royalty that we are. I wouldn't mind if Souper Salad and Sweet Tomato hopped on this trend already. I mean, how hard can it be to add a few fancy door arches and some gold plated silverware? Not that hard really. Up your game, guys.However, the only complaint I have about Indian Delhi Palace, and the primary reason why Flavors of India remains my favorite Indian Lunch Buffet has to do with the atmosphere. Yes, I appreciate the super sexy high-class water goblets, but Delhi Palace doesn't have any booths. And when I'm hungover, I need a freaking booth. I need my own little eating sofa. I need to be able to kick off my flip flops under the table and sprawl out like I'm enjoying their delicious naan on my own little loveseat. That's what I need, and that's what Flavors of India gives me. Oh, and some Bollywood wouldn't hurt either.I cooked dinner at home the last four nights in a row... this may be a record for me.  No joke!  We eat out way too much.  But, as a reward for all of my cooking as of late, my husband took me out to dinner tonight.I suggested we try Indian Delhi Palace, and he agreed!We walked in and were immediately greeted by Nick, Mr. Delhi Palace's son.  Nick is a college student with one hell of a sense of humor.  The banter between him and Jared made for one comical meal.  Here's what we ate:-Garlic Naan-Peas Pulaou (Basmati Rice cooked with Peas)-Fresh Okra with Sliced Onions, gentle Herbs and mild Spices-Bengan Bhartha (Eggplant roasted in a delightful pulp, seasoned with Gentle Herbs and Mild Spices)-Shrimp Tikka Masala-Kheer (Basmati Rice Pudding sprinkled with almonds and Pistachio)Everything was extremely tasty, especially the okra and shrimp dishes.  I normally do not like dishes that have onion in them, but pretty much everything we had contained a lot of it.  And actually, I still liked it!The serving sizes were large, so we took home leftovers.  The price was a bit steep ($60 out the door), but we really enjoyed it.  I think this will be my new "go-to" place for Indian food, and my new "go-to" place for dinner when I pick up friends and family at the airport around dinner time.As a side note, the Indian Delhi Palace building also has a large banquet room upstairs that Nick showed us upon our inquiry... it has a capacity of 250 and it's really nice.  Future Yelp event potential, perhaps?  We'll see about that.Yes, I am totally deducting a star because they charge for soda refills. Not just charge refill price (which is ridiculous anyway), but charge you for a WHOLE ADDITIONAL SODA when you get a refill. Who the eff does that? I can quite honestly say I'm never going here again, because I only crave Indian when I'm hungover and full flavored (not diet) ice cold coke is a hangover necessity. I'm not going to pay for each one I down, that could bankrupt me. Plus, everyone knows fountain soda costs like 4 cents a piece, who are they trying to fool?

Review Text :
Saturday is Happy Hour day at Sam's Café. Happy because we hadn't been there in a while and happy because Sam's has improved since the last time we were there:)I say "judge slowly" and "give people a second chance" and "a stitch in time, saves nine" and all kinds of other inappropriate adages...but my point is that sometimes a second chance is in order.Sam's Café had been in the rotation for a few years and then we had a couple of poor experiences there, and just didn't go back...you know how it is...there's a lot of competition for the dining dollar (it used to be "dollars" but the recession/depression has hit everyone!).But, this isn't about then...it's about now, so let's get up to date, shall we?The Beautiful Carin and I headed for the club last Saturday to sweat off the weeks caloric build up and sweat it off we did! (you know, I think I sweat so much because I come from ice age survivor stock and here I am trying to live in the desert!).Anyway, after we finished our extremely grueling, yet fulfilling programs of physical exercise, got ourselves all cleaned up, (lookin' good and smellin' sweet) we were talking between ourselves (as married people often do) and trying to figure how to reward ourselves for the excellent workouts we had just finished.How about a nice big lunch?Sam's Café has Happy Hours on Saturday's and Sunday's that run from 11:00 am to 5:00 pm. Well, that's just inspired!We tottered in and sat at the bar (I think that's going to be a defining happy hour "move" for us), and the barman greeted us with a warmth and enthusiasm normally reserved for long lost play cousins...a good start:)We looked at the happy hour menu and they have some nice selections for really good prices.We ordered roast pork sliders with a chipotle barbecue sauce, Carin's  "go-to" selection...grilled chicken nacho's and Sedona Spring Rolls (also served with the chipotle barbecue sauce and pico de gallo).While were waiting for the food to arrive, Sam's minions brought us more food...chips and salsa. Now, I don't want anyone to think Sam's is mexcian food...it's not. The whole place is more "southwest inspired" as opposed to "southwest", or "Mexican" or "authentic". They have décor that looks sort of Fredrick Remington meets Javier Sordo Madaleno...nice, southwest-ish/modern. The chairs in the dining room are, frankly, less than comfortable but they fit the décor, so, OK. Just don't complain to me when they make your butt sore after 20 minutes!Back to the chips and salsa...I like the flour tortilla chips that Sam's serves, as well as the blue corn and sweet potato chips and the salsa is decent as well...very tomatoey, but spicy and flavorful, but it's not Mexican...not for everybody, but we were happy:)The actual food portion of our lunch came before we became completely engorged with the chips portion. Everything was very tasty. The pork roast sliders were truly delightful...moist, seasoned perfectly on soft warm rolls:) (BTW, I'm reasonably certain that you can't get swine flu from eating pork roast, but I will say that the roast pork sliders "flew" off the plate:) . The Sedona Spring Rolls have plenty of spice and heat, and are also very nice.All in all, a very solid Happy Hour offering for $18 and change (before tip).Go, sit at the bar (always better service and your butt will thank me), and enjoy Sam's Happy Hour!

Restaurant name  Zen 32

Review Text :
Darn. I thought I'd be the first to review Zen 32! Hmmm. Apparently the 32 stands for 32nd Street. Zen on 32nd Street. Oh. How terribly clever. I just assumed, after a few visits there, the 32 stood for the number of minutes you wait before your server arrives. I get the style over substance restaurants. Sometimes it's about the scene and not the grub. And sometimes that's what I'm up for. And that's what Zen 32 is to me. Average sushi quality. Not as horrific as some have yelped. Words like. Crap. Horrific. Vomit. Really? Not very Zen of them, eh? I won't go out of my way to think of Zen, but if someone invites me, I'm inclined to say yes. They're open pretty late. By then, I'm ready for some drinks and maybe a bite or two of the fishy. Mostly, it's a place to people watch, visit and take bets on when you'll ever see your server again.I've been to Zen 32 more times than I can count... and for the most part, I've been extremely satisfied with each visit.  I was there for happy hour last night which is what is sparking this review, and it was perfect... we sat outside, enjoyed a couple of beers, and some very reasonably priced sushi.  At $3 a roll, you really cannot complain!I will agree with some of the pluses and minuses that Jenn H wrote about previously, such as:+ A great location+ Very fresh fish+ Low carb rolls+ Good sushi selection+ Neat little complimentary sunomono type appetizer (although we didn't receive ours last night... what's up with that?)+  A really good drink menu+ A great happy hour+ Great atmosphere- Long wait for a table, even when several tables are empty (this has been the case for me on several occasions but luckily, not last night)Wait staff is hit or miss - (luckily our server last night was fine although he didn't have much personality)- Tables really close together (both inside and out)In my case, the positives really outweigh the negatives.  In addition to above, they have a divine bamboo basket of steamed veggies - it includes broccoli, asparagus, sweet potato, carrot, and more. It's served with a light sweet sauce on the side and is the best if you feel like fresh yummy veggies, if you're on a diet, or just want some color to add to the mix of sushi!  Lastly, I left my long sleeve shirt there last night by accident, and luckily the hostess found it no problem when I called.  She was sweet as can be and is holding it for me to pick up today - it sounds like a no brainer, but I'm sure there are plenty of establishments that could F something so simple as that up!I'll be back today to pick up my shirt, but for sure in the future too!

Restaurant name  Cyprus Grill of Phoenix
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
Nestled amongst the many malls along Camelback in the 18th to 24 th Street range, sits Cyprus Pita Grill. A cozy, airy, light filled space with an open kitchen, really hits the target. Again, a fave of John the chef, the beautiful Greek woman in the kitchen smiled at us (ok, she smiled at John). We both ordered the lamb pita and as a side choice, the greek fries. OMG, two words for ya, dee mutha freakin lishus! Man, I'm bad at math. I remember nothing of my math education, except for the crush I had on Mr. Johnson the geometry teacher/football coach/neighbor....and let me tell you he looked good in his bermuda shorts, black socks, shirtless and sweaty mowing his front lawn. But I digress...the fries...heavenly. Fries, cooked to perfection, with lemon juice and feta cheese, oh so good. The pita, was overstuffed with perfectly spiced lamb. Chased with a brisk, refreshing iced tea....a perfect lunch hour for the chef and I. Service was right on...friendly, effecient and professional. It reminded me of a cafe in Mykonos. That I saw on a postcard. OPAH yelpers!P.S. I want to dedicate this review to my friend Tod. No one could put away a Dr. Pepper like my friend Tod. Here's lookin' at you big guy...I love you!Went here with my sis today she never wants to go to FEZ ::sigh:: I had the falafel pita and she had the ceaser one. I had the passion fruit tee yummmmm I almost walked out with the glass I didnt want to put it down it was so good. Our pita's came out hekka quick the giant falafel balls were ok maybe a bit hard and dry in the center but pretty tasty. My sisters chicken was a tad burnt around the edges but she ate it all anyway! Next time I want to try the homemade sangria it sounded lovely!My first experience with Cyprus was about 4 years ago.  My husband was living in the neighborhood, but I was still in denial about moving to the Valley.  It was like a little vacation to come to "the city" and stay in our Biltmore apartment.  The novelty wore off quick once I moved here, but I still enjoy Cyprus.  It makes a nice precursor to a movie at AMC.  At Cyprus, my husband and I can both get get pitas, hummus, and drinks...or we can share the water fountain and 7 kernels of popcorn at the movies for the same price.My favorite part about Cyprus is the pita bread.  It's thick cushy pita, not the flavored cardboard pita they somehow manage to split open to make a pocket.  I'm a little partial to the chicken souvlaki with it's tangy tzatziki sauce, crunchy cucumbers, fresh lettuce and tomato.  The hummus is always tasty, although I seem to remember it being just a little better in the old days.  Not sure if they changed the recipe, or its just me remembering it differently.The only downside, the last two times I've been in we have been waited on by girls.  What happened to the Greek Gods?  Minus a star for that!I'm a fan of this place. Fantastic lunch option if you're on a bit of a health kick, and one of the best value takeaways you're going to find.My friend Sage introduced me to this place a while ago, and I seriously need to return soon. The Wait staff were really on the ball, friendly and personable. We were never left waiting but at the same time no intrusion into conversation.Go and enjoy! :-)How many bites does it take to get to the lamb filled center of a gyros-pop?I'd say one, cause if you can't find gyros on the first bite, there's probably something wrong with your order ;-) ... are you sure you didn't order the chicken?And you thought I was going to say something deep and meaningful, you obviously don't know me that well.Cypress Grill is my favorite place for a gyros in Central Phoenix. There's a handful of them around (gyros spots that is), but if you're looking for a gyros and within a few miles of this place, I'd say skip all the rest. I've tried at least five or so spots that serve em nearby. You'll spend a couple bucks more here than at the other places, with a gyro running you about $8, but I'm happy to conclude that Cypress is my favorite gyro in town.The hummus here is good, so is the spanikopita and dolmades. For those of you who are carb counting, you can get your gyros in a salad too. I've done that a few times myself. All in all a solid choice for medditeranean dining - one of the better spots in the area. Happy Yelping Phoenix!I've eaten here a couple of times and the service has always been friendly and the food quite good. My only suggestion for them would be to make the falafel less dense; other than that, I have no complaints. This is a good place to go for a nice and fast Mediterranean-style meal.My wife and I came here for lunch. This is a great place if you want to eat healthy. It is located in the Town & Country Shopping Center. I haven't been to the Town & Country Shopping Center in 15 -20 years.We were greeted by our waitress Rachel. She took our beverage order and allowed us time to look over the menu. We decided to start off our meal with an appetizer of Spinach and Artichoke dip. It was outstanding. For our entrée I got the chicken Souvlaki Dinner / kebab plate, which came with a generous amount of tender and flavorful chicken breast on two skewers. It was served with rice, pita bread and a Greek salad. The salad consisted of chopped cucumbers and tomatoes with a generous amount of feta cheese.  I also got a side of dolmades. The grilled chicken was moist, and tender. I was able to cut it with a fork. It was surprisingly good. In fact it was much better than some Mediterranean restaurants I've tried. The Dolmades were excellent. Plus the Tzatziki sauce was superb.My wife Carol got the Pork Souvlaki Dinner / kebab. It also came with a Greek salad, rice and pita bread, which she enjoyed. I tried some of the pork and it was delicious. Tender pieces of pork on a skewer marinated and grilled to perfection. Both dishes had lots of flavor.FOOD: The food is deeeelicious AMAZING delicious . When I say "amazing". I definitely mean it.  PRICE: Very reasonable.You get a lot of food for the price. SERVICE:  The service was superb.  AMBIANCE: Low key, nothing fancy, but comfortable.   CONUSION: If you're looking for a fancy restaurant with fancy service...then forget it. If you are looking for amazing Middle Eastern food and absolutely friendly service...welcome home. What a wonderful experience. RETURN  FACTOR: 100%************************* What does my OVERALL rating mean?*************************5 stars -Highly recommended.  I would be willing to drive out of my way to this business. It is that good. This place represents their industry or cuisine very well! 4 stars - Highly Recommended. I would frequent this business. 3 stars - Not that good but not that bad. Just average. I wouldn't mind going again if a friend or family member wanted to go. 2 stars - I would not recommend this establishment to friends or family. 1 stars - DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND DO NOT patronize this business. I would RUN AWAY from this place and you should too! DON'T WAST YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY AT THIS ESTABLISHMENT!

Restaurant name  The Old Spaghetti Factory
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
First of all, their gluten free pasta is really good! It's yellow and made from corn. It's nearly unheard of to see an Italian restaurant (non-chain, chain, authentic or not) have a gluten free option. +1, seriously.I've always liked the Spaghetti Factory. It's not the best but it is dirt cheap and they have so many cool decorations. I'm a sucker for old antique-y looking stuff. The service can be slow and it's always busy, but hell...ALL Spaghetti Factories are this busy if not more. It's not an anomaly people. I'm just happy they have a call-ahead system so you don't have to wait for hours when you arrive.I love the Old Spaghetti Factory.   I have a few vague memories of eating at one as a kid, a college student, and now a full fledged adult.  I came here last night with my date, and we took the light rail.  Walked in, and it was quiet, but it was also a Sunday night.  We only had to wait 5 minutes.  The hostess and what appeared to be a manager were taking names.  The manager was so funny and personanable...when the girl said "what is your name?"  I spelled A-M-Y instead of just saying my dam name....when he called my name he spelled Amy instead! ! LOL. Date and I laughed!We ordered our food with our server, who was nice and knowledegable enough. But, we had to ask for our Bread!  For dinner I ended up with the spaghetti with meat sauce, dinner salad with Balsamic vinigrette dressing and it was tasty!  Date got a cheese pasta dish, and he said it was to cheesy.  O well.Anyways, place and service was fine, will be back, and I still love it here!I had the pleasure of spending my Friendaversary with the lovely Georgie S. this past Sunday at the Opera. Because we saw "La Boheme" I felt it only right to get Italian food, so we headed over to The Old Spaghetti Factory in hopes of satisfying our pasta craving.It was quite charming when our waiter came over with the bottle of wine that we ordered. It was the second most pricey bottle they sold (coming in at $34) and he told us in the four years he worked there he had never sold a bottle that expensive. Well, that's because you don't have high class broads like us patronizing this establishment, or so it would seem!They have a good sized menu with a lot of delicious looking dishes. I was especially excited that they have gluten-free pasta! I was hoping I would be able to eat more than a salad. On that note, I must point out that your meal comes with salad, bread, your entree, and iced tea, AND spumoni for dessert! If you choose not to get the tea and dessert, you get to knock $1.50 off the cost of your meal. That means that my large, tasty plate of pasta and the salad cost me $6.50.That's right folks, dinner for $6.50!The place itself is pretty charming. They have a trolley car in the middle you can sit in. The one drawback is that this place is very "family" oriented; something Miss G and I are not normally very "fond" of. But we dealt. Very solid 4 stars....The Old Spaghetti Factory is a fun chain restaurant where both families and larger, alcohol-fueled gatherings are at home.  I come from an area where "red Italian" menu items are commonplace, and mediocrity is the norm.  From this perspective, the cooking here is comforting and old-school; a notch above the ordinary, but nothing to get excited about.  Fortunately, portions are very generous, prices are quite reasonable and The Old Spaghetti Factory scores on that basis.  The lasagna was loaded with meat and just enough ricotta to balance.  Not enough mozzarella was buried under a thick coat of ho-hum tomato sauce.  Several other cheeses were (literally) throw-in's, the dish would improve with their removal or replacement with adequate quantities of garlic, basil, oregeno and/or onion.  Seasoning, in general, appears to be oriented toward their pre-school and geriatric patrons.  My coworker had the crab raviolli; it looked delicious, but a bit light on crab.  She did enjoy it.  While David was a capable and friendly waiter, the kitchen let him (and us) down.  Our appetizers and entrees were brought to the table within a minute of each other; completely unacceptable, and cause for the loss of one star.This place is a Phoenix original! Although  it used to be called The Spaghetti Company, things change. But, it is basically the same.Because, the owner got divorced he lost this location to his wife, who had it join the Chain of Spaghetti Factory.At first with all the changes, it suffered and was not as good as the Company was. But, they have ironed it out a bit and now it is better.The food is good. Not authentic Italian, but for the price it is a fantastic deal.Nothing to complain about at all.  You get a lot of food for a very low price.It is decorated really great. Very old fashioned Victorian style.Servers are friendly and do the best they can, because this place is always packed full.You get soup or salad, bread and butter, a meal , and dessert. All for less than $10.00.The menu has a lot to choose from as well.It is a great place to take children, because the whole family can go out and it does not break the bank. Bathrooms are clean, and lots of parking, additional in the back.Wonderfully charming place filled with attention to detail and comfort food!It is perfect for large & small groups. The food is very reasonably priced and the environment is appropriate for adults and children alike. I love the wooden floors, the cable car that sits in the center (it's a treat to be seated inside!), the separation of dinning areas into different rooms that provide large groups a measure of privacy & the small tables for 2 that all have plush and unique chairs.This location is on Central, directly across from the light rail. Unlike most restaurants in the area, it has a very large parking lot. Not having to worry about parking makes meals here that much more enjoyable :)

Tonight, I cheated on Eliana's with Guanaquito. I still feel a bit guilty, as I've been with Eliana's for years, but when Guanaquito does it better in almost every way, how can you fault me? If you blink, you'll miss it- on McDowell, between the Gourmet House of Hong Kong and Arizona Endoscopy Services. You need to park in back, accessible from a driveway before you pass by the dully colored sign for Guanaquito.Like Eliana's, it's Salvadoran cuisine, but there are so many more options at Guanaquito. They serve breakfast, lunch, and dinner, and based on tonight's sampling, Hubby and I will be back often to work our way through the menu. I had the ensalada drink and Hubby had the Horchata, which the waitress patiently explained was different from Mexican Horchata. It sure was- maybe it was the morrow seed that made it so unique. For his entree, Hubby had the equivalent of the sampler platter- a tamale (again, quite different from a Mexican tamale- softer and creamier), 2 pastales (meat pies) and 2 pupusas (stuffed, grilled tortillas). Guanaquito had a far greater variety of pupusas than Elaina's, and they were every bit as good. The one that I had that was most unique was made with cheese and loroco plant (which to me had an asparagus-y taste). Definitely delicious. At both Salvadoran places, we were served a bowl of cabbage salad, but at Eliana's we had never been told how to eat it. Guanaquito's was far less astringent and we were instructed to eat it with our pupusas. I was skeptical at first, but became quickly hooked. It did not overwhelm the taste of the pupusas, and added a nice crunch and zing. The only thing I found that Eliana's did better than Guanaquito was the flan. Guanaquito's texture was off, but the flavor was acceptable.I suppose I'm willing to share my new love with all of you- but be forewarned- she's a saucy mistress you'll be compelled to visit again and again. Oh- and she's cheap, too. Hubby and I got out of there for $24 (and that includes the extras I got to round out my leftovers for lunch tomorrow!).I popped in quickly to see if they took debit the girl behind the counter looked at me blankly and then at her father at least I am assuming thats what he was. He answered for her that they do so I told them I would return. I was early in meeting Amanda B. and Kevin H. so I parked myself at a table. I speak Spanish, does it say that some where on my forehead??? People seem to just "KNOW" this for some reason. Even when I responded in English they continued to speak Spanish to me here. I finally gave in and went with it, the girl said "Ah so you do speak Spanish" like it was some sort of test. She was very polite she did not speak English though and I basically translated for everyone throughout the meal. I have not had El Salvadoran in a really long time so I don't really have anything to compare. I deducted a star because everything had pork bits in it except the salsa and tortillas. I would go again if I was in the area, next time I will clarify no meat when I order.Bean & Cheese Pupusa - awesome very good minus the porkChile Relleno - very good, totally different than Mex. on the inside it was stuffed full of pork, potato and carrots among other stuff it reminded me of a stew minus the liquid.Horchata - Fresh from scratch very very delicious and sweet sugar high achievedI would like to try the soups they looked good and a little pricey.Thanks to Kevin for getting the tip you and Amanda are wonderful company!The pupusas, yes, the pupusas are great. The loroco with cheese has become our favorite, But this past week, I strayed from our standard and tried the gallina soup with braised chicken and salad. All I can say is, "What the hell? Where has this been my whole life?" The soup is magical. Huge chunks of carrot, potato, and zucchini, with some thin noodles, and a savory broth with some mint leaves. I quickly abandoned the rest of my entree in favor of finishing the huge bowl of magic. It was the best soup I've had since coming to Phoenix 13 years ago. Good thing Hubby got sick this weekend- it gave me an excuse to go back and get some more. Being magical, you know it has serious healing properties. Here's where I learned that the Sopa de Gallina is chicken soup without the chicken meat and the Sopa de Pollo is the same thing but with the meat. Two huge Styrofoam cups to go with lemon wedges and 4 hot and fresh tortillas cost less than $6.00. I was stunned. The owner said it costs more with meat. Believe me, you won't miss it. Who knew that magic was so cheap? Hubby's fever is already down and he's feeling much better.Guanaquito was the place picked for April's International Supper Club UYE, and this is truly a place you can't judge by its outsides.  From the outside, it looks pretty sketchy but one you walk in your put at ease.I knew before I got there that all I wanted was beans, rice and flour tortillas, its simple and it was what I was craving.  So after checking out the menu I went with Orden de Pupusas, it was 3 pupusas, beans, rice and a cabbage slaw of sorts.  If you are unsure of what pupusas are, they are like a smaller thicker flour tortilla and are stuffed in the middle. The 3 I ordered were stuffed with beans and cheese, this was the perfect meal for me, just what I was craving. The surprising part of the meal though was the rice, this was some really good rice, I am not really a rice person, but this rice was just perfect. The cabbage slaw, which isn't even the correct way of describing it, was the perfect topping for the pupusas. Now I am looking forward to going back and trying out other items on the menu, everyone's dish looked great!

Once upon a time in a city FAR FAR AWAY (from HOME = Chicago) a Beautiful young woman and her handsome husband were toying around on Groupon while house hunting  (The Queen City = Charlotte) and low and behold a deal for this place by the name of Cajun Queen.Considering that we met in New Orleans, LA and my great grandmother is from the French Quarters and cooked Cajun food regularly, we have a distinctive taste bud for AMAZING to Moderate Authentic Cajun Food.When you approach you would not expect the crowd that this place draws, I ALWAYS make a reservation on Open Table before going ALWAYS. It's a HUGE house that was transitioned into a restaurant and a HUGE house it is in order to fit that many people at tables inside for brunch, lunch and dinner. It's not that large but considering that it was a HOME it's HUGE.The day we decided on land to build our home on we decided to go celebrate and have dinner using our Groupon. THIS WAS ONE OF THE BEST GROUPON DEALS WE EVER OBTAINED mainly due to the Southern feel, the TASTE, the SERVICE, etc...I am not a FIVE star type of woman by far, I have to be pretty impressed and Cajun Queen has been VERY consistent. We've been more than 20 times now and I am just writing my review because I had to wait to ensure that there was consistency with the service, taste and feel of this place.Cajun Queen is our GO-TO restaurant when we have family or friends visit. We like to take them somewhere that they can't go when they are back in their perspective cities that is also AMAZING and leave a memory in their mouth and mind. We've had everything from craw-fish appetizer, fried green tomatoes, Fried Oysters, etc.. to Entrees including the Blacken Salmon topped with craw-fish and artichoke & sun dried tomato, Shrimp & Craw-fish Diane, Chicken Diane, Gumbo, Seafood Etouffee', New Orleans Platter (Fried Everything) etc..All items mentioned are AWESOME, there are ALWAYS deals on Groupon however we go with or without a Groupon because it's WELL WORTH IT.. Be sure to make a reservation and if you don't be prepared to wait, however the bar area is small upstairs but a good time to say the least.Happy Eating

I can completely thank Yelp App for this great find, I was way too early to head into work and wanted some breakfast and not from a fast food chain, so I looked what was in the area and found the Nosh Cafe so off I went.When I got there it had a little line, but don't worry, it moves sort of fast, while waiting in line I checked out the menu board and saw they had a lot going on, that I want to try it all, but I had to limit my choice to just one this time around.Now they have breakfasts off the grill and breakfast sandwiches, so I knew the sandwiched sounded good, so I checked out the selection and went with the Ranchero on a jalapeno bagel and a large caramel latte. The Ranchero was egg, sausage, red onion & house made southwest cream cheese; it was a great breakfast bagel sandwich.Happy to had found Nosh Cafe, and saw they do lunch and its less than 2 miles from my work, so I can pretty much say I will be back again soon.

A great little place. I love their produce, fruits, meats and spices. They carry alot of very hard to find skin care products that I love. They were even the first place in Pittsburgh that carried Carol's Daughter products. They also carry pre made salads, sandwiches and wraps. Sure it's not as big as I would like but it's still a great place. If you like Whole Foods and Trader Joe's you will like this place as well.

This place had the most AMAZING meatloaf, fried chicken, and mac & cheese. I also ordered a side of greens which were good but a little too salty for me. I don't order meatloaf at restaurants mainly because I know it'll probably be dry or have no flavor, but I had this feeling that Bobby C's would make it perfectly. I wasn't disappointed. It had this slight crunchiness on the outside that was like little heavenly crunchy bits. The fried chicken beat the pants off of any other soul food restaurant I've been to. It was so juicy and to die for. The mac and cheese was another hit. Next time I'm going to order the mashed potatoes and gravy as well! The staff was really friendly and the atmosphere was loungy with great old school tunes being played on their nice sound system.

Ugh. I realize now that any place with the words club, factory or n things in their name I'm gonna give 2 stars or less. Or the word rainforest. But that's a different story. I dared to try something exotic. Salt and pepper shrimp. Hey, I'm Scandanavian. Pepper is an exotic spice to my people. But, I'm sorry, pepper must have been 86d that day. It was more like Salt shrimp. Or Soggy ass salt shrimp. Not good. We had the obligatory chain restaurant appetizer combo. No Awesome Blossom here folks. But overall this beat the entrees. Chased down with a lychee nut cocktail I was ready to quit this club. Service was amiable, but we were stuck in a corner, blocked in by a large party, with, ugh, children. Or as I so affectionately called them, Children of the Corn. Not much joy in this club. Or luck with entree selection. So I say no. No to the Joyless Luckless Bamboo Club.

Great place for Mexican Baked Goods (Pan Dulce). They have cochitos, churros, zinger rolls, Mexican wedding cookies, empanadas, and several other festive pastries.  I like to drop in on my way to the office when I'm feeling nice and want to treat my co-workers to a little culture. Unlike bagels and store bought doughnuts, these treats are always gone by mid morning and that's how I like it.  Also good for a hearty breakfast burrito.  Try the Chorizo, Potato, Bean and Egg 4-way. Que Bueno!  I can't vouch for any of the lunch/dinner combo meals but will return for the baked goods and burritos.A good place to have some really good burritos. Place is neat and has a good atmosphere. Price is decent enough. Not much to expect here though.

I am not impressed with this place.  My friend and I walk into the bar side for tapas.  I had read the reviews on yelp before I went, but my friend really wanted to check this place out.  My first impression:  There are at least 7 empty tables and a totally empty bar.  The hostess asks us how many, and are we here for drinks, tapas, or full meal?  I tell her tapas, and she tells us it's going to be 5-10 minutes, would we like to have a drink at the bar?  Sure, we walk past several empty tables and sit at the empty bar.  We are impressed with the blue light coming out from the bar top, when a "bartender" walks past and LITERALLY THROWS a drink menu onto the bar near us.  And keeps walking by.  I wasn't shocked because I had read the reviews, but I thought that was totally rude.I asked another guy walking by for a glass of water.  He was able to ablige, and by the time we got our water, amazingly the empty table behind us was available.  We sat, checked out a menu, ordered 3 tapas, and my friend ordered a beer and I ordered a glass of wine.  It took quite awhile for just the drinks to get delivered.  I was disappointed in the amount that they called a "glass" was about half of a glass I've gotten at other restaurants.  And when I was looking at the wine list, I asked for a recommendation, and said I didn't like fruity reds, I preferred more on the dry side.  I took a sip of an incredibly fruity red wine.  Sigh...When the food arrived, it was alright.  Maybe I just expect more.  It was okay food, just not as tasty as I've had elsewhere.  There were no outstanding flavors, or a bite of food that made me sit back and go "wow."  Just ...average.The waitress asked if we wanted to see the dessert menu.  Sure, why not.  We went with the dark chocolate cake.  About 20 minutes later, we finally got the cake.  What took so long?  Who knows.  Maybe they had to bake the cake after we ordered it...  Anyway, I have NEVER left a piece of chocolate cake on a plate at a restaurant before.  My friend said the cake tasted like deli meat to her.  How does one make cake taste like deli meat?  I have no idea.  It tasted out right burnt to me.  Burnt cake peeled out of a pan, with some hersey's syrup on top to cover the taste.I ask for the check.  She came by with the check, I gave her my credit card, and away she went.  Another 15 minutes passed, and she had walked by our table about 5 times.  The next time she walked by, I asked her for the credit card receipt.  She was totally suprised, and hadn't realized she had never given it back to us.  She was sincere, it was just annoying.  I wasn't impressed with the food, and somewhat unhappy with the service.  There was dancing (salsa or something) starting as we were leaving, but I wasn't in the mood for it.  I don't know if I would recommend this place.  Maybe once just to go...  but I think once is enough.

Just when I was about to give up on good sushi in Charlotte my neighbor introduced me to FUJO or what he calls his secret Chinese restaurant. Fujo is tucked away in the Wachovia building downtown. The menu is huge you can try anything from one of their more exotic sushi rolls like the Cajun Roll - (Shrimp & Crawfish Inside: Topped w/ Spicy Crab and Cajun Spice) to authentic and tasty Chinese dishes like chicken with garlic sauce. The hardest part is choosing what to eat. Did I mention that they serve my favorite wine here I haven't seen it in any other restaurant around yet...Sophia Coppola's sparkling white wine it's served in a little pink can. That just makes the experience that much better. You never have to wait for a table and its a great place for a group dinner before heading out for some drinks uptown.

When I only ordered sandwiches I was doing it all wrong. The way to go is to get a half chicken and the 1/3 slab combo with brisket. Insane amount of food? Yes. Worth getting to try all the best parts of the menu? Yes!After surviving my first tornado scare in Madison, Wisconsin, my partner in crime, Daniel L. and I ventured out to this well known local BBQ hangout for some good old smoky ribs and all the fixings.With the Midwest reputation of having some of the finest meats, it was a no brainer to order the 1/3 slab BBQ smoked ribs and pork shoulder sandwich combination dinner ($14.75). The staff mentioned the pork shoulder and the beef brisket were the top sellers besides the ribs.The pork shoulder was pigilicious! The shredded meat was perfectly seasoned with the rub and then hickory smoked which gave its own taste without the addition of the BBQ sauce. It also impressed me because there were was no sign of grease on the pork. The bun was a standard bread bun compared to the sweet roll which accompanied the dinner combination. We took the recommendation of the staff and ordered the extra meat (additional 5 ounces for $3) since were feeling extra carnivorous! The BBQ pork ribs came with five succulent ribs with the meat just waiting to fall off the bone. Each bite had a generous coating of their famous award winning BBQ sauce. Our dinner combination came with two choices of side orders which we picked the baked beans and cole slaw. Both were served in a small styrofoam cups along with the BBQ sauce. It's easy to see why the BBQ sauce won numerous award because of it's rich, sweet and peppery flavor. I'm not a fan of cole slaw but this one exceed my expectations with its creaminess and was extra cold. The baked beans maintained a firm texture and should be ordered with any meal because the sauce was so addictive.The cabin style interior holds 11 tables and is very close to the Madison airport. The actual BBQ pit is located a few miles away from the restaurant. So grab your dental floss and wet naps and eat some authentic BBQ at Smoky Jon's!EDIT - REPLY TO SMOKY JON - ORIGINAL REVIEW BELOWHi Jon,This is the same canned reply you leave for all of your negative reviews (yep, read them all), and it shows the same cavalier attitude as your bbq.... In reading through all of the reviews, the one thing noticed is that the vast majority of positive reviews are unable to compare to bbq eaten in the known meccas of this country, while the negative reviews have many comparisons to KC, Texas, S Carolina, etc, etc.....  you know, the people that have been around and actually do KNOW what it is they are APPRECIATING.Knowing that you HAVE won numerous awards in these very places, you would think that you wouldn't fall back on the review rating of those that don't know any better. No slam, I didn't know bbq from bratwurst until I started traveling either, but maybe it would be best to show WI what good bbq is, and not high-five yourself for being better than burgers and brats off the old Weber.... as my review stated, your place does have the potential to do that.So, while respecting your opinion as well, I still must disagree with you, and have offered all of the actual reasons for doing so. In the end, it's your business, run it how you will - just don't point at awards for sauces you don't offer, years of experience when it's not you at the pit, and a canned reply to those of us that know bbq stating we must not know how to appreciate it..... Also - my original review had everything in it regarding how to raise your food up to my, and many others, standards. Fix those issues, and I'll give it another shot. Best Regards,CalebHi Caleb,Thanks for your feedback, I respect your opinion but I must disagree with you. As you can see on the other reviews and by the awards we have won, our BBQ has great quality and taste. Also, we've been on the market for over 25 years, which makes us a great BBQ tradition for those who know how to appreciate it. Please contact me next time you visit us and we'll make sure our food is up to your standards.Best,Jon Olson ORIGINAL REVIEWI'm not sure why this place has 4 stars - was some of the worst bbq (with potential, will explain after I complain) that I've had. I also get that this IS Wisconsin, and bbq has a whole different meaning than in the bbq meccas around the nation, but damn....Ordered 1/2 rack w 1/2 chicken, 1/3 rack w pork shoulder sandwich, and 1/3 rack w brisket sandwich. Sides of baked beans, mashed potatoes, and mac-n-cheese. So, pretty good variety of what they offer. The bad:- membrane not removed from ribs - trying to eat meat stuck to a huge piece of essentially dried and smoked skin as the bones are pulled apart is pretty gross. Any pitmaster or fan of bbq knows this needs to be removed prior to smoking, any other explanation boils down to plain laziness. Fully half of the meat was stuck to the membrane as it fell off the bones. And a star is lost!- chicken was smoked beyond merely dry - think chicken jerkey. And a star is lost!- both sandwiches were minced meat to the point of being indistinguishable from one another in both taste and appearance. Where are the slices of brisket and juicy chunks/shreds of pork? Not here. And a star is lost!- only one bbq sauce is offered standard, the only other flavor (same sauce, only spicier) has to be ordered separately and at extra cost. Sides were very small (about 2oz) and nothing extraordinary - mac-n-cheese was somehow "flour-ey" with overcooked noodles. Can't imagine what end piece of corn with 5 kernels I would have received had I ordered that. And a star is lost!The "potential":The taste of the ribs was not bad, the chicken as well. I think if the "pitmaster" was given a raise and some training, or given the boot and replaced with someone qualified to run the pit, the food could be brought to par. I also think it's not to much to ask for a wider variety of sauces - where are the sauces that all of the newspaper clippings on the walls referencing Smoky Jon's contest awards at? Quit being cheap with the sides. I like taters, more than 5 bites please!! Hook up the mac with some cheese!! I support small businesses and love bbq, give me a reason to!!The "good":Staff is friendly. Most of the food had good flavor, but fell way short on the prep/handling end. Place was very clean and smelled delicious.

Review Text :
I was in town and my friend wanted to take me to the place across the street from Postino but they weren't opened for lunch.  Fine with me because Postino turned out great!  The valet boy and one of the other men waiting for a table gave us good reviews so we said, why not?It's been a long while since my friend and I saw each other so we were talking a lot in-between trying to figure out what to order.  The waitress had to come back 3 times before we settled on something, but she was cool with it.  Known for their bruschetta and sandwiches, that's exactly what we ordered.  The bruschetta came with 4 different options so we chose Mozzarella with Tomato and Basil (good), Chopped Tomato with Pesto (very fresh and tasty), Salami with Pesto (slightly salty but very good), and the Prosciutto with Figs and Mascarpone (my favorite).Thinking we weren't going to be full on just some bread, we also ordered the ham & cheese panini (nicely toasted and yummy).  It comes with a salad and the waitress split this w/o us mentioning it.  We ended up only eating half the sandwich and half the bruschetta.  The bruschetta were big (about the size of your palm -- not mine, because I have small hands) and thick as well.  The toppings were generous and all very fresh.I'd definitely come back next time I'm in town.Postino Winecafe is a longtime favorite of mine... Not sure why it took me so long to write my own review, maybe because the 67 that came before mine do a pretty good job of describing it.  However, I woke up today and felt like giving my two cents - so here goes:Whether you go to Postino for a business lunch, an afternoon glass of wine, a happy hour, dinner, or even after dinner drink - you can't go wrong!  Postino is great for any occasion!  (Although maybe not a big group based on what I read in previous reviews).  I've been for pretty much all of the occasions listed above, and every visit to Postino, I leave a satisfied customer.  My favorite lunchtime menu items are the brushcetta (perfect for sharing as an appetizer and fun to choose from the variety of delicious selections), the Mixed Greens Salad (which comes with shaved pears, candied pecans, red grapes, gorgonzola, and crispy leeks served with poppyseed vinaigrette - and I usually add turkey to it too), and the Raspberry Chicken Salad.  LOL at my long description, but had to include it all!I'm not usually a daytime drinker but I'm all for starting happy hour early and taking advantage of 'wine by the glass' $4 special - great wine list! The ambiance and service is fantastic and it's fun to people watch at Postino as well.  It's a fantastic little neighborhood place, and there are several little details that make Postino stand out in my eyes... next time you're there, check out the sugar / sweet'n low dish thing on the table - there's a little something special there if you need to spit out your gum before digging into your meal :)  Also check out the branded rolls of TP in the bathroom - so cute!Can't wait to go on a Monday night sometime soon to take advantage of their special: $9 off a bottle of wine and pizza from LGO!  Postino has a regular loyal customer in me and I don't see that changing anytime soon!This is one of my favorite wine bars I have been to.  The wine list is great and the food is just as good!It has an upscale feel and makes you think you are in NYC (but without the homeless people peeing on the building); they have a great vib going on and you will LOVE it!Oh yes, and you know what... it used to be a Post Office, SWEETI've been to Postino a few times, but as we all know it is a violation of Yelp TOS to review an establishment until you've been drunk there. What? It's not? Well, I would consider it in poor taste.I got drunk at Postino last night and had a wonderful time. The $20 Bruschetta Board and Bottle of Wine promotion they have Mondays and Tuesdays is a ridiculous steal. I didn't want to be the alcey to ask if that deal was limited to one-per-table as I was fully planning on consuming my own bottle of wine and possibly my own board of bruschetta. Luckily the guys across the bar had the same plan, so I didn't have to. FYI: It is illegal for restaurants to serve you your own bottle of wine. Don't ask how I know. I just know. However, you can split 3 or 4 with one other person and nobody says anything. Don't ask how I know this either. I just know. All of the different bruschetta options are fantastic. The Prosciutto one tasted like Cinnamon Toast to me. That may have been the booze talking. Considering I kept referring to it as "Cinnamon Toast Crunch", I'm going to go ahead and say it was. The roasted red pepper & goat cheese and the apple & brie were equally delicious. Sorry, I don't have a breakfast cereal comparison for them. To top it off, the service is fan-freaking-tastic. Everyone is extremely helpful and seems genuinely HAPPY  that you are there spending money. Clearly, from a business standpoint, this should be a given, but more often than not it isn't. Once I was there with a girl whose recently adopted Greyhound was somehow prompted to dart across the patio like a bat out of hell, knocking over chairs and wine glasses along the way. Not only was the staff RIDICULOUSLY nice about it, a few of the valet guys actually CHASED AFTER this greyhound and I'm pretty sure one of them got into his car to find it. The staff literally organized an impromptu search party for a dog that could run upwards of 60 MPH. That is some damn good service. And, we found the dog.Last night I made my second trip to Postino and was in the company of a very lovely young woman. Lucky me :) I had been to this location one other time, but I wasn't there very long and I forgot what I ate. SO, i was really looking forward to this trip. Plus, Amber W was kind enough to give me a gift card for Christmas. Thanks Amber! The parking here is sort of on the ridiculous side because the lot is so small. You have to valet your vehicle. I think it was $3. It was busy when we arrived and were quoted about 25 minutes. So we went over to the waiting area to start with some wine. We didn't even have a chance to order because our table was ready already. We were seated outside and I feared for my date's life because it was a little chilly and I don't think the dress she was wearing was really made for winter nights. Thankfully there was a heater planted right behind her. Our server took our drink orders promptly. I had the Tierra de Luna Malbec. Very good. She had a Reisling, which was very sweet and fruity. Started with the bruschetta and holy schnikes! I could have eaten this all night. We opted for the Smoked Salmon with capers and Pesto, the Tomato, Basil, & Mozzarella, the Ricotta with pistachios and dates, and the Brie with apples and fig spread. All of them were amazing! I am not a salmon fan, but this smoked salmon was delicious! It was also my first attempt at Brie. This too was good. For the meal, my lady friend or special lady, (Big Lebowski random quote) had the Raspberry Chicken salad. It was chunky chicken salad on a bed of greens with a raspberry vinaigrette. I was told it was good. I went for the half panini and soup combo. I had the Vegetarian with the Tomato and Gorgonzola soup. Originally the wrong panini came out. The server got it replaced and put the wrong one in a to go box to take home. Thought that was nice for the mix up. The soup was excellent. It is a very close second to The Roosevelt's tomato soup. The Vegetarian panini was good, but could have used a little more veggies on it. Unfortunately there was no room for dessert, but they all sounded amazing. Overall, a great experience with great food and drink. Service was great and the atmosphere was perfect. Again, thanks Amber W for the gift!!!Time to share some opinions here that the majority might not agree with...Sandra Bullock is a horrible actressHigh School was NOT the best time of my lifePostino Winecafe does not live up to the hype...while I write this, I of course realize that most people sadly somehow enjoy Sandra Bullock films, think High School was a blast, and...at least according to the reviews on Yelp, adore Postino Winecafe. The food is decent enough...bruschetta was flavorful (although on our last visit the bread was a little hard) and the Pub Board appetizer is amazing. The main gripe we have with this place is the service. Do you have to spend a lot of money on alcohol or look like a hipster here to get good service or what? We went for a light meal...nothing more. I don't see a sign on the door that says 'must buy wine', so why did our waiter treat us like a couple of vagrants while he was overly friendly to tables around us who were spending more money? I get it...higher bill, higher tip...this is no excuse for bad service though. A paying customer is a paying customer. The disparity in service couldn't have been more painfully obvious, and that's a shame. Maybe we went on an off night...or maybe Postino is getting cocky...who knows?We had a decent meal, but left feeling like outsiders instead of valued guests. Maybe next time if I wear a 'deep V-neck' and Katrina wears some 'jeggings', we'll appear wealthier and get better service. Eh.3.25/5.It's way too loud in here. I prefer the Central Ave. location.You know when a movie comes out and EVERYONE is talking about how great it is and when you finally see it you are extremely disappointed and wonder what all the fuss was about? That is what I half expected about Postinos.  Instead, this place EXCEEDED the already high expectations others had set in place for it. I came here on a Friday evening a couple of weeks ago after a wine tasting at LGO. It was 6:30-7:00pm and we only waited a couple of minutes for a table. It was just me and a girlfriend and since we have the same taste in wine, we decided to order a bottle to share.  We had the RIckshaw Pinot Noir which was delightful.  For food we had the Cheeseboard and the mozzarella and tomato jr.  AMAZING.  I love cheese (as do most wine lovers) and their cheeseboard was delicious.  It features a great variety of cheeses from mild to strong in flavor.  In my eyes the best combo of foods and flavors is the ever simplistic tomatoes, mozzarella, and basil.  Postinos does it perfecto. Everything is fresh as fresh as can be, my mouth is watering just thinking about it!I had major food envy when I saw the table next to us get served an impressive plate of Bruschetta.  I will definitely be trying that the next time I come. Here is how much I loved this place: I just found out my schedule is changing and I'll be getting off work at 3 instead of 5.  Literally the first thought that popped in my head was "I can make it to Postino's for their amazing happy hour!" I literally can not wait to go back to this place.I have 231 reviews so far and none for one of my all time favorite AZ restaurants? I have to rectify that now. If you love wine and bruschetta than this will be your own version of Heaven. Blasphemy? Then you've never been to Postino! Seriously, they have the best bruschetta you're likely to ever have in your entire life. My top four: 1) Prosciutto with Figs & Mascarpone2) Brie & Apples with Fig Spread3) Roasted Peppers with Goat Cheese4) Burrata, Bacon, Arugula & TomatoesAlso worthy of mention are the amazing sandwiches. I highly recommend the Autostrada (Sopresatta, Italian ham, cappicola, mortadella, provolone, arugula and tomatoes with spicy pepper relish) and the Nine Iron (Hickory smoked bacon layered with grilled chicken, fresh burrata mozzarella, lettuce, beefsteak tomato and dijonnaise). Fucking awesome.As you'll read in most of the other reviews, Postino has a great Monday and Tuesday night special, a bottle of wine and a bruschetta board for only $20. But be warned, it'll be jam packed. Keep in mind they have two other locations as well. For you east valley residents there is a new Gilbert loction. If you are in downtown Phoenix or west valley, then the Central Avenue location a couple blocks north of Camelback will be more convenient.With its outstanding food, decor, and ambiance, I'm going to give you a Paul V. guarantee that you will love Postino.Always my 'go to' wine bar to hang with my girls.. :-) AND I am in love with the Sangria Sundays there.. We go early to secure our choice table.. under a mister.. in the patio section of where WE want to be.. looking swag! Gettin our Sangria on.. and our bruschetta.. We know the whole thing by heart.. NOW the last time we were there.. We did send a salad back.. NO question from the cutie serving it. He took it.. and said he was sorry.. brought a little extra bruschetta.. and BAM. NOW looka there.. I kept the 5star on the yelp! Actually, it would be hard for Postino to lose that with me, because I have been coming here since I moved to the PHX and no other wine bar compares. I heart all things Postino.. MY only wish.. Sangrias all week!I'm on a huge Postino kick lately and had another awesome dinner there last night with five girlfriends.  Since my last review of this place was in 2008, I figured it was time for an update, but honestly, not too much has changed since then - I'm a very loyal customer and have been for years!My favorite menu items are still the same too:The artichoke dip (which actually comes with hummus too but I always special request double artichoke instead because I love it so much), the mixed green salad with added turkey, chicken, or prosciutto, and the bruschetta board... My top two bruschetta faves are Brie & Apple with Fig Spread and Prosciutto, Fig & Mascarpone. Mmmmm!I'm not currently drinking (I'm prego again), but of course this is the perfect place to go for a glass of wine or four as well!  Service is always fabulous and the atmosphere rocks too.  So in my eyes, this place deserves five stars... even almost five years from my original review!Of course, it is worth noting that it's not only a favorite of mine, there are plenty of others that love it too... so, sometimes you may have to wait a bit.  If you've got a large party (eight or more), I highly recommend making a reservation ahead of time.I'm such a fan of my Postino! I am addicted to the bruschetta! I start craving it after a few weeks of not having it! In fact, I will go bread free and NOT have any bread .. SO I can load up on bruschetta when I come here. This place is packed.. No matter when you come here. I want to say get here 'early' , but truly.. there is no 'early' at Postino. Just get here! Get your name on the list and get your belly near the bar and get your drinks ordered. I usually never change things up too much. I love red wines and that is what I go with .. always. I like the $5 wines until 5pm. After that, if this is where my group is hanging , we generally go with the bottle then. The bottles are priced at 3x the amount of the glass price. Not bad and not hard to figure out. The meat board is great .. the cheese board is divine. All bruschettas ...mmmmmm. I've never done any desserts here. Maybe I should . But I usually am not a dessert girl. So I use my calories on wine, bread and cheese! I only brought my star down one as the last time I was here our waiter was to split the bill with me and my flight attendant friend from NYC. Instead, not only did he split it, he split and added the full cost to my card too! It took about 5 business days to correct! I'm still a fan, though.Catering: I catered a small gathering at my place with bruschettas and paninis . Perfect and on time. You pay as you order.Postino has 3 locations around the Valley!  I've been to 2 of them now and the one thing you can say about Postino, they are an amazing place to dine/drink and they are very consistent with service, quality and ambiance.  We typically go the Postino on Central, however we dined here a couple of weeks ago with some friends and found them to be fantastic! I really like the patio area!! It was too cold for us on this trip however this is a "must come back" kinda of place just to enjoy a great meal on their patio!!Food~ if your dining for lunch go straight to the salads and/or bruschettas!!  Their portions are actually larger than you think and after you pick and choose some of the different ones to eat, you'll thank me for passing on the apps!!  However if you re dinning for dinner or have a larger group or a huge appetite, then go ahead and order some apps.  I suggest trying their Bella Postino~ warm artichoke dip and white bean hummus with assorted breads or their Butcher's Block~ with different artisan meats and cheeses served with Tuscan beans, olives, nuts and crostini.  Both are DELISH!  Bruschetta's~ here are some of our faves;  Prosciutto with Figs & Mascarpone, the Smoked Salmon with Pesto is my go to!! The Burrata, Bacon, Arugula & Tomato is also a go to!  We also like to try their seasonal burchettas as well!  Paninis~ go for the prosciutto with brie or their Nine Iron with smoked bacon layered with grilled chicken, fresh burrata mozzarella, lettuce, beefsteak tomato and special sauce = nom.nom.nom!! Service~  our service was a little slower than what we are used to at their Central location however our server was very friendly, knew the menu well and tried her best to keep up.All in all it was a FANTASTIC experience!! My friends and I are looking forward to coming back on a Monday or Tuesday when they have their $20 special, a bottle of wine and burchetta ~ put me down for 2 please! I hope to see you there.Two words:Prosciutto With Brie on Focaccia Bread.  Okay, that was a lot more than 2 words, but I don't care.  It was downright amazing; like my tastebuds were being dry humped by the best sandwich ever invented in the History of the World (Part II).On a Monday/Tuesday night, if you time it right, Postino's is a neighborhood staple in Arcadia. The $20 for a bottle and board of bruschetta is a *steal*. As one of employee said, "How could you not order this?" while we waited for our table.  My friend and I arrived early to request a table for four. Perched on a tall side table we enjoyed a full view of the restaurant. Sipping not so daintily we quickly passed the 45 minute wait.  Once seated Bethany was a wonder. Our bill was seamlessly transferred and waters arrived. The neat thing about traveling in a pack of four is that, Yes, You Can drink three bottles of wine. What could possibly be better than that? It removes the need to think hard about the bruschetta menu. (There are 12 options so we had one of each brought out.)We surprised the fella in the group. He doubted that three bruschetta boards would be sufficient to feed his hungry belly. If you haven't been before, a bruschetta is palm sized and sliced into four pieces. Trust me, there's plenty. But if you're still hungry this is a wine bar and they have food. The panini selection is wonderful, I beg to argue the Nine Iron is the best.  (Bacon layered with grilled chicken, burrata mozzarella, lettuce, beefsteak tomato and dijonnaise!) Another approach, perhaps on another visit, is to order the Butchers Block (big assortment of meat and cheese) for $14 and/or the Cheese Board for $13.If for some reason wine is not up your alley, Postino's offers pitchers of beer. If you need to drink a cocktail...suck it up kid. That's not happening here. The Mon/Tue special begins at 8pm. I'd recommend scoring a table before the start time, even if that means buying some appetizers beforehand. Make sure to ask for Bethany! She's the sweetest thing!Came here for my birthday with my wife and some friends. All the photos of the food made me crazy hungry so we could not resist.Place looks like it could have been an old post office in another lifetime. Inside has been redecorated and there is a really nice patio for you outdoors folks. No need to check your mail here. Just order what looks good and they deliver it right to your table.Started with the Butcher's Block Starter plate and an ice cold Italian Beer. It was beautiful and tasty at the same time. Decided to go with the famous Bruschetta next. What did we not try is the question. There are so many choices.Brie & Apple with Fig Spread, Prosciutto with Figs & Mascarpone, Warm Artichoke Spread, the yummy Ricotta with Dates & Pistachios and a few others that were not so great.We all enjoyed anything with Figs on it. The plates were very colorful and the quality of the food was very high and fresh. Sounds like a good portion of their products come from right here in the valley. Nice!Recommend coming here during the day and not at night. The lighting is very dim and we had to use a flashlight app on my phone to see the food and menu. Maybe I'm justing getting too old for the late night thing.Seen other reviews saying that the best areas to sit are on the patio or right between the inside and outdoor seating area. Not sure how that works when it is a crisp 118 degrees outside. I bet the cheese starts melting rather fast.Definitely a fun and enjoyable time. The Bruschetta is out of this world and a new favorite of mine. Looking forward to trying out some of the other locations. SALUTE!4.25 STARSMy husband and I went to Postino for a dinner date during a recent weekend trip to Phoenix. It wasn't quite what we expected--we'd assumed it was the kind of Italian place where you could get a glass of wine and a plate of pasta--but we had a great time.Our reservation was for eight o'clock on a Saturday night, and the place was busy but comfortable. It felt intimate and not too crowded. The lighting was low, and the space was warm and charming. A great go-to date spot. Service was great. Our waitress was friendly and helpful, and we were well taken care of.Postino is more a wine bar than a full sit-down restaurant, with reasonably priced bottles and a menu that consists of large format antipasti and paninis. We ordered a bottle of Canto Sur, a red blend of mostly cabernet and carmenere. You can get wines by the glass here, but the bottle prices are only three times the glass prices, putting most of the bottles in the high twenties/low thirties range. We were happy with the wine. We also ordered a few antipasti and tried to order paninis for our dinner when our waitress stopped us--she said what we thought were antipastis would fill us up plenty, and she was absolutely right.Granted, we were planning to order a pretty big spread of appetizers. We shared the butcher's block, the pub board, and a selection of four bruschetta. Did not realize that each of these boards would be gigantic. Everything was delicious. The butcher's block came with plenty of meat--prosciutto, coppa, salami, and peppered salami--along with goat cheese and white bean hummus. There was crostini, of course, and a huge assortment of great accompaniments--olives, dried cranberries, almonds, asparagus, cherry tomatoes, smoked yellow tomatoes, and three kinds of pickle.The pub board brought another huge spread, this one of MJ's soft pretzels, Scrheiner's chorizo, cornichons, aged cheddar, and giant Spanish corn nuts. It was fun to mix and match everything on these boards, and it was all fantastic. The bruschetta seems to be the main draw of Postino, but I didn't understand why until our selection arrived. We opted to order four of them for $14, and were expecting bruschetta sized like bruschetta. These were more like full-on flatbreads, with the four bruschetta adding up to about a pizza in volume. We had the tomato jam and fresh sheep's milk cheese, the salami with pesto, the prosciutto with figs and mascarpone, and the burrata, bacon, arugula, and tomato. Not a dud in the bunch--loved all the meat, and the tangy cheese with the sweet tomato jam was perfect on its own.We took great pleasure in our feast of antipasti and wine. We ate with our hands and enjoyed the variety. I'd love to go back to Postino next time I'm in Phoenix. I'd be a regular if I lived in town.

Restaurant name  Sun Up Brewing
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
I am a fan and supporter of local breweries here in the valley. Last night I visited two of them in the city, SunUp was my second stop for the evening. So first impression when I walked in was that this place has got some interesting history to it. There were pictures of past figures and well known people within the community. The bar area has some limited seating so if you wanna head there with some friends, somebody needs to get there early. The rest of the place has plenty of seating for more private conversations. The brews are not too bad and I know I have seen the sunup crew at alot of beer festivals and events, so I do like that they go out there and represent who they are, gotta keep local brews alive! Llast night for me was two pints which were descently priced HOWEVER with my Yelp check-in, I only paid one dollar per pint and even got discounted appetizers! I was shocked but after talking to my bartender, I come to find out the owner is crazy for yelpers! So if you don't minda smaller size bar and a not too bad central location, go down a get a pint or two for a buck!

Dairy Queen? Or Dirty Queen? And I'm not talking about my femmy neighbor with the Member's Only jacket drenched in Patchouli. Really, it's not working. You're just stinky. But this DQ could use a visit from Mr. Clean and the Brawny paper towel guy. Both of whom I've had huge crushes on. Napkins, papers and spoons on the floor. Behind the counter wasn't a pretty picture either. They weren't busy and should have been cleaning. You know what they say..."If there's time to lean, there's time to clean." However, my simple little vanilla cone really hit the spot. For that...2 stars. Staff was friendly. One more. Total. Three stars

Restaurant name  Havana Cafe

Review Text :
Bring on the mojitos!  Or a pitcher of sangria. Both are terrific at Havana.  Even if you aren't interested in alcohol you are in luck. This place is worth it without the booze too.Every time I come here I am so happy. The place is usually bustling and busy, yet I never have to wait. The service is so friendly that I feel valued as a patron and the food is great.  Some of the dishes I recommend: - The salads are out of this world. All of them are a good choice. My fave involves onions, avocados and mangoes- The Cho-Cho is a great vegetarian dish. I'm a flesh eatin', animal killin' meat eater but I still enjoy this menu item- Fish! Every fishy is yummy here. The best are the Sea Bass, Shrimp and the Tilapia - The Pollo Cubana is an excellent basic chicken/rice/bean dish  - The Ropa Vieja was okay. Pretty good but not out of this world- The desserts are excellent. The coconut flan with mango sauce is my new favorite thing ever - They put limes in my diet coke. YES! Nice touch.* One word of caution: They make you valet during the weekend. Not a fan of the unnecessary (but very personable) valet. Boo!** Second word of caution: The bathrooms are outside and around the corner. Be prepared to feel like you are walking down a shady alley if you have to pee. Maybe fear of an alley attack is part of the charm. Just like in Cuba, I guess.First, I'd like to send a shout-out to Irma, our server who has given me hope that there are caring hospitable people in the food industry.  Irma receives 5 stars for taking good care of me and my sweetheart during our recent date at the Havana Cafe. Way to go Irma!We step into a well packed restaurant on a Friday night with plans to try the Sailor's Paella Special and a few cocktails. We wait for just a few seconds until we are greeted by Irma and her warm smile and are led to our table. Our cocktail orders are taken immediately, 1 Mojito and 1 White Sangria. Both exceeded our expectations and were just thing to get our date started.The ambiance is whimsical and charming - Reminded me of the movie "The Bird Cage" without the drag queens and dramatic dialogue. Bummer!Now on to the Paella. It was the perfect dish for the evening offering plenty of shrimp, calamari, crab, scallops, muscles, tuna and a healthy serving of saffron rice. This meal also requires a little handy work to get to the crab and muscles but you are given the proper instruments to do so. This may not be the best choice for those who do not enjoy this kind of food activity but we had a lot of fun with it.  We will be back soon to try another interactive meal and partake of a round or two of Mojitos. So if you are in the mood for something different, fun, and oh so delicioso, I recommend you try a night out at the Havana Cafe. I also hope you have the pleasure of meeting a groovy gal who goes by the name Irma.If you want to go to Havana Cafe, follow my lead:I can't break the delicious habit of starting with a mango rum mojito or sangria depending on my mood. No need to order "dinner." Chose 3 tapas... I'll pick two and you can pick ONE. I pick the papa rellena ($6.50) potato croquettes about the size of a tennis ball (one for each of us) filled with ground beef and topped with a delicious lime cilantro sauce (Yes, I used the words delicious and cilantro in the same sentence! Me! The girl who HATES cilantro!!) and the black bean fritters (frituras de frijoles negres $5.25), little poppers accompanied by a scrumptious calypso avocado dip that is laced with either sour cream or cream cheese or both! The third item is your choice. Finish it off with a Cuban coffee (a sweetened shot of espresso) and possibly, depending on willpower or lack thereof, the Caribbean candy bar - coconut flan topped with a rum fudge sauce and toasted almonds. Truly, this is the best way to enjoy Havana Cafe!We tried Havana Cafe last night for the first time... Without mojitos or sangria, perhaps we didn't get the full experience, so I'll have to return for those and sit inside next time too.  But it was a beautiful night, so our party chose outside instead.  Irma was our server (see Robert M's review).  She was fabulous.  We started with a variety of empanadas and the black bean fritters.  I was not a fan of the 'calypso avocado dip' that comes on the side of the fritters - it reminded me of store bought guacamole that is so creamy, it doesn't even taste like avocado.  The fritters themselves were alright and same with the empanadas.  Next course was chorizo, fish of the day (halibut), and sides of yucca con mojo and asparagus.  I'm a huge yucca fan, so it's always a treat for me when I go to a Cuban restaurant... and it delivered at Havana!  Yum... gotta love that interesting texture!All in all a pleasant experience - I will return with a larger party sometime for the real deal!  Thanks again to Irma for taking good care of us!Craving authentic Cuban cuisine? Well I was, and with one trip to Havana Cafe I satistied my craving. With a small and basic interior, it is far from a glamourized restaurant. However, what Havana Cafe lacks in apperance it makes up for in substance. Quality of the food, authenticity of the dishes and excellent customer service are the factors that really make this place stand out for me. Everything I tasted was extremely rich and packed with flavor. I ordered the ceviche, and it was AWESOME. It left an essence of piquant limes, ripe tomatoes and crisp bell peppers lingering on my tongue. I also thoroughly enjoyed their fried plantain chips with black bean dip (you've got to try it!!!!) This place serves the real Cuban deal.The food here isn't cheap, so plan on spending a good chunk of change on your meal. Also, I'm hoping that I just visited on an off night because the mojito I ordered tasted more like a margarita as it lacked that refreshingly crisp mojito taste. It was disappointing but I'm determined to come back here and give them another chance. That way, I'll have an excuse to check out their mojito specials on Mondays!Our server was awesome and highly attentive. The fact that they have live music is also pretty cool. Overall, this place has a lot of authentic character and that's why I'm a fan. I enjoy unique dining experiences, and Havana Cafe definitely fits that bill. So, if your looking for something different, check this place out! Your taste buds will thank you.Still as good as I remembered! This visit around I tried the following:Alcapurrias (Picadillo stuffed croquette made from tropical vegetable masa)Tostones (Twice-fried green plantains)Arroz con Gandules (Pigeon peas cooked with rice, pork, olives and capers)Mofongo (Crushed plantains and pork cracklings)Sangria made with Red wineCortadito (Café Cubano laced with steamed milk)Between the Tostones & the Calypso chips, I prefer the Calypso chips. The Arroz con Gandules is very good, you can really taste the saltiness of the capers.The Mofongo were my absolute FAVORITES :D  They are very basic, but who needs more?!As far as the Cortadito goes, I'm pretty sure that I could feel my pupils dilating as I was drinking the tiny cup down, lol. If this is a diluted Cuban Coffee, I'm not sure I'm ready for the real deal! Even though it was strong, or perhaps because it was so strong, I feel like I'm hooked! :) Word of warning, if you don't like garlic, you need to really consider your choices. I don't think there are many dishes made without the use of garlic.I've been to Havana café before, but it's been at least 5 years or so. Long enough for me to forget that this place was forgettable, in my own opinion. Take that for what it is, I don't eat much Cuban food.I was unexcited to find that Havana café didn't have any spots available to park, and the rest of the open spots in the parking lot were all labeled specifically for the next door flower shop, coffee shop, and so on. What was I to do? I risked it and parked in a flower shop spot, and well, I wasn't towed, but I still felt like I was doing something wrong by parking there :-/Ultimately, I was lured back with a groupon they had available a few months ago. My first mistake was expecting that I could use my groupon to pay for meals which both totaled above $30 (the value of my groupon) and ALSO ordering additional items from their HH menu. I asked for two of their mojitos and was told that I couldn't order HH since I was using a groupon also. I obliged and let them know that water was just fine. My guess is they realized I wanted to buy my drinks in addition to our meals, and the waitress came back a few minutes later and told us she would put our drink order on a separate check. Nice save on their part - I was a bit miffed at first!My second mistake was not realizing how excessively sweet their mojito was going to be. I saw at the bottom of the glass, what appeared to be a large spoonful of sugar. In this case, it didn't help the medicine go down. After them accommodating me with the drink order and all, I didn't want to make a big to do out of this, so I soldiered my way through my drink.I ordered a shredded beef dish, and my wife a shredded/pulled pork dish. Apparently Cuban's like bell peppers and onions a heck of a lot more than I do. The peppers and onions with my dish accounted for about 3/4th's of the meal. I ate two or three slices of the peppers and a few slices of the onion, but was not satisfied with the small amount of beef the meal came with for a sticker price of $16, and even at $8 since I was paying about half with the groupon.My third mistake was choosing to sub their house vegetables for the beans and rice. I don't eat that many carbs, so often I will exchange potatoes, fries, rice, etc for whatever vegetable is available. The waitress explained that it was a mixture of squash, zucchini, mushrooms, and a few others. In reality, it turned out to be a few slices of squash, a few slices of zucchini, a couple of mushrooms, and guess what, a bucket load of chopped bell peppers and chopped onions. They were also nice enough to charge me extra for the substitution with the meal now totaling $18 before tax and tip.Two $6 mojito's, two $16 meals, an upcharge for the vegetables, and a $5 forgettable appetizer (I don't exactly remember what it was at this point). I was leaving with a $65 meal after tax and tip, hey, I saved $15 on the groupon though.Happy Yelping Phoenix, I hope I made it apparent how unimpressive this spot is. Maybe you prefer pan fried peppers with a bit of beef and a side of... pan fried peppers.Ah, the dreaded worst-experience of my life, horrible service, overcharged BIRTHDAY meal...that ended up in moderate-severe food poisoning.I'm talking the kind of food poisoning where at one point I desecrated the restrooms of a lovely restaurant in downtown Phoenix and ended up laying face down on the sidewalk...to where a homeless man asked me if I was ok.Yeah.  It was that bad.  Food poisoning aside, it was STILL the worst meal of my life, and this WAS my favorite low-key restaurant in the valley.Apparently my birthday fell on the last day of a groupon or livingsocial redemption.  Unlucky us, we paid full price (more than actually...since we were charged for the wrong items they brought out and subsequently took back), and were treated worse somehow than the coupon folks -- because it was a set menu and so the kitchen didn't want to make things not on THAT menu -- despite our paying full freaking price.FACT: When one is celebrating their birthday, they want a cocktail.  I wanted a cocktail.  Actually, I wanted three.  I got my first cocktail after I'd been there nearly an hour (oh yeah, the "10 minute" wait I was told about was actually 40).  I didn't get a refill.  Or asked if I wanted a refill. Of that drink, or my water.  But I asked!  Oh, did I ask!   I drank my water and my dining companions.  And then eventually drank the melted ice from my un-refilled mojito. The 2 employees (great staffing job on a day you know will be busy with coupon redeemers!) were basically losing their minds, running around, and super stressed.  They had basically given up by the time we were eating. That is why I feel like the food poisoning occurred from something truly awful. Like employees deliberately fucking with my food horrible.I'm not sure what they normally do when people have their birthday at a restaurant, but we weren't offered dessert menus, let alone a comped dessert.  They knew it was my birthday.  They knew at the beginning we were paying the full price.  And still...worst.service.ever.***I actually filled out a comment card back in November listing my email address and phone number, where I specifically requested to be contacted (again, this was before the food poisoning).  This review was written right after the visit, and I sort of "sat" on it for literally over 6 months, in hopes someone would actually contact me.  I gave them the chance, I guess they really just don't give a shit."But I took three years of Spanish and I can't understand anything!" - said my friend. It's not necessary here. Irma was helping us. When I pulled her over to inquire why she was going to cry, it was because a patron couldn't possibly eat his postre. (A general word for dessert.) Irma, our amazing server, laughed when I said I'd take his dessert. This is very laid back, chill place serving authentic food in an unassuming place.I miss hearing my parents and family banter in their Colombian selves. Cubans apparently mix and mingle in a similar fashion. Irma wove her magic throughout the restaurant, smiling and laughing. Quite possibly the happiest woman in Phoenix. (Eventually a delicious red sangria was selected, which went down entirely too fast.)But back to the menu. The menu is clear to understand to anyone, from any corner of the world. Yes, I had a head start as many of the dishes share palates with Colombia. However, the menu here is clearly translated into English for anyone to decipher. No need to fret. And if you're overwhelmed by choices, there are two things that might help you order. Forks designate "Havana Signature Items". Additionally you can opt for a Combination or Sampler plate. It's for the "I Just Don't Know" moments.SEATINGI came here the night someone had their wedding reception! So yes, Havana Cafe readily can accommodate groups. With charm, sincerity and the utmost attention they can provide wonderful service to a party of two. We arrived separately on a Tuesday night around 6-ish pm. Patrons started to trickle in more so around 7pm. Upon arriving I learned there wasn't really a bar area to wait for my friend to arrive. No matter, I was promptly seated even though my party had not fully arrived.FOODEager to eat we ordered fried plantains. When offered an option as to how they were prepared, I jumped and asked for Tostones. The pounded green ones (vs. the sweet kind.) Salty, but not too salty, served with a side of mojo-garlic lime sauce. My mom and aunt prepare them slightly crispier, but these were still delicious.For a meal the Ropa Vieja was divine. Humongous, but delicious. Shredded beef brisket, bell peppers, onions, tomato wine sauce and black beans over rice. I was surprised by the difference in texture of the onions on the rice vs. the brisket. It was nice to have a sweet, fresh onion on the rice. The brisket had a blended texture of spices with the vegetables. (Enough left overs for two more meals. But I'm a girl eating 3 ounces of protein in a meal.)The night was young, and ma ' belly was full. The flan looked tempting. I'll have to send a recon mission back just for that!And yes, the leftovers were excellent :)

This was a great novel thing back in the dayA Chinese restaurant that offered boofayOh but the times they have a-change-edAnd Hong Kong has not arrange-edTo keep up with their competitionOr to make any change or additionTo the way they've always done itSo despite the fire that tried to run it To the ground a few years backHong Kong lingers, although quite whack,The ghosts of americhino lovers' past foraysWill haunt this MSG pit 'till its dying days.To start off, this place is actually called "New Hong Kong" restaurant. http://www.yelp.com/biz/new-hong-kong-phoenix  It was originally called Hong Kong Restaurant from the 1950's and they kept the 60 year old sign in the parking lot (kinda nostalgic).  If you look at the sign on the building, it says New Hong Kong (kind of confusing when you Yelp it)If you ask any of the old school chinese who have lived in central phoenix for the past 50 years where to get authentic home style cooking, they know it's at NHK.If you ask the buffet community where to eat, this place is probably not on the top 100 (disclaimer:  I've never eaten the lunch buffet)Sadly, it seems that the old school chinese community that patronize this place don't give it the Yelp reviews that it deserves, hence the low ratings.If you're looking for traditional Cantonese style food, here's a list of semi-authentic stuff I recommend:1) Beef chow fun2) Tomato beef over Hong Kong style noodles3) Fish filet over Gai Lon (Chinese broccoli)4) Salt/pepper chicken wings (not on the menu)5) Peking pork chops6) West lake beef soup7) X.O. green beansIf you want to go hard core Toi-sahn hillbilly style home cooking like poh-poh and ngain-ngain used to make:1) Hom-yee guy lup chow fon (preserved salty fish, with chicken fried rice)2) Foo-guah guy, Ow-see (Bitter melon chicken with black been sauce)3) Gee-ngoke-beng (Steamed pork with preserved salty fish)4) Hoh-yeow gai-lon (Steamed chinese brocolli with oyster sauce)5) Bok-jom-guy (Boiled chicken with garlic and ginger sauce)6) Muy-choi-kow-yuk (Fatty pork hot-pot with preserved vegetable)7) Bok choy with black mushroomOccasionally, they will bring out the compimentary house special Doang-guah gong (winter melon) or linh-gnaw gong (some sort of chinese turnip) soup.This place is a well kept secret, spread the wealth I tell ya.

So....You say you want authentico?? My family secret shhhh! This place is owned by a lady named Maria. We have dubbed this place just "Maria's" we have been going here for year's!! When the white folk's around me say let's go to Valley Luna I have to school them on what's real food. This food is pure Jalisco and it is what it is! If you want some good home style cookin' in this part of town I would stop in for a bite! You better believe that this place gets busy for dinner so plan accordingly or don't go at peak times for those who don't like crowds. This is a nice little place w a bar and tv's. My sibling's would live here if they could my sister swears by the green chili burro, not for the weak as it brings the heat. I don't eat meat so I get the norm cheese enchiladas, chile relleno, etc all super in my book. I will take pics soon in the meantime here is a recent write up about the place http://www.azcentral.com/ent/dining/articles/2008/03/20/20080320elconquistador.htmlP.S. Closed Monday's

==Gay Denny's Bingo==[ ] Uncomfortable looking straight couple. What, you thought they called it "gay denny's" because it was so merry?[ ] Half-drunk valley girl frantically slapping her boyfriend in the face. Whether it's to get him out of his drunken stupor or to arouse him, it doesn't seem to be working, babe.[ ] Random cop harassing transexual/transvestite about "being lewd in public" or some other bullshit. Lewd? You're the one trying to put them handcuffs and take them to your car. Get over your lame self.[ ] Waitress who has to wake up passed out patrons to bring them their food. [ ] Guy who leaves instructions for his friends to order for him so he can get his puke on. (Holy shit...Nathan?)[ ] People fixing their makeup...in the men's restroom.[ ] Glitter on the seats. And the table. Oh my god where is all this fucking glitter coming from?[ ] Guy who, despite seeing that really hot girl making out with another girl, still thinks he's got a chance, and seems legitimately confused when girl is not interested in him. Just because her girlfriend's in the toilet doesn't mean she goes into "straight mode" for the next ten minutes. [ ] Dumb yelper taking notes for a future review. (Holy shit...me?)Ahhhh....Jenny's. Good ole Jenny's. Gay as gay can be. Depending on when you are there of course. I've found myself at Jenny's post bar rush stuffing my pie hole with a club sandwich, fries and many glasses of Coca Cola. Then there's the late morning, early afternoon call from friends who want to gather at Jenny's, eat greasy food to soak up the previous evening's booze and dish about who fell down, who got arrested and who will end up on dirty.com! Of course, we all secretly hope it is us!I love diner waitresses. They get it. They have the patience of a saint and the sass and swagger of a sailor. All the while delivering my hot plate of eggs, shredded hash browns (can you say Ore Ida!?), various meats and extra butter on the toast please. God bless 'em. God bless them all! So Jenny's has a place in our hearts. Not on Valentine's Day. Not on the books for New Year's Eve. But, dayum, if I'm not grateful to have you Jenny on that famous CenPho corner, we call 7th Street and Camelback.

Took my 96 year old dad here for lunch.  He wanted potato pancakes without looking at the menu.  We ordered them and he LOVED them.  Said they were the best he has had and wants to go back for more.I had a very nice veal and mushroom "stew" on top of Spatzle, the German home made egg noodles.  They were excellent and when I gave some to my dad he said that next time he wants a large bowl of Spatzle with butter and salt.No, he is not really easy to please, but the Waldhorn pleases him and that pleased us.

Like many institutions in Phoenix, you can't live here unless you LOVE Pete's!! I have seen and heard many a Phoenician defend their beloved Pete's as they would that other famous fast food mecca Carolina's. I have lived in Phoenix my entire life and love Pete's and this is why I can stay! lol. From the street, it looks like an old take-out place that's all cute and retro... but noooooo... it's really an old take out place. and it produces some serious food! Whenever I go, I always peek at the mini factory of people dredging and frying all sorts of goodies. Shrimp (my fave), fish filets, hush puppies, corndogs, burritos and fries. Once upon a time there used to be signs that read "NO TATAR SAUCE, SO DON'T EVEN ASK!" and all you had was Pete's patented red sauce that was part ketchup, part hot sauce but all lovely. Pete's sauce made everything taste better. It went well with the corndogs, the burritos, the fish, the shrimp, the fries and don't even get me started on the burgers!Sadly, after DECADES of refusing the Phoenix masses their precious tartar sauce and forcing them to enjoy Pete's sauce (for their own good) Pete's has caved and now offers Tartar sauce... and it sucks! So now many people won't even get the chance to even try the glorious Pete's sauce... cuz they want their old standard Tartar sauce! *sigh* My fellow yelpers, if you haven't had Pete's yet - GO! And try the fish & shrimp combo and if your appetite is healthy - try a small burger and get extra sauce and enjoy!! It's worth it!! :)

Review Text :
This restaurant is 5 stars for the view alone (which is what everyone else has mentioned), but the food and service are excellent too. The other night my girlfriend and I went back for the first time since the amazing Yelp event earlier in the year. We started the night off with a drink at sunset on the outdoor patio, overlooking most of Phoenix. Then we headed inside for our dinner and the manager greeted us with a "Thank you for coming back to Different Pointe of View," which I thought was a nice touch. I assume he knew we were returning since I mentioned we had a card for a free bottle of sparkling wine when I made the reservations weeks before. We were seated inside near the window and our waiter was very friendly and attentive. Our bottle of Champagne was presented to us to start the night and we placed our food orders. We decided to split the Braised Duck Ravioli ($12) and the Pan Seared Diver Scallops ($15). There were two raviolis and two scallops per order and we felt both dishes great choices. The scallops were some of the best I have ever had. For our main course we each ordered the Grilled Cedar River Filet Mignon ($38). The perfectly prepared tenderloin steak was accompanied with horseradish crust, Swiss chard, roasted fingerling potatoes, smoked apple wood bacon, chives, Crème Fraiche and port wine pomegranate reduction. No I didn't memorize all of that, of course I retyped it from the menu.For dessert we split the Classic Tahitian Vanilla Bean Crème Brulee (all desserts $9). It was delicious, but rather small and didn't quite satisfy my sweet tooth. The buttercream blue cheese cookie and fresh strawberries were a nice addition, but even with those it was too small a dish. Overall, I 100% recommend you stop in and have dinner and drinks at Different Pointe of View. It has been one of my favorite Phoenix restaurants for many years. It's a perfect place for locals and out of town visitors alike. My only recommendations for improvements would be to add a server or two to the outside patio bar area since it tends to be slow on busy evenings. Also, I think the names for some of their dishes are a bit much and could be shortened.I came here with my two sisters a couple weeks ago and all three of us agreed it was one of the best experience dining experiences any of us had ever had. We had gotten a limousine so that we didn't need a DD but we were disappointed when the driver informed us he would have to drop us off at the resort so we could take a shuttle to the top (the road is too steep and narrow for a limo). The friendly shuttle driver told us that this is a common surprise to groups coming for special occasion parties like the prom. So, just something to be aware of. Once we got up to the top, it really did feel like the place was built right into the mountain top. You can see the exposed rock of the cliffside surrounding the entrance. It was very cool. We rode an elevator to the top floor and you could see why they wanted to be as high up as possible. The view was stunning. I am sure it would be gorgeous at sunset but this was around 8pm and I personally really enjoyed being able to see all the city lights shimmering below us. The design of the restaurant is upscale but understated; they keep everything neutral so that the large wall of floor to ceiling windows is the main focus.We decided to do the tasting menu and I am so glad we did. It was worth every penny ($80pp plus $40 for wine). The portions were a decent size and every one was delicious and unique. My sisters requested no shellfish or veal (and unfortunately I had to comply) so the chef substituted two of the dishes with something else. Our waiter was very diligent about making sure that we were all happy. We started with a piece of pork belly with wild mushrooms on a bed of bleu cheese polenta. This was a surprising first course (I think it was supposed to be shrimp) but I loved it! The pork melted in my mouth and I loved the tangy bleu cheese mixed with the creamy polenta. We had gotten the wine pairing as well so the sommelier made his appearance and explained that since we were changing up the dishes he was changing up the wines as well. He selected a very light red that had enough tannins to complement the pork and the cheese but was still light enough for a first course. This wine is not on their list but he had a couple bottles that he was trying out himself and he picked that one for us since he knew it would go with the dish that the chef had changed around for us. I couldn't believe how accommodating the staff was to their guests and how coordinated and educated they were. Second course we got a Pillsbury Rose which was also fantastic and the sommelier told us all about the history of this local winery and some stories about the AZ wine culture in general. It was awesome. The wine went perfectly with the salad we were served of assorted micro-greens with fresh currants and a tangy, fruity vinaigrette. A nice surprise was that under the greens were some hamachi sashimi. The fish was delectable and the salad was an explosion of flavors. I love dried currants in baked goods and currant jam but I have never in my life even seen a fresh currant, never mind bunches of them still on the vine. It was very cool! The next course was the fish course, accompanied by a crisp white blend. I am not a fan of sea bass but this one was cooked perfectly and it was a different type that was pink like salmon. I confess it did not convert me to being a sea bass lover but I loved the vegetables it was served with so much that I scraped up the remaining sauce with the rest of the bread in the bread basket (which was a very tasty focaccia, btw). The last course was the highlight of the whole experience. It was medallions of venison tenderloin. They were well-done (which is how I like my meat) but still completely fork-tender. The sauce for this dish was equally delectable, a sweet red wine reduction. The flavors in this dish were fantastic and the portion size was so large that my sisters had to take half of theirs home. The wine for this dish was a wonderful red that was so amazing I am going to go hunt it down and I will buy at least one bottle no matter how much it costs. I managed to save a bit to go with my chocolate cake dessert. The cake was good but it also came with a small cup of a super-thick and creamy hot chocolate that was out-of-this world. I thought it was great that we each got to pick our own dessert but my sisters both ended up not caring for theirs. One ordered the Apples on the Rocks, which is the one all the Yelpers raved about but it was completely tasteless and boring. It tasted like they had messed up and forgotten a few ingredients (like sugar?). My other sister ordered the chocolate and chestnuts dessert which was at least passable but somewhat blah. The boring desserts were not a big deal, though, since by that point we were sooo full!It was such a fantastic experience from start to finish I really think this is one of those places every Phoenician must go at least once. Great food, great service, great ambiance. I highly recommend!Dined on Friday, 2/22/13. My wife and I recently moved to the Phoenix area from Chicago and I really had no idea about where to dine. It was my wife's birthday and I wanted to dine at least at a 4 star restaurant- so I came to Yelp for advice.Our reservation was 8:15pm and we arrived at 7:55pm. We were invited to sit in the lounge area, which we did, and I expected to do so since we were so early.  We sat in the lounge for about 10 mins and were not approached by a server. In fact, I thought there were no servers since I saw none on the floor so I went to the bar and ordered myself, just like I would at a Chicago neighborhood bar. (Irk#1)Drinks were good and strong, but REALLY pricey- $26 for 2 drinks.Around 8:30pm, we went back to the hostess desk as no one came to get us for our reservation yet, (they said they would find us in the lounge). We were told our table still wasn't ready and to wait by the fireplace. I was a little peeved now and Iwould have expected to wait if I was late- but we were sufficiently on time I thought. We were seated after waiting another 5 mins or so. (8:45pm-30 mins late)(Irk#2) The wait staff, I thought, were pretty good overall. They did a lot of table "hopping", i.e. covered each other's tables, so diners were well taken care of yet not too pushy or chatty.We both ordered the lobster bisque soup. I ordered the halibut and my wife ordered the scallops. Bread was not brought to the table until after we ordered dinner- which was 10 mins after we were seated. (irk #3) The sourdough bread was excellent. The focaccia bread was kind of bland and dry. There were 3 dipping sides offered with the bread, which were very good. Lobster bisque was quite delicious. They put this "hydroponically infused" basil seasoning on top of the soup that was very good. I thought the soup was a little overcooked (sitting in the pot too long taste) but still good. My dinner arrived hot and the halibut was bland and little overcooked. (pan-fried). I asked for 2 more pieces of the sourdough bread to eat with my dinner and we were told they were "out" of sourdough. (irk#4). Friday night dinner service and out of bread? Really? My wife's scallops were cool as well as her vegetable sides on the plate. (irk #5)The waiter didn't check on us until 10 mins after the dinner was serves (irk#6) so it wasn't feasible to send it back to get reheated. The waiter offered us comp deserts for the trouble, at least.The last irk (#7) was that we asked for a bag to put our left-over take home boxes in- 3 total boxes. The waiter said they "were out of bags". He checked twice and the 3rd time brought us a Home Depot bag. I asked if he went to his car to get it. How difficult would it have been for the restaurant manager to go down to the gift shop and grab a couple of dozen bags? Maybe my expectations are too high since I'm from Chicago(?), but when  a restaurant is rated 5 stars by all of you Yelpers, I expect a little better service when dropping a couple of hundred bucks. Other than the view and the ambiance- I wouldn't recommend this restaurant.I really want this place to be more than exceptional but after the second visit (months after the first) I can only say this:  you pay too much for the view.The service is very old-fashioned and very doting but the menu needs a re-think.  Times have changed but this place is stuck in the 90's.  bottom line, it is an overly expensive resort restaurant with OK food and exhorbitant prices.I've lived here my whole life (28 years, dude) and strangely enough have never been to this place. Well, I finally went here last night with my sexy-pants boyfriend. His pants are sexy.So, it takes a few minutes to get to the actual restaurant. You drive higher and higher and higher and then directly into outer space. Finally, when you arrive to the top, complimentary valet is waiting for you. Which I zipped right past because I refuse to valet my expensive 2011 standard Golf. I probably should've valeted though, because then I was forced to walk up a slanted hill in 6" heels and had to cling to sexy-pants boyfriend like an old lady with brittle bones. Once inside, you then go up yet another flight of stairs (don't worry, there's an elevator) where you are finally greeted by the hostess. The restaurant itself is interesting - large, glass windows so you can enjoy the view, said Captain Obvious. Aside from that, it's rather plain and even on the drab side. I'm not saying that's a negative. It could be purposeful to not retract from the view? I dunno. The view is seriously spectacular though! I love the desert and this only amplified my love for it. I know there's a lot of haters in Phoenix who talk shit about how ugly this city is. You shut your damn mouth. If you're one of these haters, I encourage you to visit places like this that give you a profound appreciation of how neat mountains and clear skies really are.Onto the food: Pretty good! Expensive, as one would expect, but not outrageous. I ordered a "micro greens" salad with pistachios, pears, and some type of cheese I'd never heard of it. The salad was truly micro and was almost deconstructed, which I'm not a fan of. I'm lazy and don't want to put my food together. It came out on an overly-HUGE plate and I nearly guffawed at it! Hahaha! It looked really silly and even tinier. Overall though it was pretty good. I also had a side of fingerling potatoes and those were GREAT! S.P. Boyfriend had the chef's special, which was shrimp with kidney beans (I think, can't remember). It was very tasty. We followed all of that up with the peanut butter and chocolate cheesecake - definitely the highlight of the evening. The entire bill came to $76 - not bad! Afterward we went outside to check out the rest of the restaurant and made the treacherous trek back down to my baller car, where my boyfriend literally piggybacked me so I didn't have to break my ankles.Overall, pretty cool place! Friendly staff, great views. Clearly I have run out of things to say.

Review Text :
Dirty, unclean, my friend and I went to lunch here.  She went to go to the bathroom. Upon returning to the table had the following story to tell.  To get to the bathroom she had to go through the kitchen and down a flight a stairs. When passing through the kitchen she saw raw chicken left out in the heat congealing in it's own blood.  Christos you get no second chances after a stunt like that.  The food was tasty, but come on now chicken chillen on the counter is a no go in anyone's kitchen.This place is a run down, out dated, hole in the wall restaurant with slow service and creepy decor.. and it's fabulous. When you walk into the Christos, don't expect to be greeted- you won't be (unless someone pulled you in off the street). Plan on walking to the back to find someone who may or may not seat you, or you may be told to sit wherever you want.  I would recommend sitting outside, although not your typical "patio seating" ambience,  it's (in my opinion) the better option. It's teeny tiny and super old school. The menus are old and messy, but you're not eating those anyway, right?So all of that aside, Christos is a really fantastic little family owned authentic Greek place that serves really great food. They serve it slow, but they serve it good!  I ordered the hummus and pita bread as an appetizer  (yummm) and the Greek Pizza as my meal, and it was so good! I really loved it, and you can't beat the prices. My lunch was all of $12, and I ordered a soft drink, an appetizer, and a pizza that came with a salad... and it was good! The point to me pointing out all of the negatives first was that you can't ignore the obvious and pretend it doesn't exist.. truth is, all that stuff is true. But if you're prepared for it and willing to overlook it, you will leave pleased. Just keep in mind that it is a family owned establishment- there's no advertising, no sponsors, no corporate funding.. don't go in expecting top notch service, or hip decorations. But do go in expecting genuine, sincere service and great food. Give Christos a chance, maybe it's your thing and maybe you can't get on board, but I will always look past an exterior for good food and to support a local business!

Review Text :
What a production! I don't even know where to start...The place is small.  They didn't lie to me when I made the reservation.  Of course we had to pick the busiest day and time, Saturday at 7pm.  The nice lady on the phone told me a reservation helps but we may still have to wait.  I did appreciate that tip from her.  Sure enough, we showed up and it's PACKED!  The unfortunate thing is it was cold, so eating on their patio was not going to happen.  Therefor, people cram into what tiny space is allowed in the front.  But when I say tiny, I really mean no space at all.  An older man pretty much barked orders at us and demanded to know if we had a reservation.  Thank God we did, I was a little scared of him when he ran off muttering about no seating in you ain't got reservations.  So the first table of the restaurant is thee worst, because people are standing on top of you jealously staring down at you and your food.  Of course we ended up with that table!  Thankfully, our server and anyone else helping out was extremely friendly and helpful and made us feel comfortable.  We started with the mussels app.  It came in a light garlic sauce and was a good amount of mussels.  I'd say they were pretty tasty and I loved dipping the bread into the sauce.  The bread actually became my best companion that night... more on that later!I ordered the gnocchi with tomato sauce and mozz cheese.  I LOVE when Italian restaurants dump the sauce on and this was a winner.  I LOVE SAUCE!  I know some people aren't into that, so I'll warn you if you like light sauce, you WON'T be happy.  After having gnocchi at Il Pizzaiolo in South Hills earlier that week (I know, I'm on an Italian kick!) it didn't hold a candle to those light little pillows of pasta and potato.  The sauce though, delicious!  Much to my husbands chagrin, I had a hard time keeping myself from grabbing his plate!  He had the spinach and ricotta ravioli, which I didn't have have a bite of... but the SAUCE.... oh my!  Orgasmic!  I love tomato cream sauce and this was amazing!  I kept dipping my bread into his sauce, with him increasingly getting annoyed.  Did I want to risk a fight for that delicious sauce... maybe!!  It was soooo good!  But the real action took place as we were finishing up our meal.  I had noticed the older dude/owner walking around with a glass of red wine the whole time.  I thought that he was pretty rude, but kinda funny, in a typical Italian way.  Well, I start to sense a commotion beside me and realize the owner and a server are in a heated convo.  Then the older dude screams "get outta here you F*%& A@#hole!" and then shoves him!  Whoa!!  I was shocked a boss would do that to an employee.  Come to find out it's his son.  A woman, who I assume was also part of management (maybe even a family member!), came over to our table and apologized, joked this was normal Italian behavior and offered us free dessert.  I thought that was really nice of her and and appreciated.   I just feel bad because those kind of things take down a business.  The good was great, but witnessing that, you wonder how long you can work like that.  Hopefully the dude can retire to a nice Italian villa with lots of wine instead of screaming at his son in the middle of his restaurant!My girlfriend has been a regular of this place for years and could not wait to take me when I came in town for the Steelers game. We did not make a reservation and showed up on a busy saturday night around 8:45pm fully expecting a long wait. My girlfriend had forewarned me that there will be a wait so when we showed up we just expected to put our names down and go across the street for a drink while we waited. We ended up waiting in the front of the restaurant for ~20 minutes without anyone taking down our name. A few waitresses mentioned that the older italian guy (owner) took down names. We were ignored several times by him as he came up front - no biggie we saw it was busy. An older woman came up to us several times and asked if we had been helped, we replied no, and she reiterated that the older man dealt with the "list". We were fine up through now and were still waiting when the older guy came up to the front and shoved the older woman (his wife?) and proceeded to scream at her for several minutes. The entire restaurant went quiet and was staring at the front of the restaurant (where we were awkwardly standing as well). The older gentleman was screaming that she was always interfering with the list and he was done with it. He kept going on and said that why did she even care about a couple of "out of towners" who will never come back again. (which was even more shocking because my girlfriend was a regular and had regularly conversed with the man many times before). We subsequently left while the man was still screaming at the woman. This was the most absurd display at a restaurant I have ever seen. My girlfriend was extremely upset especially for the physical violence the man was displaying. This was no casual shove but rather a full two handed violent push followed by pounding his fist on the table and screaming at the woman in front of the entire restaurant. Needless to say we will never come back and recommend people boycott a place where the owner treats his (wife/employee) with such disrespect regardless of how stressed he may be on a busy night.I came here with a friend for dunch (is that a thing?) before heading out to a show at the First Niagara Pavilion on Sat.  Given that we arrived shortly after 4pm, I doubted this place would be busy--and it wasn't--which worked out perfectly, in light of this place's size and popularity during normal dinner hours on the weekend.Based on the recommendation of my labmate and other Yelpers, I ordered the spinach and ricotta ravioli, and it didn't disappoint.  The pasta was perfectly tender without being mushy, and the filling was savory and delicious.  As Rachel C. pointed out in her review, this place is quite generous with the sauce, which is great because this was the best part of the dish!  It was a tomato cream sauce that was delicious in its own right, but that complemented the savoriness of the ravioli fillings well.  After finishing my raviolis, I asked for some more bread and used it to sop up the remainder of the sauce.  My dish also came with the Girasole salad--a tossed salad dressed with sunflower seeds (how cute, in light of the meaning of the restaurant's name!)--that served as a great appetizer to the meal.  About the only part of my meal that wasn't noteworthy was the bread, which was fine, but just your standard Italian bread.Since he wasn't as hungry as me, my dining companion ordered the bruschetta, which also came with a salad.  It wasn't your standard bruschetta, however--it consisted of what looked like chopped squash with prosciutto on toasted flatbread.  I'm not sure how much he enjoyed it, since he left a fair amount of the squash and prosciutto on his plate.  However, I wouldn't count this as a strike against the dish or the restaurant, since he can be a pretty picky eater.  I didn't taste the bruschetta in its entirety, so I can't pass my own judgment on it, unfortunately.As others have mentioned, the dining area is definitely small and intimate, and the tables are quite close to one another.  However, this wasn't a problem for us since the restaurant was only about 1/3 full when we were dining, due to being there on an off hour.  We really liked the ambience, which I'd describe as rustic but classy, and it didn't feel like basement dining even though it was.  The waitstaff all seemed quite jovial with one another, which was fun to observe.  I have no complaints about the service we received.Overall, we had a nice experience here, and would definitely return.  Given the popularity of this place, if you want to avoid some of the problems mentioned in other reviews due to the small space, I'd recommend going for lunch or during an off time.  This is definitely one of the better Italian restaurants I've eaten at thus far in PGH, so if you're in the mood for this type of food, give it a try!

Two words: Doggy, I mean ANIMAL STYLE. (Excuse my adult context, please keep children away from this review.)Anyways, once you go black, I MEAN A-style, there's just no going back, period. ;-OThis is the best upgrade you could possibly do to a burger especially here! Can't believe it took me this long to discover their "secret." The components of ANIMAL STYLE is simple yet genius:+ In-N-Out's thousand island spread (combined with...)+ Caramelized, chopped onions (star of the show)+ Cheese (if not a cheeseburger already)Voila! Now take it down like the Animal you are! Cuz you're rough like that. ;-) It's a little messy but very manageable as you chomp your way through.Wait, there's more! If you like a little kick, say: "chopped chili's" Bam son! You got yourself some heat with that A-style.  Level 2 Complete.  Optionally, you can have a whole, uncut Chili Pepper on the side.Its just not the burger you can apply the A-style to, yes, your fries can get the same treatment.  Unless you like it all sloppy and want to eat it with a fork, I would keep your fries untainted.  Well, there you have it, I hope I was informative and inspiring that you will now go try this "Animal Style" at an In-N-Out near you!

Nico's is one of my favorite Yinzer bars.  I've been going here off and on since I turned 21, even if it was just to stop in for fries at lunch, and it's one of the finest dives around.We typically stop in here for a fish sandwich and some drinks after the Unblurred gallery crawl in Garfield.  Jason bartends on Friday nights, and he's the best.  He's one of those bartenders that remembers you after your first visit, and remembers what you drink and keeps the refills coming.Their food is excellent.  The fish sandwich is church-fish-fry good, and the coleslaw is crispy and mayonnaise-d to perfection.  But the real treat of this place is the fries.  There's something about these fries that I just love.  I think they remind me of the homemade fries my grandpa used to make me in his deep fryer when I was a kid.  They're kind of like a thinner, jucy-er version of Potato Patch fries.  Seriously.  Go get some now.And like other dive bars in Pittsburgh, the prices are cheap.  This is the perfect place to sit around with your fellow Yinzers and watch the Buccos or the Pens (or both, if it's that glorious time of year when both seasons are going - they have multiple TVs).The only thing I don't like about Nico's is that it's one of the few smoking-permitted bars left in town (they, like Thunderbird and the Cage, keep the food prices low to skirt that smoking ban loophole).  I've gotten kind of spoiled lately by smoke-free establishments, and I hate coming home stinking like cigarettes.But the dives in Pittsburgh are all pretty much maintaining the smoking thing, so I can't complain when comparing.  All that said, there's no bar I'd rather hang out at than Nico's.  :)

So...it's been at least two years since I've been to McNinch and I still remember the experience like it was yesterday. And I have to agree with Bill on this one, it's pretty amazing.Hubs and I decided to try this illustrious resto for Valentine's Day in 2008, we went through the whole reservation process, custom menu, custom wine pairings - the whole shebang. We actually followed all their directions to a t and arrive early, enjoyed some champagne while taking a tour of the sweet little home/restaurant on Church St. And then the incredible began...We were blown away (for the entire 3+ hours) by the spectacular pairings of food and wine, accompanied by fantastic service. I know we saved our menu for quite some time, but I'm not sure where it ran off to. Every single course was creatively prepared and tons of local ingredients were immersed into the dishes. Our server was also extremely knowledgable in each wine, explaining its heritage and vineyard to us. Since we choose the wine pairing option, we quite literally had a different (and interesting) glass of wine with every of the seven courses. Good thing we lived in the Fourth Ward at that time. Hey-oo!McNinch House is such a special place to experience an amazing meal. It's pricey and well worth every penny: I'm still talking about my meal 2.5 years later. We probably spent about $400 all in, including the wine pairings for each of us, seven courses and tip. An expensive meal for sure, but it's wonderful for a anniversary or milestone celebration.Of course I cant afford a real meal here but to feel part of the ELITE I go for the wine tastings!!!  They are almost every other Monday, sometimes they will have them outside but usually they are inside their spectacular dining rooms.  Yes, the house is stunning and historic if you like antiques and victorian style decor.  The wine tastings are $20 bucks per person and include usually 7 or so wines and heavy apps.  You can wander throughout the downstairs or on the peaceful porch with your wine.  It is the perfect Monday happy hour!  Love you McNinch!!!  :-DIll start my review by stating that ive been working in the food industry for 7 years now, all fine dining.  I know what works and what doesnt, and what i should expect when eatting at places. With that being said.My wife and dined here and i was very disappionted with the over all experiance.  I think the thing that bothered me the most was the wine manager, after saying that we would be hving a 6 course dinner and would not be pairing it with the wine but would be ordering individual glasses of wine and cocktails he just lost all interest in providing an enjoyable experiance. After ordering our first drinks and finishing it, a manhattan for myself and champagne for her i was asked if we would like another drink; which i agreed to. instead of bringing out the wine menu again i was made to just state what type of wine i would like, the sommelier brought a glass of cab and just dropped it at the table- no mention of year, make, and region, just a heres a glass of wine, i didnt know if it was a 5 dollar a bottle wine or a 35 dollar a glass wine, nothing. And on top of it all it was corked. Luckally they removed it and took it off the bill, they brought out another and the som just dropped it off again, i had to stop him before he walked away and ask what he just gave us, he repllied a cabernet. I litterally had to prompt him with " where does it come from, when was it made, who makes it."If i could grade just the som i would give him a zero, the man has given up on even trying to provide for his clients.Getting into the food, it was ok not worth what we paid for, the amuse was enjoyable, as well as the duck which was cooked perfectly, but the other 4 courss were average. The smoked sweet potato puree, coupled with the beef and sauce was just way too sweet, totally killed the meat.I think what put the nail in the coffin while eatting here was the check at the end.  They automatically add 20% gratutity to the bill, it doesnt matter what type of service you get. With the staff already nowing they are getting theirs is it any wonder they could care less.Four star 4 diamond yea right.Can't even begin to describe this place.  First off, the house itself is incredible.  A throwback to craftsmanship construction and not a detail left unattended.  Regarding the food, there's not another place in Charlotte that can even come close to it in my opinion.  We were here celebrating and decided on the Chef's Tasting menu which is a 9-course dinner and I'm not going to belabor you all with the details of each and every dish.  I'll just say that the dishes were thoughtful, creative and cooked to perfection with the touch of a culinary artist.The service was impeccable and not once did we feel rushed to finish or hurry along.  When you reserve here, you basically have the table for the night and that's a good thing because our dinner was over the span of 3 hours (slightly more).  We did chat it up a bit with the staff though.Parking is valet only and is directly behind the house.Bottom line, McNinch is a must do for locals and people visiting alike.Long time Charlotte establishment McNinch House is a dining experience, not just a restaurant. Located in a beautiful Fourth Ward Victorian house, you are dining in an elegant setting. Make sure that you really like the person you're with because an evening at McNinch House is an investment in time. Enjoy yourself - do not feel rushed - pace your beverages - dinner will definitely take a while.My dining partner and I chose the four course dinner. There are options that offer additional courses as well as wine parings if you wish. Wine is also available by the glass, bottle and as flights. We chose crab cakes as our first course. When the plates were served, I thought I was seeing two small biscuits on the plate (yes, the lighting is somewhat dim.) The crab cakes were beautiful and wonderful. The two crab cakes were predominantly chunks of crab with very little seasoning, dusted with a soft flour and very lightly browned. They were served with a lightly dressed slaw and the combination was right on. Perfect. Being in a crab state of mind, we chose she crab soup for our second course. The creme fraiche made in house really added to the flavor of this dish. The small addition of sherry was just right.My companion and I parted company with the entree. She had the rack of lamb and I chose the duck breast. The rack of lamb was cooked to perfection, nicely displayed and exactly what she expected. My duck breast was also perfectly cooked. It was served with a cherry reduction and sweet potato hash. For dessert, we chose their evening's cheesecake. Thinking I would receive the normal size portion, I thought I would be wasting much of my dessert. When the plates arrived, I was very pleased to see a beautiful, small portion. The flavor was wonderful. I ate the whole thing! It was just right.With one exception, the food was five stars. Unfortunately I detected a slight burned flavor in the cherry reduction. It was about 30 seconds too cooked. But that was not enough to ruin the whole food experience.My greater concern involved service. McNinch House is a first class restaurant. I didn't feel like the service was first class for these reasons: we arrived about 10 minutes before our reservation time. The door was locked and after a while we were met at the door by one of the servers. We felt awkward when he said for us to wait and look around if we wished. I would have preferred him to take my coat then and offer to take a drink order. The waiting was not a problem, the awkwardness was. Secondly, the servers did not stick with the tried and true rules of which side to serve and from which side to remove plates. In several instances the servers crossed in front of us to remove something from the table in spite of the fact there was plenty of room behind both of us. Lastly, I don't mind an automatic gratuity and I don't object to a 20% gratuity since I normally tip that amount anyway. What I do object to is tipping on the taxed amount. This means I am tipping on more than 20% and I don't think that is right at all.I hope to someday return to McNinch House. I do recommend this restaurant with some reservation (but not the food - it was wonderful.)

I totally expect to see Mel Sharpel's slinging hash in the kitchen with Alice, Flo and Vera, in those cute waitress outfits, tending to the eclectic brood of diners. And while the fictional characters from my past aren't here, you will find some REAL characters. My favorite is the older couples who don't speak to each other but instead read the newspaper. And the trucker guy who says things like "Thanks little lady". Not to be rude, I just batted my eyelashes and said, "Why you're welcome trucker man."  All the servers are women who know their regulars names and what they want. Without fail. Though I"m not much of a pie guy (insert homo joke here), people line up for Peggy's Pies. Me? I'm all about breakfast on the weekends and anything with gravy. Come for the meatloaf, chicken fried chicken or the biscuits but stay for the pie. It's like taking a trip to the midwest without the cavity search at Sky Harbor.I probably wouldn't have come here but for some reason I was reading the Yelp reviews and bookmarked this place. Checked off. Seen this place before and very very unassuming cafe in the strip mall. We walk in and not sure what to expect. One of the waitress tells us to just take a table. So we sit down and there is crumbs on the table. Wife is freaking out (Scottsdale woman)  hahaha. One of the customers gets up and says I will get that cleaned up for you. Man is this place different. It seems something like the 60's or maybe like home. Waitress are just talking to the customers. Joking and everything. Just like home. Not your normal cafe. I ordered the ultimate skillet. It had home potatoes, bacon, ham, sausage, onions, peppers with eggs on top with a side of English muffin. I really love home potatoes. I thought it was pretty good. Tasty, huge portion and filling. Not bad. My wife for the Caesars chicken salad. This was very very different salad than other places we visited. Nice chunks of chicken, bacon, and egg. I was able to sneak a few bites and it was really good. It comes with Texas toast. My wife really liked the salad and toast. Usually she doesn't eat the bread with her salad but not today. She really like it. As for the service, these servers are like your family. Seemed like your aunts or something. Take you order, fills you water glasses and coffee but never asked how everything is cause it's seems like home. Like family. Very homie place. Only talking at this place was with the waitresses. My wife was a little uncomfortable cause it's such a small place that everyone hears your conversations so no one talks too much but with staff. I liked the place. Huge menu. Let's put it this was family atmosphere (your treated like family), good food, huge portions. If you come here just be ready for a different environment. Loved it that on the walls are pictures of veterans. Leave your Scottsdale attitude out the door and just enjoy this different cafe. Enjoy.

Badger game disappointment! Watered down drinks, slow service and rude management! My husband and I have watched many badger games at Pedro's. Good drink specials and multiple TVs have made this our go to spot for years. The service is always slow and the food is just decent but it's a good spot to watch a game...Tonight was a completely different story! My Guinness tasted just like water, I suspect it was watered down. Our service was super slow. We were there for over 30 minutes before we received chips and salsa. The chips were hot but they needed salt. Their salsa tasted like ketchup. Once we ordered, again our food took forever. My cousin asked for sour cream and waited another 20 minutes for it. My food was ok. The tamale was actually pretty good. It needed spice though.The kicker was when the manager, Brett, started changing the channels shortly after halftime! We asked the waitress what was going on. We came for a badger game. Our menus had badger specials, FB also listed their badger specials. Having just received our food... Yes it took two quarters, we couldn't relocate to another establishment. Apparently, there was a UFC fight on. We asked to speak to management, this is when we met Brett.We asked about the game. He refused to turn the game back on stating that they paid $2000.00 for the UFC fight and they were going to show it. I looked around at the sea of red and asked him what his current demographic/ customer base thought of missing the second half of the game. He again referenced the cost. His solution was to have us move tables in the middle of our dinner to be in view of a smaller tv with no sound! Worst of all was when I told him we wouldn't be returning because of this he said,"Ok." He clearly doesn't care about his customers! Awful!

As many yelpers have said perfectly...the Village Green is the idealistic neighborhood tap.  I hadn't been in over 10 years, and walking back in the place looked exactly the same.  Some would call it a bad thing, but I find it endearing.  We've been back a few times now and love going with friends for a casual Friday night.  Great specials (love the Friday fish...but be prepared to eat only fried food).  My all-time favorite is their summer sausage reuben...if you love reubens you cannot go wrong with this jewel!  Fries are always hot and fresh and service is always friendly.  One of Middleton's best kept local secrets!

Review Text :
UPDATE 5/19/2008Finally. Me and the Thaiger are purring like happy kittens. I've discovered their yellow curry at lunch and it is dee lish! Prices are insanely low, tho the lunch menu is limited. Service is upbeat and more polished. Now, a purrrrfect place for me to lunch!!! Hello Kitty!!!!I think Hello Kitty is wildier than this cat. Veggie tempura. I've had crispier wafers from a priest. Pad Thai. Wouldn't say it was bad, but, hmmm, what's the word I'm thinking of, oh, I know BLAND! I've had tastier wafers from a priest. I love the chef. Very approachable and like, totally, super nice. Wait staff, on the two occasions I've been there, were a little inactive. I've had more action from a priest. I'll go again. Try new things. But only after I do the Rosary.3/5/10My second attempt to dine here, as it was so busy the first time (and so noisy!), that I had to leave.  (It was during lunch hours, and I don't like to wait.)  Arrived a few minutes shy of the end of lunch, so I was able to dine in peace.  Ordered the tofu green curry and the fried banana and coconut ice cream for dessert.  I found the portion of the entree to be very skimpy for the price, and I've had much tastier, and creamier, curry sauce elsewhere (Tottie's, Thai Elephant, even Yupha's!).  Need I say more?  Seriously, WT's green curry tastes about the same as Thai Hut's, but at a portion that's about half (or less) of what I could get at TH, or any of the other places I've visited, but I suppose the "atmosphere" is what I'm paying for here?  That said, I must admit that the fried banana dessert was delicious!  Loved the toasted coconut on top (well, on top of the bananas, but under the syrup toppings, coconut ice cream, whipped topping, and maraschino cherry!).  On my next visit, when I'm craving for something sweet, I will ask to have the syrup toppings, whipped cream, and cherry omitted.  The dish is perfect w/out them.I have to say of all the Thai Restaurants that I have ever been to , and there has been a lot. This is my absolute favorite.Every time I walk in here the smell is amazing.For years we have come here,ever since It first opened.It is family owned and every thing is cooked when you order it.It is always good. In all these years I have never once not liked what I have gotten here.We even got food to go from here on New Years Eve! It too was AWESOME!Just thinking about it makes me want to eat here every day, not just Fort nightly.Bathrooms are always nice and clean. Plus lots of parking in the back.Easy to find, right on Central and right next to Durants.This is it! This still stands as my most favorite Thai Restaurant ever! I love the food here. Plus, the minute you walk in the wonderful smell of all the spices is so warm and inviting. It is cosey in here and romantic ,smells great, and has great service. So it is a win, win all the way around.Everything I have ever tried here has been delicious,but my favorite is still the Yellow Chicken Curry.Lots of parking in the back, right next door to Durant's on Central.I LalaLOVE this place!! I've been on this crazy Thai kick for a long while now and after trying so many places that were decent but not too amazing, I found this place! THIS IS MY THAI SPOT now! My friend and I decided to go here for lunch and it was pretty busy. But we were seated quickly and ready to order. We got the spring rolls (1 came with the lunch menu item) which were so delicious and crispy. For our entrees, we got the pad thai and the red curry. Both dishes were amazing. But the pad thai was our favorite, which is a big deal to us since I don't really like pad thai that much. The curry was a little spicy but it was so creamy and flavorful. The veggies were perfectly cooked and the tofu wasn't soggy. The pad thai was loaded with veggies and again the tofu was not soggy. It was such a great dish. Service was good. Our waitress was sweet and prompt. The food is inexpensive for the quality.We can't wait to come back. Oh and I love the name of this place. "The wild THAIger." Rawr! So clever.I was hoping to try the food here before I left the city. Unfortunately, I was turned away at the door, even with empty tables in sight. The hostess informed our party that the restaurant was short staffed and we would have a ten minute wait. No problem. We are patient. With no other patrons waiting to be seated, we requested to sit at a table and would have no concerns about waiting for service while we rested our legs and chatted. We were refused.In 103 degree heat, we were refused. They were unwilling to allow us to sit inside at an empty table to wait! We questioned this action and the hostess turned to the kitchen, then looked back and said she was not allowed to let us inside.We were left with the option of standing in the heat while tables remained empty inside, or we could find a place that was willing to accommodate our party. We chose the latter. I'm sorry that I will never have the opportunity to review the food here. Even more, I am disappointed that the staff behavior was so appalling. The only interaction with the restaurant that I have to review- a refusal to allow us to sit at an empty table.Diners, drive ins and dives listed this place as a MUST try do we did. k so first off let me explain why they didn't receive a 5 star. We came at 8pm on a Fri night and it wasn't too busy for a mom n pop spot. The lighting was HORRIBLE. I understand u want to set the mood outside but if customers tell you more than once that they can't read the menus then something needs to change. They lite a candle but it gave little to no help. We had to use our phones. Another thing we noticed is that the food took SSSOOOO long to come out! Also, by the time the food came out (3 plates at first and then another 10 minutes later) the food was luke warm. It seemed like they had plates ready but waited for the others to come out which made the rest of the food barely warm. Ok on the upside, the presentation of the food was great! We ordered beef pad Thai, tropical chicken fried rice, yellow chicken curry and peanut chicken plate. They were all very good, but the temperature of the food down played it. It all tastes great. We were so Hungry after our softball tourney that we didn't want to send it back since it took so long in the first place. Overall it's pretty good Thai food. Service was good as well. We Had a hard time understanding our waitress but we made it thru. If you're a local come try it.

Review Text :
I really would like to give Michelina's more than 3 stars.  The service, atmosphere, wine, and food were all pretty good.  Michelina herself even came by the table to check on us.  However, for $50 per person, I believe we deserved to be blown away!  We were satisfied, but not blown away...It was a rainy Friday night, and my boyfriend was craving Italian as was the other couple we went out with... They relied on me to choose the restaurant, so I remembered that I enjoyed Michelina's a few months back with some family that was in from out-of-town.  (Please note that I never saw the bill that last time and had no clue how expensive everything was during that visit.)  There were no Yelp reviews yet, so even more appealing, right?  I could be the first!  So, here it goes:Michelina's is hiding in a very unassuming little shopping center off of Shea and the 51.  I would guess that their business is mostly from word-of-mouth because I'd never noticed the location before my first visit nor had I heard of it!  I made a reservation to be safe, but I don't know if we really needed it or not.  Brad was our server and he was excellent.  He took drink orders and recommended 2 appetizer specials:  Eggplant rollatini and Oysters with spinach, ricotta, and bay shrimp in an alfredo sauce.  We took one of each for the table.  Brad commented that we could wait to see if we liked the apps to know if we could trust him or not.  We did trust him - we were all pleased with the appetizers even though I thought the Oysters were a bit heavy.We went with a bottle of Merlot for the table (I don't remember the name of it) and it was good - nothing special, but good.  For our entrees, I went with the escolar special - served on a bed of sauteed spinach; Jared went with the Veal Chop special served with fresh pasta shells stuffed with spinach and ricotta; Deborah took Brad's advice and ordered the Chicken Genovese special; and Jack had the Veal Saltimbocca layered with prosciutto and mozzarella cheese.  (More on entrees coming soon...)This is where the highlight of the meal came in... we were all pleasantly surprised that dinner salads came with our entrees.  There was no mention of this on the menu, so when Brad brought out the salad course, it was an added bonus!  The house dressing was delicious and the salads were basic but fresh and delicious!Back to the entrees... Jared was the most pleased with his (the Veal Chop with fresh shells) - he said it was excellent!  We all had meal envy because the rest of the entrees were kind of bleh - not Worth the $25/$30 for each of them.  Jack and Deborah mentioned after that perhaps our meals would have been better if Michelina added about a cup less salt to each of them!We opted against dessert, but the boys had some coffee/cappuccino and Brad brought us all out a complimentary apertif of amaretto, creme de menthe, and creme de cacao... I don't think any of us were interested, but it was a sweet (literally sweet) gesture.We all left feeling satisfied but not blown away... We won't be rushing back to visit Michelina anytime soon, but if money is not an issue, go check it out and let me know what you think.  Maybe your experience will be worth more than 3 stars!

Restaurant name  Tessaro's

Review Text :
The secret in their having one of the best burgers you will ever eat, is in the meat!  They add ground steak including filet mignon!  Another reason why the burger seals in all of those juices plus adds flavor is they are cooked over a 500 degree hardwood grill.Tessaro's was not hard to find, but in a run down area.  They have a parking lot on the side of the building, connected with a grocery store's lot..  The place is small, with a huge bar in the middle.  It was crowded, but we were lucky enough to get a booth.  I was a bit disappointed in their not having french fries, but I tend to fill up on them, so in a way it allowed me to finish that delicious huge burger!I hear they are known for their ribs, as well. The murals are hand painted of the owners and workers and an Irishman and his sister own the restaurant and do the cooking.  The soups are homemade as well.Servers were older and ours was friendly and helpful!  Go and have yourself one of the best burgers you will ever have in your life and add a hot homemade bowl of soup to your check, outstanding!Let me start out by saying, I share food when it's good but I DON'T share food when it's REAAAAAALY good! So I was there with a friend enjoying their fantastic potato salad and she had scarfed hers down in like 5 seconds and her fork was headed towards mine. I stabbed my fork in the same potato she had settled on and yelled NO! And just think, this is JUST the potato salad from here! The burgers are the juiciest biggest most incredible burgers ever! I stick with the cheeseburger because I want to enjoy the burger without any fancy smancy stuff on it. I literally had the first bite of the burger and the juice squirted out the other side. Ok, I know that sounds dirty...but it was SO good!! I haven't strayed much from the burgers, but I did have the tuna melt once and it was good, but nothing compares to the burgers. I mean, that's what you go there for! Plus, my friend saw Russell Crowe there while he was filming a movie in the burgh, so you have to know it's good if his peeps recommended he go there!I have to preface this review with two factors. One, I moved here from South Florida, where the best burgers in town came from your average diners.  They were the last bastion of American food in South Florida, so they served up REAL American food.  If you wanted a real burger, you went to a diner.  After returning to Pittsburgh, I found that every diner here has turned to serving up those frozen gray hockey puck patties and passing them off as burgers.Second, (until the recent explosion of good burger joints in da burgh), I actually HAD been a fan of Tessaro's, until their hostess/manager flat out offended the hell out of me and my party of three.  The result is that I have never, and WILL never return to Tessaro's.My best friend is a 62 y/o blind woman that I met doing theater in the 90's in Pittsburgh.  She lives with her 91 year old mother, and her father (the driver) passed away several years ago.  I don't drive, and rely on the bus system that Steve Bland is intentionally systematically destroying, so any outing that we make must be carefully planned.She and I had met once at Tessaro's.  It was her first time being there.  She took the Access van for the disabled, and I met her there after work via bus.  I walked in, she was seated, having a drink, waiting for me to join her. No problem.  We had a great meal, with an awesome burger.  I can't say enough...they really do have mouthwatering burgers.Months later, we decided to go again, and the plan was pretty much the same.  She took the Access van to the restaurant, and I was going to meet her by bus, and this time a new friend was going to join us, coming by bus from Oakland, and new to Pittsburgh.My best friend called me at 4:30 (we were supposed to meet at 5) and said that her van had come early, and that she was already at the restaurant.  I told her I would get there as soon as I could.  I left work a few minutes before 5 pm, and arrived at the restaurant 5:15.  They were busy, but I was surprised to find my friend still standing in the doorway.  The blind woman had been standing there for 45 minutes.  I made my presence known, and the hostess/manager acknowledged, asked about our other friend. I explained that he was ten minutes away and coming by bus, new to the city, but WAS on his way.  She walked away from us.  We stood in the doorway fro another twenty minutes.Finally, the manager came back, and I caught her attention, and motioned my head toward my blind friend, and asked if we really had to keep waiting?  She'd been standing there in the doorway for over an hour.The next statement sealed the deal on us never returning to Tessaro's.  The manager slapped her hands on her hips, and started barking:"LOOK!  We don't have many rules around here!  In fact, we only have ONE, that you don't get seated until your whole party is here!"And THIS is what really sealed it:The woman thrust her thumb in my BLIND friend's direction, who had only been to Tessaro's ONCE before in her life, with me, and said:"And SHE oughta KNOW that!"She oughta know that?  Exactly HOW should she 'know that'? The only other time she'd been there, she arrived before me, was seated, waited, and I joined her.Additionally, the 'rule' was posted...on a piece of 8 1/2 by 11 copy paper, taped to the wall at the end of the counter, behind several rows of water pitchers.  I couldn't see the 'rule'...a blind woman certainly wasn't going to 'see' it!Finally, after another ten minutes standing there, the manager 'allowed' us to take a table and wait for our friend, who came five minutes later.  We ate our meal, paid our bill, and we left.And we will NOT return.You can treat me badly, and if there's something I really love about your business, I might come back.  But do NOT badmouth a blind woman, or anyone else for that matter, who is disabled, and in need of a slight amount of extra consideration.Tessaro's, you might make good burgers, and you'll continue making a fortune off them.  And I'm sure you really don't give a crap about how your manager treated this lady.  But we will NOT drop one dime more in your restaurant.  We'll take our business to Burgatory.I know, it's a Pittsburgh institution and we're supposed to rave about it and declare it the "best in the burgh". It's not. Not even close. I've eaten there many times in the hopes that maybe I missed something. Maybe it was me. Oh but it's not. It's not me. It's just not that good. Over hyped, underperformed. Burgers are adequate - nothing special. Order something other than a burger and you don't get much better. Years ago it might have been worthy of its reputation since there weren't a lot of competitors. Now, forget it. Burgers are ubiquitous and great ones are everywhere. Best burger in the city is at Kaya - the Kaya burger. Tessaro's - a fading icon of days gone by.  Enjoy the crowds, convince yourself your getting the best, that you're in the know. You're  not.This is not only the best burger in Pittsburgh. It's also the best burger in the USA. Cooked to perfection. The home fires are off the hook too. There is other stuff on the menu but stick with the burgers. Great eats. When in Pittsburgh I will make time for a stop at Tessaro's.Tessaro's is a Pittsburgh classic, and it feels like a classic, old school place when you walk in.First, the whole "this is not the best burger in Pittsburgh" comments... it's also a lot less expensive than a lot of the burger places in Pittsburgh.  This is not the kind of place you come for a million toppings.  This is a straight up, non-fancy, large burger.  It's not trendy, and it probably never will be.Otherwise, I came here and personally ordered a whiskey sour and a cheesesteak with coleslaw.  The whiskey sour was spot on, and the alcohol content was spot on as well.  The cheesesteak was great, not particularly traditional, but great nonetheless.  The steak was tender and there was plenty of it.  Lots of cheese.  No complaints!  My parents' meals were great too!If you need some meat and friendly service in your life, Tessaro's is a great place to stop.

Review Text :
The Groovy P. and I ventured to his old stomping grounds for lunch today.  The '5 and Diner' on 16th St and Colter left me with little to ask for.  Before coming here I had a preconceived notion that 5 & Diners were dirty and nasty. Not the case at all.We walk in and let the waitress know we want to sit outside (since it's so nice and they had misters).  We get two different servers bringing us stuff (talk about service) and I ask the one waitress for recommendations.  I didn't listen to her, of course, and ordered the Southwestern Burger w/ coleslaw and started with a nice stack of rings.The Onion Rings were perfectly cooked.  They looked like they were prepackaged, but they were very crispy and I could actually bite through the onion without pulling the entire thing out (don't you hate that?!!!)The Southwestern Burger was order Medium Rare and was cooked accordingly.  Soft, juicy, and pink with a nice crispy browned outer layer that can only be achieved on a well used grill.  The creaminess of the chipotle mayo paired beautifully with the green chiles.  Unfortunately, because I ate too many onion rings, I couldn't finish my burger.  What a shame!The Coleslaw was just how I like it.  It's hard to find a really good coleslaw.  I prefer mine to be slightly sweet, not sour.  Too much vinegar in slaw ruins it in my opinion.  This slaw had the perfect marriage of mayo, vinegar, and sugar. Not to mention carrots...My experience here was great!  The servers were top notch and kept my water full the entire time and actually chatted with us for a few minutes.There is an artist guy named Ross who has been there every day for 5393 days straight. No, not an employee.  He goes there and does his art! He hasn't missed a SINGLE day!!! That's like... 15 years! So if you wanna seem to be 'in the know' ask where Ross is... They'll be able to tell you.Time for a nap!Mmmmmmmmmmmmmm........................ Just thinking about this place makes my mouth water!!! The Atmosphere just puts me in another time ... the interior/exterior.... the staffing attire... the music.... uh its great... the service is nice... they are very nice, out going and attentive... but give you your space... its perfect.... the food was awesome!!! i had a burger... OMG i couldn't even finish it, it almost felt criminal...it was sooo good! and their fries are yummy too... i have this insane obsession of eating almost everything with BBQ sauce and usually i would pass on ordering it in most places because... well it always tastes funny or really watery... but in case you looove BBQ sauce to... it was great! lol The pricing on their menu is a pricier than Denny's.... but not by much, and the shake up in our reg Dennys routine is defiantly worth it :)Mmmmmm My roommate and i showed up around 8pm.... it was pretty busy.... but we were seated right away.. and our waitress.. Barbie Doll (according to her name tag) was so nice! my roommate had a pumpkin shake... AMAZING!!!! also had the biscuits and gravy with eggs and bacon... she didn't like it all to much.. (shes a very picky eater) the B&G would have tasted better to me if they didn't put paprika over if... I had their Hound Dog... a pretty nice sized hot dog, the bun toasted... and you could add on chili, cheese or sour kraut!!! I had extra sour kraut and mustard on it! :) mmmm hit the spot... and their Fri's are sooo yummy!! and their BBQ sauce is super good too :) we both decided to have a slice of their cheesecake.... I had strawberry topping.. it was alright.. i wish they had had cherry toppings... mmm.. but this cheesecake was amazing!!!!!!!!! so creamy and a really nice sized piece ... i cannot wait to have it again!! :) Barbie Doll was very attentive and helpful... no where near annoying... at all!! i loved it... and all the other waiters that passed by were lovely as well.. all smiles.. but not the fake kinds... i liked it..

Good stuff. It's places like this that make me almost interested in moving out of sunny Southern California and into Pittsburgh. We don't have pizza like this here.I've been to back to Pittsburgh like 10 times and I've stopped by here every time.A couple cuts of cheese pizza will fill you up. Yummy,Don't order extra cheese. A normal cut will have more than enough cheese.

Review Text :
When someone says "Lets get Mexican for breakfast... there is this place on 12th street and Van Buren...." my stomach takes a dive and common sense tells me that it's probably not a very good idea, but I was in an adventurous mood and Dallas G. is normally always spot on with his restaurant choices, so I decided to give it a whirl. Um... hell yeah! La Tolteca was awesome! Any place that has a full on Mexican bakery staring you in the face when you walk in is fine by me! I was lovingly admiring the watermelon shaped cookies from afar. I will be back... my stomach said. We got up to the menu board and I was impressed with the huge selection of items they had to offer. Honestly, if you cant find something that gets the juices flowing here, you have some seriously demented taste buds. I opted for the egg and cheese burrito with pico and a side of beans and rice. I slathered on the green sauce from the salsa bar and munched away at the deliciousness as the sweat poured down my face. This was one spicy, but tasty, breakfast! D.G. got the huevos rancheros. I didn't try them, but they looked pretty damn good and he seemed to be enjoying them. He also opted for the horchatta, which I normally don't like, but was pleasantly surprised with. Another thing I really want to point out is that the people that work here are REALLY nice, even to us whities. Normally I do not get such a welcome reception, but honestly, the workers were dancing and singing to the festive tunes and even the lady at the pick up counter had a smile on her face. I planned on hitting up the bakery for that watermelon cookie, but my $6 breakfast burro, rice and beans had me FULL... so I will be back for you my little cookie.. yes... I will be back!!!"Eat when you're hungry and eat 'til you're happy"...one of the rules I live by:)One of the simpler rules, really...so much less difficult to deal with than other rules:* "Neither a borrower, nor a lender be" - sure, great advice when the economy is in the crapper, but you might want to think about levering up in boom times:)* "Do not covet thy neighbor's wife" - Hey, if I hadn't done a little coveting, the Beautiful Carin would not be my blushing bride today:)* 9.80665 m/s2 = 1G - It's not just a good idea, it's the law (probably...in this universe:)And so it came to pass that I was, in fact, hungry after my run and before I hit the driving range yesterday...one of my buddies called and suggested La Tolteca.I said "Who?"...The Toltec?But Wes seems to know his Mexican food and I seem to enjoy decent Mexican food, so off I went...to a really interesting part of town:)I guess I don't get out much...hookers ambling up and down the street at 11:30 am?...People urinating behind dumpsters in the parking lot?...The unmistakable (and appetite enhancing) aroma of ganga being smoked nearby?I don't see much of that from my deck in Old Town:)I also don't get tamales that are this good in Old Town, either...m'mmm, m'mmm good...with a great big side of atmosphere:)I chose wisely and thoroughly enjoyed my number 3...two plump, succulent and spicy beef tamales, covered with red sauce...I added a couple of little plastic cups of habanero salsa to my Styrofoam plate and headed for a table in the well muraled dining area (the murals really are nice...an artistic depiction of life on Van Buren, near La Tolteca...bright and colorful:)BTW, La Tolteca is a market and bakery, too!If you happened to want...oh, say a beer or 4 at lunch, you can swing through the market and pick up a six pack of Bud for about what you'd pay for one beer at Loco Patron...and after lunch, you can grab a cupcake on your way out for about 95 cents (about 3% of what you'd pay for a crapcake at Sprinkles:)Wes and I chatted and ate...the tamales were excellent...the company was excellent...I was charmed, by both La Tolteca itself (a sweet little outpost) and by the grittiness of this stretch of Van Buren (a street that gives us all a glimpse of how a post apocalyptic world might look).It was worth the trip, for the food, for the look into another world and for a chance to catch up with my pal:)Go during daylight hours...park in the very safe "hooker patrolled" parking lot...avert your eyes from the public urination ("ma'am...that's really not appropriate":) and have a super burrito or a couple of tamales at La Tolteca...eat 'til you're happy:)

We had a coupon at work - buy one 6", get one free.  Believe it or not, 6" is plenty for this lil girl! ;}I got the #5 sandwich, which was turkey with cheese and cranberry.  There are two different breads to choose from and two different dressings.  I had the whole wheat bread and the garlic dressing.  They have the sandwich menu split into regions of the world, which I thought was cute, though then the number selection of the sandwiches was off.  It affected my OCD, but not too much!This was one of the best sandwiches I've had in this area!  I'm in the Scottsdale Airpark and surrounded by restaurants.  Most are just trendy places that people go to, just to say they've been there.  And they suck, for the most part!So, the sandwich was ooey-gooey and delish!  I had sauce running down my arm and cheese sliding out the sides.  That's how we do it on the East Coast, yo!  Oh, and a cranberry popped out onto my "shelf" (the chest, dudes!) but didn't stain, luckily.  5-second rule, right?Anyway, with the coupon, my co-worker and I paid $3 for 6"!!!I have ordered from here on several different occasions and had the pleasure of eating at the actual restaurant once.  I usually order the #1 Madame:  ham, salami, egg, tomato, mozzarella & lettuce with extra garlic sauce on the side.  I always order the small which is 6" and $5.99.  The sandwich is actually quite large and makes me really full.  It is soooo good and tasty. I think the garlic sauce is what makes it a home run for me.  I've also ordered the Bulgoki Bowl $7.99.  It's not like complete authentic bulgoki meat like you would get in a ma/pa restaurant, but it does the job considering there aren't any Korean restaurants in the area.  Today I ordered the Albacore Tuna Salad Wrap $6.79.  And once again, I was extremely satisfied with the wrap.  The tuna was juicy and not dry and it was mixed with the garlic sauce which was fantastic.  Delivery has always been quick and the driver friendly. I definitely will continue to order from them during my lunches.

Review Text :
I suck. I've been going to this strip mall for many, many years and always thought "I need to check that place out".   I finally went and it was so simple and good I be a regular form now on I promise.Had the brochettes, all were very good. Not "oh my f'ing God" good but yet very solid.  The lentil soup was fresh and full of vegetables.I had the bolonanase (sp?) ragu.  Past with meat sauce but oh so much more when it came to the taste.  I cleaned my plate.Keep in mind this place is BYOB. You sit on plastic chairs. and there are only about 8 tables in this tiny strip mall location.Nice.I try not to throw around 5-stars out like gang signs, because I really want to reserve the primo ratings for places that really knock my socks off. But, Giuseppe's is quite deserving of the highest rating because it really is a gem of a place. Voted New Times Best of Phoenix Neighborhood Italian (2003), veal (2004) and BYOB (2005), Giuseppe's certainly has earned such accolades. However, in all fairness, I must say I do not live in the neighborhood nor did I have the veal. But, I'll most definitely be trying the veal. And since I went with Robert M, you should know that BYOB is a given. Well, honestly, since I showed up it's almost certain that I'm carrying some form of alcohol on my person. After watching a decidedly emotionally-charged movie at Camelview (The Boy in the Striped Pajamas, an amazing must-see even though a key element in the film is grossly misleading--PM me if you've seen it and I'll share) Robert M and I needed to do something to appreciate the goodness in life so we decided to devirginize ourselves of the Giuseppe's experience. It was about 4:45 p.m. on a Saturday and we were seated immediately. Tucked into a strip mall, it immediately reminded us of the set-up of Pizza A Metro. After reviewing the menu, Robert walked over to Sprouts for wine and we ordered three bruschetta (slow-cooked pork ribs with tomato & melted mozzarella, pesto &fresh tomato and chevre & marinated sun-dried tomatoes) that were all extremely delicious. The bread remained firm and not soggy, yet not so hard that it hurt your teeth or cut the roof of your mouth. We also split the lasagna which was made with fresh pasta and plated with the most divine "gravy" [for all the Italians, although I'm Irish] that we've ever tasted. So *smooth* and not bitter or acidic or sweet or anything less than heavenly. If I could bathe in this, I would. But, since I'm not a splosher... :blush: If only I wouldn't have eaten so much popcorn in the hour before going to Giuseppe's, I would have indulged in so much more. But, alas, I have found a reason to take this Avenue kid back to the Streets: Giuseppe's.Should have listened to the numerous negative reviews on-line (and there were many) but we trusted Guy from Diners, Drivins & Dives ...BIG MISTAKE. Clue #1 Strip mall with huge cheesy banner boasting "Food Network" endorsement. Clue #2  Self serves sign-in waiting list, apparently, the slimy owner was too busy gushing over customers trying to eat but steering clear of unhappy ones.  Misters and drinking water would have been a nice touch to make the 10-20min 104 degree wait more bearable. The minute we saw the paper table cloths and plastic chairs,cups & utensils we were in trouble. One waiter frantically tried to service the whole restaurant, which was a complete zoo. Now according to Triple D, the pasta was homemade....aaaaaah.....not so much.... Ive been to Italy, I know the difference.  Cut to the chase, $27.00 for two a la carte / appetizer sized entrees.Seems to me, his only goal is cashing in on the TV appearance as quickly as possible with no concern to repeat business...Don't waste your time and money....On a positive note, Guy was right about Matts Big Breakfast in downtown Phoenix, great good and the best costumer service we've ever had.Really?! Who else finds it incredibly tacky that they added "As seen on food network" on their sign? Me thinks that a visit from Guy has made your head big. I enjoyed the food here before Guy visited. Now the service is rude, the prices are sky high and the food quality is down. I have given them the benefit of the doubt and eaten here a couple of times after the Guy visit. Every time it has gotten worse. I would much rather go to La Piazza Al Forno. The meatballs were small and tasteless, the sauce was very sweet. The lasagna used to be really good here but the last 3 times it has gotten smaller and costs more and the flavor is disappearing with the portion size. Overall to pricey for what you get. Again that sign is just plain old tacky and is enough of a reason to make me go elsewhere. In my opinion a stupid move. Maybe Gordon Ramsey should visit and give Giuseppe a much needed reality check!I find these 5 star reviews to be incredibly suspicious. We just got back from returning our ***70 dollar take-out order*** (which consisted of 2 gnocchi, 1 bolognese, and 1 linguini and clam sauce, by the way) to a very rude and egotistical owner. We called beforehand to merely voice our concerns about this incredibly expensive, yet mediocre meal. The owner answered the phone and was not only unconcerned, but was very argumentative, saying that he "only gets a complaint once every 2 months" and that he has a "packed house." He made us feel like our opinions didn't matter in the least bit. He begrudgingly told us to bring our food back for a refund, so we did just that. When we arrived, he met us outside and argued with us a bit more, emphasizing that his 20 seat restaurant was full. When we tried to explain our concerns with the food, he said "whatever" and left, shortly returning with our refund.Food:-Clam and fettuccine-far too salty-Tomato sauce- tastes like canned-Gnocchi-mushy, no texture-Bolognese-no flavorBottom line:-Rude, arrogant owner-Bland,over-priced food-Never returning!!I really didn't want to have to write this review, since I live in the neighborhood and want this place to be good. Before it appeared on Food Network, although expensive, this place was quite good. I just don't want anyone else to waste their time and money when there are so many other good Italian restaurants to eat in Phoenix. (e.g. Aiello's)The food is so-so to average ....... and then it falls off the cliff .......                             The prices are OVER-THE-TOP !!!!       *This is an EGO DRIVEN Restaurant       *Signs all over the place ....... about The Food Network       If you have an yen for an OVER-RATED experience ....GO                    You won't be disappointedTucked in a small hole in a strip mall, this little place actually serves really good food! It was on DDD for a reason!  Small but with charm and a really pleasant women behind the counter for lunch, we ordered and shared a meatball sub and italian sausage with sweet peppers sub. We also started with the prosciutto and melon. The appetizer was amazing, just like I got in Italy. The sandwiches were both fantastic, I am still trying to decide which was my favorite. They had plenty of cheese and sauce and were falling apart and messy and yummy just the way a saucy italian sandwich should be!They have ice tea and a variety of soda's and italian sodas but they are in a can fyi. Tables are a little close but the food was worth at as well as the service. We did have a local dines voucher for half off the meal but the prices were really great. We really felt like we got out money's worth and would go back in a second without the coupon.  I will be back to try many more things on their menu!Well I held out on writing a review based off my 1st experience,  which was two weeks ago.  I called in a order to carry out.  I ordered shrimp fettuccine Alfredo with fig and marscopone purchtuo burchettas. When I got home it was terrible.  The pasta is home made so it's super thick.  Four small shrimp and hardly no Alfredo sauce, I mean dry. That fake bruccetta is hard and dry.  So I called a spoke to Cindy and explained that I lived far from the location.  It practically took me an hour to get there and I couldn't come back.  So she put the owner in the phone and we worked out a deal that I would get a $27.00 credit the next time I came in. Fast forward to today which was a couple of weeks later. When I arrived Cindy wasn't there but the owner Richard was.  So I explained who I was and he remembered. So he said I can give you a $17.00 credit because you ate the meal didn't you?  I didn't even touch that dry mess. So being pressured and embarrassed of what the phone conversation was and what he was saying to my face and the place was packed and I didn't want to argue.  I just ordered their signature dish, the Osso buco to- go again. So the waiter rang me up and I ended up paying them about $15.00 additional dollars.  I was pissed off. But I figured well maybe it will be worth it.I get home and make nice salads for me and my husband to accompany the meal still with high hopes because it looks good and the meat is falling off the bone. So we eat it with disappointment.  The sauce is tasteless I mean no flavor at all the bread was dry.I will never return. I will go to Olive garden which I far better than this place. Or just wait to go back to New York and eat authentic Italian at Carmine's or Rao's in Vegas. Or for great bruccettas go to Postionos.I don't know why this place is crowded.  The food is bland and it's so tiny.  I have been to several DDD destinations this one is a BIG miss.

Restaurant name  Cracker Barrel Old Country Store

Review Text :
We had a gift certificate for Crackle Barrel and so we decided to try this place. I walked in and confusion. It's a real country store with a bunch of old stuff hanging down from the ceiling. Looking for where to go then as you look at the back of the store and you see the hostess stand. Thank goodness. The place is packed and it's like a very homey country place with lots of old country pictures and plaques. I got the menu and again confusion. Huge menu for lunch and dinner with another menu for breakfast (they serve breakfast all day). So going through both menus is tough. I started out with their raspberry lemonade in a frosted mug. Really good, fresh and I loved it. I had the fried catfish with Mac & cheese, fried okra, and hash browns. Oh yea forgot to tell you, you get to pick three sides with your meal. The catfish was ok. A little dry. The mac & cheese was ok. Not great. Okra was a little moist. Not crispy like it should be and the hash browns were ok. Not a great meal but ok. Also, they bring out muffins and cornbread muffins. I've had better cornbread. Not great. So I would say my meal was just ok. My wife had the apple cider vinegar BBQ chicken. She loved it. It was very moist and the sauce was excellent. She was talking about it in the car. Haven't heard her talk about a meal like that before. I grabbed a little bit and it was very good. Loved the sauce. My son had the chicken fried steak and it was pretty good. No complaining from him. The service was good. It took awhile for our server to greet us but understandable because the place was so busy. She did get our drinks and refilled us when we needed it. She was pretty good and friendly. So the place is loud with people eating and enjoying themselves. Lots of families. There was music playing but I think it was. some country music. The food was okay to really good. I guess I just ordered the wrong thing. I did notice everyone ordering breakfast and the blueberry pancakes and French toast looked really good. So next time it's breakfast. Service was good and a real family atmosphere. Like I said I will probably be back but order from the breakfast menu. Enjoy.When I walked in, I felt like I've been here before. I never really paid attention to this before but they have a quite few locations in Arizona alone and they are everywhere in the United States. I must have went one of them somewhere in east coast.Based on the decor of the restaurant, I wanted to eat biscuits and gravy with side of grits. I was on my way to some hiking, I wanted a lot of calories. Old timer's breakfast comes with biscuits and gravy (so many of them, couldn't finish what was served), small side of grits, (thinking how grits tasted as I write my review, now I remember last time/place I went to a Cracker Barrel. Interesting how food brings back memory), hash brown casserole, and sausage patties. It all tasted how the restaurant is decorated.I also tasted fried Apple, it wasn't as sweet as I anticipated, just natural Apple sweetness, it would be perfect to use it for Apple pie. I ate two off my friend's plate but I actually wanted to eat all. Next time I will just order my own.Service was good. She was very friendly and efficient. We were there at 7am on Sunday and they weren't busy but based on how restaurant was set up (chairs outside), I bet they get really busy during peak time. How efficient she was, she looked like she's been working there for a while. I didn't feel we were rushed, she was just good at what she was doing.

If you speak Mandarin, you can request whatever Asian cuisine your heart desires.  Bliss!  Since my Chinese is about as rocky as a kindergarten students', I like to drag my parents with me.  We always order up a storm- not exactly sure how to translate the dishes ordered but I'm sure you get the point.  This is as authentic as authentic gets in Charlotte (even some of the foods on the regular menu).  Absolutely love the owner, the wait staff, and the food.Step out of your comfort zone.  That's how you'll get to experience the authentic.  Junk like sweet and sour chicken is not authentic.  Have fun!

Review Text :
3.5 stars. If you must do a chain Mexican restaurant in Phoenix, then Arriba is your place.   Don't bother with Macayo's, Ajo Al's, etc.  Sure it's not the best, but when you want full-service and don't want the uppity Barrio Cafe type of place or the counter-service La Tolteca type of place, Arriba is good for that.The servers are always friendly, the atmosphere inside is more gawdy than its busted bright Vegas jumbotron on its exterior sign on Camelback -- but is to be expected -- and the chip/salsa stand thing is righteous.  We were in there and out of there for dinner last Thursday in under 40 minutes (a measly 10 minute wait for our food) and under $30.While I sometimes order the White Sands Chimichanga adorned with a creamy white cheese sauce and a mini New Mexico state flag toothpick, the Pollo al Diablo is my favorite and features a grilled chicken breast covered with fiery Hatch chile and monterey jack cheese.  It's one of their more well known dishes and is not for novices.  I am not responsible for your indigestion or hyperventilations.  Just sayin.*pffffffft*  That's how you spell the sound of a fart.  And that's exactly what I did for 2 days this week, after my trip to Arriba.It's basic Mexican fare.  We had a group of about 12 and they were great taking care of us.  I never had to ask for my iced tea to be refilled.  The food?  We made a list at work ahead of time and ordered it right before we left the office.  I ordered the fish taco dish.  It came with a side of refried beans and rice.  The beans were nasty and then I realized they probably weren't vegetarian, so I only had a bite and put them aside.  The rice was...rice.  The only way it had any flavor was because I had doused it with hot sauce.  The fish taco?  No flavor!  The fish was grilled, but I could barely taste it.  Everything was covered in some sort of white sauce and it was all that flavorful, but still covered up any flavor that *could* be in the fish taco.  I still prefer Two Hippies.The service was great, but it was really the only thing memorable.  I doubt I'd go back there.  *pffffffffffffft*

Way to go Cards!!! My party consisted of 25 screaming Cardinal fans.( I had made reservations 3 days prior) So, when we walked in our table was readyand our waitress was standing there to take our drink order! Every aspect of our experience was spot on!!! The Nacho's were Da Bomb! We never had to wait for anything! Here is the one downfall... there are T.V.s in the Men's  room but not the woman's... what the hell.... I jokingly complained and the management said for you it will be rectified!  Gallagher's you complete me!! We will be back! And when College football starts again we will be turning this into a "buckeyes" bar!Although I love Gallagher's and this is my neighborhood standby for a quick and easy frothy adult beverage with friends, I was first leaning toward giving only four stars -- mainly because the quality of the "fresher" elements of the food (i.e. lettuce, jalapenos, etc.) is not especially consistent. But, after thinking about what I would include in my write up I decided I have to go with five stars. Here's why: *FREE cookie sundae with the purchase on an entree on Sundays (Half-baked Chocolate Chip, White Chocolate Macadamia Nut or Peanut Butter with Chocolate Chip cookie topped with 3 scoops of vanilla ice cream and chocolate syrup. You can mix it up with two and go 1/2 and 1/2!) *Build your own burger - not only can you pick your "meat" but you can pick your "bun" and your bun can be a bed of lettuce allowing for less guilt over the fries. I'm partial to the Greek Burger (topped with feta cheese, diced tomato, black olives, and a side of cucumber sauce) made with a turkey patty on a bed of lettuce. *Karaoke on Saturday nights and, if you want, you'll easily get to sing more than once! (I, however, do not sing. I'm pretty sure I could get paid NOT to sing -- even at karaoke. I like to watch and make requests!!) * Generally not a problem getting a seat and TVs are EVERYWHERE! But, when it really counts, Gallagher's graciously took a reservation for the play off game and, actually had "Reserved For..." signs on the tables. The manager was very courteous, even when some of our group were slow to arrive. For this, Gallagher's has secured its place as my "#1 go to watch a game" spot for all time. P.S. If your preference is "fake cheese" nachos, as mine is, then hands-down these are the best nachos in the Valley. (If you like real cheese on your nachos, you are on your own!!)Damn you Yelp for your no half stars~!~!!!!!!! I guess I will have to write the review and then decide between 3 and 4 after I brain dump. I have been to Gallagher's twice now. The first time for Saturday night Karaoke, and the second for the final playoff game (Go Cards!). Over the span of those two visits, I have tried quite a few items. The nachos are really, really good. They use nacho sauce versus shredded cheese, which I happen to think is pretty tasty. However, the salad I ordered left quite a bit to be desired. I kept getting the crunchy gross part of the lettuce head so only half of my salad was edible. The cookie sundae was pretty damn good, as well. I have also had the cheese crisp which I have no complaints about. Perhaps the BEST thing about this place is the $3 well drinks. I am used to paying $5-$9 for a damn vodka tonic, so I was pleasantly surprised when I paid under $10 for three drinks! Now, service here is another story. I'm sorry to say that both times it has left something to be desired. I completely understand that the place was packed on a football day, but the whole place was reserved in advance so I feel like they should have been more prepared. I had to ask for limes three times, and waited twenty minutes to get one. It also took almost forty minutes to get my damn nachos when I first showed up. Another flaw? They put bacon/chicken on my salad, even though I specifically said no meat... and had previously told the waitress I was vegetarian (when I ordered nachos). Oooooo now that I think about it... the very worst part of my experience was that we were seated near the patio, so every time someone opened the door the cigarette smoke rushed in. My eyes were watering and I was coughing the whole time. It was pretty uncomfortable, actually. Overall Gallagher's is a pretty good sports bar with relatively good food and great priced drinks, but there are definitely some service issues. Damn.... I still can't choose between a 3 and 4 .... I know I will be back ... I'm going with 3 and if I'm impressed next time, I will update :)Your basic neighborhood sports bar.  Been here a few times over the last few years and what can I say. The beer is cold, the food is basic bar food. Don't expect much and you won't be disappointed.That's it.

Let me explain to you something. I didn't know, until I moved 12 hours away from here, what a magical place Taste of India really is. I also didn't know, that when I fly into Pittsburgh, I would directly be driving from the airport to pick up take out before seeing my family. Helllooo! Here is your daughter you haven't seen in over a year, she comes reeking of curries and spices every-single-time! Can we start with the fact that the service here is spectacular?! My friends and I have been coming here for years. The owners are cute and funny and we are terrors when we are there because we bring large parties and we are so excited to order an entire table of plates.What fills our table? Booze, yes, they have beer.Bread: Chapatti (Yummy Whole Wheat Goodness!)Veggie Options:Paneer Jalferji (Cheese and Veg)Dal Sag (Lentils)Paneer Makhni (Cheese and Peas)Chana Masala (Duh)*Personal Fav: Malia Kofta (These little fried vegetable balls with creamy tomato sauce and almonds!) --Haven't found this one anywhere else as good as theirs! Ah! I am drooling thinking of it. What do they do to this freaking food? I just don't know. Go soon! Ask for spice level of 7-8 if you want to tantalize your taste-buds with some fiery food and if you would like to ship me a container of the Malia Kofta I will be more than happy to message you my address.....Oh, and my favorite date in Pittsburgh? Taste of India and dancing at Brillo Box. So iconic. So Pittsburgh.Rubbery, nearly raw, white outside, pink inside chicken in two different buffet dishes. I hope they looked at my plate to try to figure out why i simply got up and left, but in my opinion, if you are incompetent enough to put an entire serving tray of undercooked poultry out on a lukewarm steamtable, then anything I can try to explain about what was wrong, will likely fall on deaf ears anyway.

I used to love this place - I came here once every week or two for breakfast and to sit and write for an hour or two (I'm a grad student working on my thesis). The food is expensive (~$12 for two eggs, toast, bacon, coffee) and the coffee isn't great, but the atmosphere is nice and I didn't come all that often so it seemed like sort of a luxury. The staff also isn't particularly outgoing, though not downright rude... until today. Today is Sunday, and I arrived around 8am. I usually try to get there kind of early and leave before it gets busy so I'm not taking up a table. I bought a big breakfast (as described above) and sat down to work. Just over an hour later, I was approached by a middle-aged man whom I assume is the owner or manager but whom I've never seen before. He asked if I was aware of their "new policy" about Wi-Fi on Sunday mornings, and how they don't want people just hanging out using the internet when it gets crowded. (No sugar coating, that's almost verbatim what he said.) For the record, I wasn't actually using their wi-fi, I was writing. Whatever. His point was obvious. I stared at him for a few seconds because I couldn't believe that a proprietor was actually asking me, a paying customer, to leave when I had been there only an hour and in fact still had toast on my plate. He suggested it was fine for now but that when it started to get crowded I should get out. I said that if that's how they felt I would leave now, and he responded, "That's exactly how we feel." I was shocked, and still am. I have never, NEVER been treated so disrespectfully in a place of business. And I'm a regular, paying customer!! I always leave a tip! I still can't believe I was treated this way.I will no longer recommend this place, now that they've shown their true colors. If the food was exceptional I might try to swallow my pride, but it's really nothing special. There are several other breakfast/coffee shops in the area (including a Starbucks across the road) and I will be patronizing them instead from now on.

Aside for the enthusiasm that the owner has for the store that place was complete crap. I ordered spaghetti and meatballs with garlic bread and salad. the salad was bag greens and 3 cherry tomatoes with a little tiny packet of ranch.The spaghetti was overcooked in a half inch of water, the sauce had no flavor once so ever, and it came with one, smaller than a cue ball, meatball, almost flavorless meatball. more like a mush ballThe garlic bread was awesomeI also purchased a small jar of pesto recommended by the owner. I opened it just to put on my pasta because it had no flavor. I don't even think I'm going to eat the pesto as it wasn't that good either. There was what appears to be a homeless man rubbing through the trash looking for food. He was more than happy to eat my leftovers that I was unhappy with. Perhaps next time I should get a sub.The pesto was tossed out after the weekend...99 percent full.

Review Text :
The last time I ate at a Morton's was in Houston, TX, so I was very excited when BJ suggested that we dine here Saturday night. Had a 7:30 pm reservation, was greeted promptly and led to a comfy corner booth. The restaurant was very busy. Our server Georgeann was very friendly and hit it off right away with BJ. The two of them kept me entertained all night long! I don't know which one was the funniest. Well, BJ wins hands down. We pondered the wine bible for a bit, but BJ is a beer dude (they have a somewhat limited selection) and I am more of a cocktail girl. Loved the cosmopolitans there. Very delicious. We bypassed the appetizers, we both got Morton's salads, which were huge. I had a single cut filet and a crab cake, BJ also got a filet and bacon wrapped scallops. Both our steaks were very flavorful and cooked to perfection. For our sides, we shared asparagus and a loaded baked potato. We could not pass on dessert. I had to have Morton's Legendary Hot Chocolate Cake and BJ had the Key Lime Pie. The chocolate cake was amazing, I love it. So did BJ.  He ate it instead of his pie.  We got the pie to go and it was also very, very good. Great place for a special occasion. We had a wonderful evening.Morton's, was without a doubt one of the original esteemed statehouse restaurants in America, often emulated by others.  Great they were, with superb steaks, outstanding service and old club style ambiance. This was always a top place for business and special occasion dining. Now it is not as much as it was for my money and taste based on a recent visit.They are taken over by a very large mega restaurant chain corporation. Landry's, who are owners of over 35 restaurants and chains many you would be familiar with now own Morton's too. Morton's no longer has a focus on their original identity, meaning and purpose but are being changed in a modernized way. On my last visit changes were visible. Some changes and cost cutting and commercializing has begun. The menu is changed to include items which will appeal to a broader clientele. Now profits and growth are a bigger part of the strategy. Gone is the famous GM Bill. Bill was as much an institution as the restaurant he ran. Changed too seem to be the quality of the steaks. Our ribeyes were not a recognizable ribeye cut and the taste was not there as we remembered. One of three steaks came out drastically overcooked although the error was quickly remedied with a properly cooked replacement.I just hate to see the continuing commercialization of our esteemed restaurants in America.We decided to change-up our Ruth's Chris experience with another high rated steakhouse. Just like any night out to dinner we dressed up with a nice top and jeans, which happened to be the wrong style for the hostess at Morton's. After checking in with the girl at the front an unnamed judgmental man who sat us at our table made a judgmental comment "Oh jeans I see..." making both my girlfriend and I uneasy and uncomfortable about the rest of our experience. The drinks were average and the steaks were good, but not fabulous. In fairness, our waiter was very friendly, though.Unfortunately, our friendly waiter was not enough to overcome our bad initial impression.  I expected better, especially at a nice restaurant like this.When people are attempting to come into your establishment and spend over $150 on dinner, you should do whatever you can to make them feel as comfortable as possible.  Now I am sure never to return back to Morton's and I tell everyone I know about my negative experience.

***Chain Alert***This place is a chain, but it is a decent meal.  Yes, it is slightly over priced and the food isn't the greatest.  The atmosphere is a cross between Rubios and Joe's Crab Shack and the service is compareable as well.I ordered the Fried Whitefish Tacos (see pics) and I got a little chips and salsa from the salsa bar. Here's how the meal panned out:The tacos were Great!  The baja sauce was not the typical white sauce.  It looked more like "Fry Sauce" (if you're from Utah) but it tasted great.  I mixed it with a tablespoon of their Red Hot Sauce.  The beans were unmashed pintos which i prefer over everything except whole black beans. They were decent nothing great I mixed in a bit of pico de gallo to flavor them up a bit. The rice was horrid.  I hate to say it, but you know those grains of rice that aren't cooked?  The hard ones that break your teeth from the outside in? Yeah. Those were randomly encountered during consumption.  Not a pleasant experience. The portions were small but I didn't complain because the tacos were actually pretty good! They were crispy and you could tell they were battered and fried to order. Surprising!The salsa bar was mediocre.  The Red Hot sauce was more vinigarry (word?) than deliciously hot, and the Pico De Gallo was made from canned tomatoes.  The chips were so old that by the time I got to them they were broken shards of their former selves. Pity, I was looking for a good chip pig out.The service was very good.  The first waitress told me to seat myself and to come up and order at my convenience.  When I did, another waitress took my order promptly.  The wait wasn't long, it was about 5 minutes from ordering to receiving my food.  The tables were quickly cleaned and everyone seemed happy (the customers and the employees)  It was a very comfortable and pleasant setting.Overall, this restaurant has the 'Meh' effect.  I didn't hate it, but I don't think I'd be back.Constructive Criticism:1. Add some order to the ordering process.  I was a little confused on where (and when) to order2. Get rid of the stuffed animal order numbers.  Something about greasy food and fluffy animals says more of "bacteria" than it does "uniqueness"

Restaurant name  Carolina's Mexican Food

Review Text :
How have I not reviewed sweet, sweet Carolina's?This place is a dump in the best possible way.  If you've never been here, you're likely to grimace upon arrival.  Sure, the neighborhood is rough, but the real shocker is how dirty this place looks, inside and out.Why 5 stars, then?  At Carolina's, it's all about the food.  The tortillas are, as already stated, to die for.  They're soft, yet strong.  Your burrito probably won't be exploding all over itself mid-meal.I'm a huge fan of the Oaxaca Burrito, which contains generous helpings of chorizo, potato, and other delicious goodies.  The machaca is also very good.Back to the dump factor (that sounded gross, sorry).  Normally I am easily creeped out by restaurant filth, but not here.  Carolina's reminds me of Christmas Eve parties at my Nana's.  Everyone sitting at shoddy tables in a little room, eating delicious food.  The only thing missing is the mariachi.Why all the hype? I am still pondering why people rave about this place after having lunch there last week.. The location is not in the best part of town, the dining area is pretty dirty (see attached pictures) and the service sucked.We ordered a beef chimichanga, which they left in the fryer too long so it came out almost burnt and it was tiny (like 4 bites and you're done tiny).A bean and cheese burrito (good, but nothing spectacular) and a chorizo tostada, I will say the chorizo was excellent and I am glad because I had to fight for it. The place was packed when we arrived so it took us about 40 minutes to order and get our food. They call out numbers for you to pick up your order so there is this constant drone of number calling and the speaker was really loud, it was pretty annoying. To pick up your food you give them your receipt with your number on it. They gave me a bean tostada instead of a chorizo and when I took it back the guy asked me for my number to prove I ordered it.. This was the same guy I gave the ticket to when I picked it up originally. I told him this and he sighed heavily and started picking though all the receipts in the stack... A few minutes later he locates it, rolls his eyes and hands me a new tostada..The food was average and the service sub par. I won't be returning... And there are Panderias on every corner so being able to buy home made tortillas really didn't impress me that much..It's OK.  I hate to always be bitching about Mexican food in the Valley, but what can you do?  It's a disgrace.  The fact that this place appears to be some kind of Holy Grail of Mexican food here in Phoenix just seems to emphasize that point.Let's deal with the food first.  This isn't really Mexican food. It's Tex-Mex food.  That means you've got your choice of tacos, burritos, tostadas, enchiladas, chimichangas, etc.  We tried the "Oaxaca" burro (massive air quotes around the "Oaxaca" part of the name), which was just fine, but very, very small.  I mean seriously, i'ts beans, cheese, potatoes and a bit of chorizo - we're not talking ahi tuna here.  Why not give a normal sized portion?We tried the menudo which was delicious but again, a miniscule portion. And they can't even be bothered to give you a plastic bowl, so you have to eat it out of the styrofoam to go container.  I mean, for F's sake, they give me a plastic bowl at my favorite taco truck.  Still hungry, we ordered a combination plate, which was the same sort of tex-mex crap that you can get pretty much anywhere in town.  Not so great.It was all fine for what it is (I guess) but nothing that I would particularly go out of my way for, with the exception of the homemade flour tortillas, which were awesome.  I even bought some to go.  And that's about it for the food.Now as to the restaurant itself, it's actually pretty disgusting, to the point where one has to conclude that they are just showing contempt for the customers.  The place is filthy.  The bathrooms, in particular, are vile. As Tony Bourdain says, "I may not be able to look in the kitchen but I can check out the bathroom and that let's me know how much they care about the restaurant." Uh, exactly!   And the answer in Carolina's would seem to be, "not very much."  The surly and uninterested staff add to that special ambiance. We eat in lots of small ethnic restaurants and just because a place is "in the hood" doesn't mean it has to be gross.  Our favorite Salvadorean restaurant is in the hood but it's also hospital clean, which makes me pretty confident that the kitchen is also clean. Finally, the neighborhood.  LOL.  To describe this street as "in the hood" is an insult to "hoods" everywhere.  This street is one of the most blighted streets I've ever been on, anywhere.  I'm actually thinking of going back there today to do some documentary photos to send to my friends in Cambodia whose visions of America are mostly derived from CSI Miami.  Seriously, it's appalling.  The main thing I was thinking about driving away from there is that the Phoenix city government needs some kind of federal intervention.So would I eat there again?  Yeah, probably, if I was in the neighborhood.  Would I go out of my way to drive there?  No way.My time in Phoenix wasn't going to be complete without some Mexican food.  It didn't have to be "authentic," just a local's eatery.  I was already tired of the airport Mexican food, so instead of venturing straight there on my way out, I took a 20 minute detour to visit the city's top rated Mexican joint, none other than the infamous Carolina's.Ever have that uneasy feeling of "I don't know about this..." while exploring a new neighborhood?  This was exactly one of those times.  I already knew it was a dive, but I didn't know it was going to be a scene from the movies, almost as if Compton was ever smack dab in the middle of desert.  Even when we questioned our GPS directions, it never lead us astray.  Within a few minutes into a ghost town of project like homes, we found Carolina's.  There wasn't any windows, some minor graffiti, looking something like a warehouse with a bare parking lot.  The doors were painted black on an all white building, I was just waiting to open the doors to find bikers and extras from the movie From Dusk Till Dawn.Instead, I found a mix of patrons from all social classes, some waiting in line, and many sitting quietly enjoying their meal.  After a quick peak at the menu, I noticed nothing was in Spanish.  The guys behind the counter were all speaking flawless English and then I realized none of the clientele was Hispanic.  Could access to decent Mexican food be any easier?  I decided to ask the guys behind the counter for things that weren't on the menu and they jokingly retorted, "Go to Mexico, this is Carolinas."  The entire menu reminded me of the fast food Mexican joints (a la Muchas Gracias in Oregon) I've seen throughout the west coast, thought he prices weren't as dirt cheap as I had hoped but still a good deal nonetheless.Without abandon, I ordered a mix of enchiladas, tacos, tamales, and their infamous tortillas that were made in house.  In short, I did not come away disappointed.  The tamales were fresh, steaming away as I unwrapped the corn husks.  A quick cut into the masa revealed the fine starch hugging the bits of shredded chicken just perfectly and spiced with the perfect amount of salsa verde.  They were good enough for me to consider ordering a second one, but I was on a limited time frame.  The hard shelled taco was totally what I was used to back home - deep fried, packed, and super greasy - producing an unmistakable crunch without falling apart.  The enchiladas were drenched in a salsa roja sauce, meshed with a bed of frijoles and cheese.  This was greasy Mexican at it's finest, the kind where artery salvation was never part of the agenda, sinful with every bite.  A surprising thumbs up goes to their tortillas, simple yet hearty.  The tortillas con queso were undoubtedly cheesy and though nothing like the ones I've eaten in Mexico, were worth their weight in saturated fat.If I somehow warrant more visits to Phoenix, I can see myself coming out here for my greasy Mexican fix.  I still need to try their burritos, flautas, chimis, and tostadas.  If I like what I see and more importantly what I taste, I might be able to award this lil dive another whole star.This location is in the hood but I don't care. I will go anywhere for Carolina's tacos! I don't know what they do to the tacos here but they are like crack. I could eat them everyday! With rice and beans and a side of sour cream. I can't get myself to order anything else. This Mexican food joint lives up to the hype.This is in a tough part of town, but well worth it. It is near the airport so that makes it easy as well. The food is very good here and they do a booming bussiness.So everything is very fresh all day long. You can eat here or get it to go. The dining room could use a major overhaul but, I guess it adds to the look.Very little parking but, you will find some becaue, again it is worth it. You can even get Tamales to go by the Dozen. Take them home and freeze them. Yes this Italian loves Mexican food as well. The prices are super resonable. Service is hit or miss, though they do work very hard here. Since they are always so busy. All good here.Oh burrito, where art though?I haven't had a good burrito in quite a while and decided that I wanted to visit Carolina's in South Phoenix (12th st and Mohave - just south of Lincoln) . I hadn't been to Carolina's (Cave Creek and Cactus) since we moved from North Phoenix a while ago. As my first visit to their downtown location, I was quickly reminded why this is one of my favorite Mexican food spots in Phoenix. I waited in a line filled with of "out of place" business casual, police officers, and Mexican nationals alike. This isn't exactly what I would call the normal business lunch locale; you don't come here for the ambiance. The food is served on styrofoam and paper plates, and the table service doesn't exist. I definitely don't suggest taking your special lady here on a date night.With ala-cart tacos and burritos ranging from a couple $ through six or seven, this place is easy on the wallet. This is exactly what I was looking for and I savored every last bite of my Machaca (aka: beef) burrito, and taco! That was one great meal. Now I can scurry back to my mid-town office and finish up the day in style. Carolina's claims the valley's best tortillas; which can be ordered by the dozen and taken home, and you won't hear any disagreements from me. The fresh made tortillas are super thin, tasty, and never seem to break when you eat them, like many others will do.Happy Yelping Phoenix, Carolina's serves up some mean Mexican delights!So far the best Mexican food I've had in Arizona, HANDS DOWN.I've lived in Arizona for 39 years.Go, go NOW.  Stop reading this and go, NOW.If you start your order by asking for your machaca cooked to medium, egg whites only-scrambled softly, on a gluten free tortilla, half red and half green sauce but only on the side, you're not only in the wrong restaurant you're in the wrong neighborhood! This isn't the Biltmore B!+@#3$; this is Carolina's, take or leave it! I've been eating the burritos from here for years, thanks to my work. When you need to feed a hungry crew of construction guys, this is the place to order from! I finally made it over to Carolina's for the first time about a week ago. The parking lot was packed, big dog included, (waiting for his share no doubt) the line long filled with suit wearing business men, utility workers, even the Maricopa County posse knows where to go for good food. You won't wait long, the 20 plus employees make this joint roll like clockwork. Watching them roll out  dozens of tortillas, (probably thousands per day)is amazing. These tortillas are enormous and melt in your mouth like butter. They sell them at only $5.25/dozen $3.25/half, definitely worth every dime!You can't beat the burritos, great flavor and cheap at around $4. My favorite is the Machaca w/egg and the chorizo; add a little jalapenos for kick, top it with their delicious salsa and you've got a fiesta in your mouth!Step out of your neighborhood and come to Carolina's!

Well, I think I found my Mexican grilled chicken spot in AZ................I had this place bookmarked and decided to come down today. This style of chicken is my favorite and I am always on the lookout for places that cook it this way over charcoal.  I looked at some of the Yelp pictures and noticed that they had/have a promotion for Wednesdays (Buy one whole chicken, get half a chicken gratis).  I drove on down to check it out.  I walked inside, placed my order for the Wednesday special and a few minutes later, I was handed a heavy bag and was on my way.  Here is how it was.......Chicken-  Wow!  Fantastic chicken!  Reminded me of some of my SD joints.  I opened the container and there was a massive mound of chicken!  3 breasts, 3 wings (one was like a half wing), 3 thighs and 3 legs.  This pile of chicken smelled fantastic.  I bit into a wing first and was instantly comforted by the charcoal, smoky taste of the grilled chicken.  It was fantastic!  This was after a 30 minute ride in the car, too.  Still hot, still moist, and still delicious!  The legs were really large, the breasts were nice and big and even the thighs were tasty (I usually don't like or eat the thighs)!  I scarfed down almost a whole chicken and saved a few of the breasts for lunch tomorrow!Sides-  I'm doing low carb so I didn't really dive into these.  I did sample half a tortilla, a bite of rice and some of the salsa.  All 3 were delicious.  I tossed the beans (pinto beans, kind of watery) and saved the rice for my son and the salsa for later on tonight.  They also pack in 2 grilled jalapenos which were hot and spicy and a "side salad" which was a few pieces of lettuce and a tomato...random lol!The lady running the joint was very friendly and smiling the whole time.  This whole thing only cost $14.90!  Yup....on Wednesdays, less than $15 bucks gets you 12 pieces of chicken, rice, beans, tortillas and salsa.  One hell of a deal!  I am sad that starting next week, I will not have Wednesdays off any more.  If you ARE off on Wednesdays, and enjoy this type of chicken, it is well worth the drive down here!  I will be back soon enough!

Restaurant name  Farm At South Mountain

Review Text :
Trying to figure out what to have for breakfast - not really wanting the the usual hotel fare of sausage, scrambled eggs and french toast that's been sitting on a warming table. Talking with S on the phone this morning and he's on Yelp looking for unique places for me to check out that's in close proximity to my hotel. He mentions the Farm at South Mountain - it sounds intriguing, so why not? It sounds so much better than what was being offered at the hotel.The Farm at South Mountain is one of Phoenix's gems...When I first arrived, I wasn't quite sure what to make of the place.  I took a walk down the little road towards the back end of the property. Here you will find an open grassy area with shade trees and rows of picnic tables and space enough for kids to run and stretch out their legs. There's also an expansive organic garden with rows of vegetables and flowers which I understand supplies the cafes that are on site with all their fresh produce. A little further behind the garden, the Morning Glory Cafe serves breakfast, The Retreat - a place for massages, facials, Reiki and mid-wife counseling, and the Cottage - a place for local artists to display and showcase their artwork.After I had breakfast at the Morning Glory Cate (that's another review) I spent some time at the artists studio looking over the work of some very talented artists.The lunch spot is the Farm Kitchen which is located towards the entrance of the complex. By the time I walked toward the entrance, the Farm Kitchen was bustling with the lunch crowd. I didn't get lunch, but from what I could tell, everything looked fresh and yummy. I stopped in to pick up some fruit, some bakery goods and a drink while waiting for the hotel shuttle to come pick me up. The Farm at South Mountain is a great place to find respite from the hustle and bustle of the city - even for a short while.Being 72, I felt my parents tremble a bit when I said I was taking them to the "farm". Growing up in the midwest, it wasnt rare to hear "somebody bought the farm". This did not mean an uncle decided to purchase a ranch, but rather, met his maker, is now six feet under or my favorite, "he's in a better place now." That said, my folks were delighted at our Farm experience. It's always a challenge getting dad a plain sandwich in any restaurant but they were very accommodating. Mom and I both enjoyed our turkey sandwiches and the ice tea is extra good. Maybe it's brewed in the sun. That would be very farm-like, no? Now, I get the whole theme here with the picnic tables and all. Just not a big fan of it myself. That, and walking on grass. Ewww! But it's called the Farm and not the City, so no points docked for that. Really a unique Phoenix experience with a gift shop, walking trails and the smell of dirt. So hitch up your tractor and git on down to the Farm.great sandwiches and olive oil products!I can't stop coming here. From the day that I discovered this place, I'm here pretty much any chance I get for lunch.It's incredible to drive less than 10 minutes from my client's offices and find myself at a beautiful farm. I love eating at the wooden picnic tables under the trees that adorn the long grass field adjacent to the Farm's kitchen. You feel like you've left the world you were in, and gone off to simpler time and place, the kind you see in movies or read about in books. It's an incredible 30 minute vacation from work. Just be careful as the summer months approach, eating outside can take it's toll in 100 degree weather.But the Farm doesn't get a 5-star rating on ambiance alone - the food here is fantastic. Everything is about as fresh as it can be - the vegetables are crisp and vibrant, the breads are all fresh baked and incredibly delicious, and the meats are always tender and juicy.I love getting two half sandwiches (at no extra cost), and frequently will choose an old favorite and an interesting new item.My absolute favorites:Tuscan Sandwich . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $10.95Grilled herb chicken, marinated artichokes, shredded Parmesan Reggiano and Asiago, balsamic dressing, tomatoes, herb mayo and organic field greens on focacciaGrilled Chicken BLTDA Sandwich . . . . . . . . . $10.95Marinated chicken breast, crisp Meat Shop bacon, organic field greens, local Black Sphinx dates, Granny Smith apples and tomatoes with basil mayo on potato breadAnd if you're eating vegetarian (make sure to add avocado):Farm Fresh Seasonal Sandwich . . . . . . . . . . . . $10.95Local seasonal roasted vegetables, shredded Parmesan Reggiano and Asiago, hummus and organic field greens on nine-grainEvery dessert I've had here is marvelous. The chocolate cake stands out as magical (incredibly rich, yet somehow feels light enough to float on air).Go. Now.If you've been looking for the best kept secret in Phoenix, this isn't really you're place, cause it's not that much of a secret anymore. If you're looking for an urban escape into the farming community of Phoenix past, then be sure to stop in for a visit.  I've always heard good things about Morning Glory café here at the farm at south mountain for brunch on the weekends, we had a visitor in town, wanted food, was looking for an experience we've never had, one plus one equals two, so we ended up at the farm!I'm so glad we chose to dine at morning glory, the entire place is super cool. Lined in an old pecan grove, there are a handful of shops to check out, some artist studios, two or three places to eat, and the grounds are a great place to take in also. This was the perfect stop for brunch before we headed up to the top of south mountain to check out the views. For anyone in the market, this is also a wedding venue, it's a venue like none other in Phoenix - if you're looking for that. :-)Happy Yelping Phoenix, be sure to put this on your bucket list for Phoenix if you haven't been yet!I'm mortified!  I've never written a review of the Farm at South Mountain?  I'm not sure how this is even possible!I go here so often that this might actually be my favorite place in Phoenix to go for a relaxing cool/warm Saturday or Sunday afternoon in PHoenix.  In fact, I think I'm headed there momentarily.Many people write reviews for the various "businesses" at the Farm on South Mountain on the wrong Business/Venue pages.  But I guess this listing is a catch-all for everything.  Let's see if I can help people get this clear.  I really want to point that the Farm at South Mountain has several "businesses" and venues listed on Yelp.  You can go here for breakfast, lunch or dinner.  You can have your baby shower here or your 200+ person wedding and reception here.  You can hold a corporate event in "Stoned Grove" area around an outdoor pizza oven or you can have an intimate dinner under mature trees with glimmers of stars at night at Quiessence.  This place is a one stop shop for everything simple and beautiful in the out of doors.  I've written reviews for a few of the places on the farm and I will let those reviews speak for themselves.  I've posted pics too... One of the things that the Yelping community might appreciate knowing is that you should visit their website for special events.  Sometimes, they have special Farm dinners.  Sometimes there's a special holiday dinner or lunch.  For instance, I know for Valentine weekend, they have Valentine Dinners and Picnic lunches.  Here are my reviews of places on the farm:Maya's Farm (At the end of the Farm Drive and directly North.)Organic Certified Farm.  See them at the Farm on Sunday mornings.  Phoenix Public Market on Saturdays and also get on their CSA)-http://www.yelp.com/biz/mayas-farm-phoenix#hrid:5dPGtdn4SQIClbJ_uIe1zwSucculentia (it is in the green house on the north side of the farm, back by Maya's garden House)http://www.yelp.com/biz/succulentia-phoenix#hrid:Z91CIQ4jVqF9RG3HrRe22wThe Farm Kitchen (Lunch/Brunch and is the closest to the Picnic Tables.  you see it immediately as you enter the farm, north of  "The Farm Driveway".)http://www.yelp.com/biz/the-farm-kitchen-phoenix#hrid:7w3mgerwC9Yqd_b1amkDjA/src:selfMorning Glory (Breakfast only, but the patio is a nice place to rent for an event.  Go All the way to the end of the Farm Drive and YOu'll find it.)http://www.yelp.com/biz/morning-glory-cafe-phoenix#hrid:yzI8RxBsNlKndP1HMQ0Q6AThere are a few other businesses on the Farm listed on YelpWeddings:(I am sure there was a wedding listing on Yelp for the FASM because I used to check in to it accidentally when I first started Yelping.  If I find it, I will update)Quiessence (I haven't written a reveiw of this either.  SMH!!):http://www.yelp.com/biz/quiessence-restaurant-phoenixBotanica (Been here once, but no review)http://www.yelp.com/biz/botanica-phoenix-3This is a great place to visit after you've completed a Hike on South Mountain too.  Enjoy.  Thank me later.I recently took a friend who was visiting from Chicago here and he looked around and said, "I thought you guys only had desert and cactus".  Well, that's the usual stereotype but no, we have a lot of farms; you should have seen the look on his face when I pointed out some of the cotton fields in the south and east valley!.As others have said, this is just a gem of a place. I just can't think of a more peaceful place to enjoy a meal.  My go-to spot is the Morning Glory Cafe. Good coffee, fresh-pressed juice from local citrus and the huevos rancheros are delicious.  After eating I like to walk through the pecan trees and check out the garden plots.Nice, relaxing spot. Great way to start the day.

Review Text :
The best Chipotle is located on Detroit Road in Lakewood, OH. Sorry, I know it's a drive, but it's the truth. However, right now this is the closest Chipotle to my place so I'll review it. But this review is for Chipotle as a chain, not this particular location. If I were to review a specific location, I would review the one in Lakewood, OH because it is the best one.Chipotle is really really good. I love the burrito assembly line. I love that they aren't stingy with...anything. At least with me they aren't. I think they may pick up on the subtle "BITCH I WILL CUT YOU" look in my eye if they even hint at putting the spoon down after only one scoop of chicken.  Either way, it's awesome.It's in that weird "fast food atmosphere without fast food pricing" quadrant of the restaurant world, which I normally don't like but with Chipotle it's acceptable because you are getting a burrito the size of a baby for about $7.  Woulda given it 5 stars, but the one in Lakewood, OH is better.

Restaurant name  Olive Or Twist

Review Text :
I stopped by Olive or Twist for a couple of drinks with my friend and fellow Yelper Carrie W. after seeing The Nutcracker at the Benedum last Fri.  When Carrie suggested that we grab some drinks, I suggested that we go to Olive or Twist because I'd been wanting to check it out for awhile. I rarely receive the opportunity to go out for drinks after shows because some of my friends who I attend shows with tire out early (lame) or don't really go to bars ever (even lamer), so I was excited to finally have the opportunity to imbibe a few in a classy setting downtown.Given that it was my birthday, I knew exactly what I wanted drink-wise, thanks to Rachel C.'s review: the cake batter martini!  Thanks to other reviews, I was aware that O or T's specialty martinis are dessert-y drinks rather than your typical martini.  This was absolutely fine by me, since I enjoy sweeter digestifs later at night.  As can be seen from my photo, this martini comes with a rim of chocolate syrup spangled with multicolored decorative sprinkles, which made for a very festive--and delicious--birthday drink.  Once I finished it, I went for a second round and chose the mint chocolate martini, which also came adorned with chocolate syrup.  It tasted exactly like melted mint ice cream--my favorite kind.  Yum!We sat at the upstairs side bar, and service from the bartenders was generally good--one of them even wished me happy birthday when I mentioned why I was ordering the cake batter martini.  While it was busy, it wasn't so crowded as to feel claustrophobic.  The noise level was a bit on the loud side--but then again, what bar isn't?I really enjoyed my visit to O or T, and look forward to returning again, once I can convince my friends to stop by for a drink.  I'd love to check out the happy hour, in particular.  Because I haven't tried the regular (non-specialty) drinks or the food, I'm going with a 4, but I'll update my review once I return and do so.This was our second visit to Olive or Twist.  We came over this past summer for food and cocktails, but this last visit was just for the booze to have a celebratory drink with Laura M on her Birthday after seeing a great Ballet at the Benedum.  I don't mind O&T layout.  It's a bit chopped up but very Pittsburghese reminiscent of most establishments.  There is the upstairs where you can sit by the roaring fire on the 72" flat screen or lounge on many of the couches or loveseats they have available.  There is also the downstairs that seems to have similar offerings, however at least in our experiences was a lot busier than upstairs.  I pick less busy almost every time. This time around we found three bar seats available upstairs and settled down for a couple drinks.  I started with a Southern Tier XXX IPA, solid start to the evening.  I know they specialize in Martinis but I specialize in craft beer.  After that I decided to try a martini, I went with an Espresso Manhattan Martini.  This was defreakinlishious... I love coffee and I love manhattans so the two went together like peas and carrots.  Our service was mixed.  Some bartenders seemed more helpful and interested in waiting on us than others.  This was also my experience from last time.  This time we didn't order food though we were pretty hungry and went elsewhere to eat.  Our last meal here was not worth duplicating.  We both had an Olive or Twist Burger, and I chose sweet potato fries and requested a med rare cook.  We used the Yelp deal so it wasn't as expensive as it could have been, but the burger sells for $13.00.  I rarely complain about cost especially if it is good, however it really was not.  The meat was way overcooked and dry.  Surprisingly the fries were the best thing on the plate.  To spend that on a burger I do expect a better quality.  So lesson learned, we had some tasty drinks here last weekend, but ate at a neighboring facility afterwards.  I'm sure we will be back for drinks again.

Restaurant name  Oregano's Pizza Bistro

Review Text :
Oregano's Shmeragono's... the juggernaut Italian restaurant chain in Phoenix has people waiting in line seven days a week. Must be amazing?! Must be soooo tastey?! Must have fantastic service and ambience?! No. No. And no. Most of the staff is definitely professional, speedy and fun. My take out gal the other day "scolded" me for arriving too early. "I said 25 minutes...whyd you get here too early?""To spend time with you, you prickly ass pear"Anyway I hung out and waited my full alloted time. No biggie. I ordered 3 apps and 1 medium pizza. "That'll be $47 dollars please." says miss prickly ass pear.I  arrive home to my $22 medium BBQ pizza. Thin crust. Nice sauce. Tastey all around. The stuffed mushrooms. Not so great. More salt then Salt Lake City. And at least a pound of crumbled Italian sausage. Portabellos were too slimy. Like bad canned fruit. Garlic cheese bread...well, come on how can you screw that up. My dog can make garlice bread (and it's not bad by the way). All in all. I'd rather get take out than sit inside at this location. Not a big fan of the cluttered look. There are pictures and knick knack crap everywhere. It looks like an Italian flea market threw up everywhere!Oregano's is home to the Great Dessert War of '02. The skirmish began when the then named Bazookie was placed on the dinner table. The Bazookie as describe by the menu is "a 1/2 pound of Chocolate Chip dough, slightly baked in a 6-inch pizza pan then topped with 3 scoops of vanilla bean ice cream." Things started out with the appropriate amount of consideration for the other diner til the first bite was consumed. A fire was noticed in each others eye. Utensils soon became weapons. Ground was won and lost. The battleground was a deep dish pizza pie pan that was spun numerous times in order to gain advantage for the best and perfect bite. Spoon fulls of warm cookie dough were knocked down back onto the table to be taken away... It turned ugly quick. No offers of sharing or giving the last bite. It was fought for tooth and nail. The dessert was THAT GOOD. I would go back to Phoenix for this dish alone. And the pizza? It is a pizza joint, but that's not what we talk about or remember. The pizza was good, but not on the level of the dessert. Freshly baked chocolate chip cookie dough and vanilla ice cream!!!! What more do you people need???A man came over to my house last night with a bag of food.  Luckily, I knew he was coming.  OK, it was a "dinner and a movie" date and he brought a huge bag from Oregano's.  As I started to get out plates and silverware, he mentioned that paper plates, plastic utensils and napkins were in the bag.  Well, he sprung for dinner, I can clean a few plates, right?  HUGE portions!  He brought spaghetti with marinara.  It was angel hair.  I think there *could* have been more sauce.  The lasagna was their "Italian Flag" lasagna and really good!  Ooey-gooey with sausage and meatballs stuffed inside.  The portion was enormous as well.  We both had a hunk and I had another one today for lunch.  Both entrees had different kinds of garlic bread included in the container.  The appetizer was something I'd never had before: Toasted Ravioli.  WTF???  Handmade ravioli, stuffed and fried with a side of marinara sauce to dip them in.  There was definitely some kick to it, as they were stuffed with cheese and jalapenos.It was a very satisfying meal and I'm giving it three stars.  The portions were big, the prices were reasonable (looking at the website since he brought it to my place) and everything was full of flavor.    This was no Harley's meal, but for something quick and Italian, it wasn't half bad!  Of course, eating a meal on the couch with a cute guy will always be a plus!As a pizza savant, I am severely limited by both nature and nurture:)I have been to the pinnacle (Bianco's Pizzeria)...a couple of times, in fact...and found it unfulfilling:(I have looked into the pizza abyss (Chuck E Cheese or Totino's Frozen...too close to call), and come away scarred but stronger.I suppose some of it is nurture...the cattle ranch was a hard place to grow up and I did not eat pizza until I left home at 15 for college...Shakey's in Corvallis, OR:)Losing my pizza virginity was a revelation and a delight:)...I was forever altered...forever better:)And there is, no doubt, some nature involved...I can only think of 2 things that I can't eat and neither one involves pizza of any sort:)And that brings me to today...I will at least try anybody's pizza pie:)Some are better than others, but very few are truly bad:)So when the Beautiful Carin and I wandered over to Oregano's the other night, it was with the anticipation of a pretty good pizza and a pleasant atmosphere to enjoy it in:)We were not disappointed:)The entirely reasonable 20 minute wait went by quickly with free pizza slices to nibble and frequent refills for our drinks, while we sat comfortably and listened to the music:)When we got our table...outside, under the mist...our server was friendly, attentive and knowledgeable...but we already knew what we wanted:)It's all pretty good at Oregano's:)This time we had a deep dish pepperoni, sausage, mushroom and olive pie, along with a Mrs. Gibbilini's spinach salad...way too much for 2 people but the leftovers are great for lunches and dinner for 2 more days:)We've had the thin crust, the Chicago style, sandwiches, and salad...even the wings, on occasion:)The pies are well designed, well prepared, customizable and tasty!The sauce isn't too sweet, the cheeses selected for the pies complement the sauce and the crusts are well made and have great "tooth"...the right mix of crunchy vs. chewy:)I've seen the debates...oh yes, I read the reviews..."Chicago pies rock"..."New York is the only real pizza"...yada, yada, yada:)Well, I am waiting for a pizza to rock my world the way that first slice of Shakey's pepperoni did, all those years ago...it may not ever happen...they say you never forget your first time:)But Oregano's always serves up a good pie (regardless of whether I'm in the mood for Chicago, Thin crust, deep dish or whatever...along with all the accompaniments and alternatives I could ask for:)Does Oregano's rock my world?...No, only the Beautiful Carin does that these days, but they do bake up a pretty decent pie:)Wow, so the food here is pretty good, but the wait is silly.  I mean it, silly.  We ordered a pizza and the waiter immediately asked us if we knew it was at least 45 minutes for a thin crust and an hour for a deep dish?  Huh?  What in the name of God takes that long to assemble a pizza?  I can *almost* understand the long wait on a deep dish simply because of the cooking time, almost.  But 45 minutes for a thin crust (we're talking a crust so thin it's almost like a huge circular Saltine cracker) is friggen ridiculous.  Sorry, Oregano's, but that is just too long.So rant about the ridiculous wait time aside, the food here is actually pretty good, and they can make a side of calamari like nobody's business.  It's delicious.  My toddler and I mowed through a serving of calamari and had enough to take home to snack on the next night.  I also had a mojito and it was very good, crisp, refreshing and yummy.  And as far as the pizza goes it was very good, and my husband throughly enjoyed it.  It was just the right amount of cheese and the crust was perfect.  Good pizza, awful wait.   Like my last sit-down dining experience this waiter also somehow managed to completely ignore the presense of my toddler and I finally had to ask him to get us a cup of water for her.  Rant Alert!  I seriously do NOT understand why wait staff ignore the babies and small children of paying patrons.  Yes, it's true that my two year old won't be tipping you, or placing a food order, or even mentioning her experience on Yelp, but her mommy sure as hell will, so at least acknowledge that when you take drink orders every living, breathing human being at the table probably needs their own beverage and may need to order their own food too. Knowing the wait on the pizza I got clever and called over our waiter and asked him to put in an order for a pizzokie (sp?) for us, to go.  I explained that I couldn't make my toddler behave much longer and he graciously told me that he didn't mind noisy babies, which was great, except I bet all the patrons around us WOULD mind it if my daughter decided she was done being nice and was ready to start banging the salt shaker on the table while bellowing out 'Twinkle Twinkle Little Star' at the stop of her tiny lungs.  ;)  So after some puzzlement at my (apparently odd) request to take dessert to go he finally got it sorted out and we were able to pay and leave with our delicious dessert before the impending meltdown.So all in all this was a nice visit, but that wait time on the pizza needs to be shortened.  Seriously!TALE OF TWO TRIPSDuring our lengthy stay in PDX one of The Nines Portland (Starwood Hotel) concierge encouraged us as a must try to visit this particular Oregano's Pizza Bistro. He said the pepperoni thin pizza, rigatoni and salad were his very favorite.On our first Sunday evening in Phoenix, we make it priority to have dinner here. He did warn us that it's a very busy place.  So we arrived after 8pm and coincidentally parked right in front of the "welcome" sign. Again the parking gods were looking after us. If's most unusual for us to be offered water while waiting outdoors for our table. As it turns out we eventually get seated outdoor at a bar table for two. This is where we meet our server Lucas along with his manager Jonny (yes, it's not a misspelling).Told them that our PDX hotel concierge had been touting about their entrees. We proceeded to order the following mindful that we're intentionally over ordering and that the servings are huge in portions:- Jr Pablo Picasso Salad- Big Rig Pasta adding two meatballs to this rigatoni dish- Numero One-0 12" thin crust pizzaI think we had to be careful not to attempt to finish everything that was in front of us. It was all very very good. As a welcome to Phoenix gesture, Jonny treated us to their Pizza Cookie Chocolate Chip with chocolate mint Ice cream. By the time we were ready to hit the bed, it was very close to closing time.Note:  The pizza didn't make it past bedtime.  In the meanwhile it was salad and Big Rig for lunch the next day.  My classmates keep looking me as if I was a meal on wheels.OTHER TRIPDidn't know that our class would run so late that it eliminated many of our restaurants we had listed that closed at 8pm and 9pm.  Intentionally we keep a number of them along the 16th Street corridor.So Yu-go chauffeur says let's go back to Oregano's and say hi to Jonny and Lucas.  This time we're seated indoors where its quite cool with all the red and green.  Asked Jonny to recommend something other than what we had tried previously.  This time we're more conscious of portions.- Junior sized Beefstro Salad that's spicy- Clark Street Meat 12" thin crust pizza- Pizza Cookie Chocolate Chip with two different flavors of ice cream (told Jonny that we would buy our dessert this time. He still comped us)When it was all said and done, there was nothing to take back to the hotel.MANGA TALEThe pizza crust is flat bread thin and crispy so that we didn't feel like we were filling up with pizza dough.. Perhaps I would instruct them to cook it for a few seconds longer just to ensure that the crust remained crispy throughout our eating experience. Our personal preference would be the Clark Street Meat and Big Rig Pasta.  Both salads finished tied.A very big thanks to "Aire-Bear" of PDX for this wonderful experience. BTW his favorite is the Big Rig.I've never truly understood the Oregano's allure. It's a chain with the same menu and products in every location. There is always a wait for tables and rarely a seat at the bar. This is good for them but not for me. I find their food average at best. The pizza is great, but everything else on the menu is subpar. I ordered the salad yesterday and it was the ass end of a head of romain (you know all the yellow bits no one wants to eat) with a few soggy croutons and cucumbers. I ate less that a ¼ of it. I also got the meatballs that were doused in cheese to make up for their dryness but they weren't fooling anyone. Our server was great and they do have a nice patio but with so many great authentic locations in Phoenix I doubt I will be back.Decided to take some of my hippie friends here and treat them to some Real Big Salads. They live nearby and had not been here before. Plus a little fiber never killed anyone ... right?I've always liked this particular pizza chain and this location is just like the others. They have all the similar do-dads hanging on the walls and the menu is gigantic.Ordered my favorite Rib Eye Salad in the biggest size they have. They call it The Big Beefstro Salad on the menu and it is really good. The dressing has a sweet Serrano Pepper flavor going on and it is pretty spicy. This one was so big I had to bring some home for later.My friends ordered the Pablo Picasso Mexico Salad and it was giant. They also were excited about the size and had to ask for a box for the leftovers as well.Service was very friendly and we experienced several greetings. They even opened the doors as we both entered and left the building. We were surprised by the large amount of take out orders that were waiting for people to pick them up.Looking forward to trying out some pizza again and possibly checking out their famous all Original Pizza Cookie with Ice Cream. Dang it looked scrumptious and would definitely ruin my girlish figure. MAMA MIA!4 STARSSo, I was dining at Oregano's with a couple of love birds and finally I got fed up with the pda's. Before I could stop myself I climbed on top of the table and drenched them with my ice water. "Can I enjoy my dinner please? Either cool it, or get a room. I came to review the food, not your french kissing."I came back to reality just as appetizers arrived. I would never do that or say that to friends...or would I?  Anyway, just like Donald Trump, Oregano's does everything real BIG so we honestly didn't need to order all this food, but none of us counts calories. That's so 90's.Here are my thoughts:  Four stars for the overly friendly staff and thin crust pizza. pizzaNot a fan of pan pizza or stuffed pizza. Oregano's really does 'em up, but looks aren't everything. I choose thin crust every time. Yummy.  Simple. Easy to eat. The thicker pies turn into cheesy messes and turn me off.  I get reminded of strings of spittle when the cheese pulls apart. I realize how this can be a turn on for some food whores, but not me.   bruschetta Please tell me what the big deal is. Anyone? It's bread, with stuff on top - but it's not pizza. If that's your thing, fine, but why do you think you fancy, huh? Oregano's bruschetta just looked sloppy. Big and sloppy. It literally looked like a mound of tomatoes with cheese and basil and some bread sticking out.guaca-tonyHow do you say delicious, d-lovely, D-lectable, d-vine? How do you say D-gorgeous? D-lite? Guacamole was seasoned with basil, garlic, onions, and tomatoes. It was good, but I wish folks would stop putting tomatoes in guac.  The flavor gets watered down. What helped kick up the mildness were the accompanied cheesy salty pizza pie crust dipping slices. Good combination.yam fries/sweet po'sYum yum piggy! Comes with aioli and sweet seasoning sprinkled on - which I could totally do without. Leave the natural sweetest alone. salad On a good day, crispy romaine lettuce is usually a sign of a good salad. But my first bite of Oregano's salad left me with the taste of bag/packaging in my mouth. It wasn't overpowering enough to stop eating, but a disappointment is just that. I regretted not requesting spinach in place of romaine.BEGIN SIDE NOTEBest salad at Oregano's: the delicious spinach salad with red onions, marinated portobello shrooms, roasted red bell pepper, and avocado dressing. But that's just a memory now. This salad was removed from the menu. Whose dumb idea was that?END SIDE NOTEVeggie Wedgie sandwich.  Skip it. The foccacia bread is way too thick to even enjoy the flavor of the eggplant, portobellos, spinach, and tomatoes. It's served with red pepper aioli and for some reason I had the idea in my brain this should be spicy. It was not and fell flat.scampiThe love birdies thought the scampi was delicious. I can only give their opinions because I won't eat pasta, or paste noodles as I call them. Lady is a Scampi is shrimp with corkscrew pasta in chipotle sauce, tomatoes, cilantro, cheese, and garlic. The spicier version called El Diablo Shrimp Pasta is in chipotle cream sauce with fettuccine, cheese, and pico de gallo.pizza cookieThe only dessert they serve. It's warm and topped with ice cream, but way sweet and a little raw. If that's how you go down on your cookies, go 'head playa! (Not playa as in the beach, playa as in play-er.)

Review Text :
With its scarred wood tables, friendly staff, blaring sports games, and dim lighting, Murphy's is a local institution.  It's also where history graduate students tend to congregate once a week, huzzah.  The beer/food specials are generally fantastic, and the grimy feel of the bar is palatable after a drink or two.  One caveat: they have the nastiest--nastiest bathroom.  It's hideous.  Ugh.

Review Text :
Another great Italian find!My BF and I went to Roma Garden for dinner last night because he was given a gift certificate there from a friend.  We'd never heard of it, but we're always up for trying something new, especially with $50 towards our meal.  We pulled up to their strip mall location without expectations and we were both pleasantly surprised!When you walk in, the lighting and decor are welcoming and the staff is friendly and attentive.  It was a Thursday night and there were plenty of other guests in the restaurant, and there was a lively energy in the air.  After browsing the menu, I ordered one of the few 'Chef's Specials' of the night - tilapia with fresh veggies and pasta in a lemon caper sauce.  BF went with Pollo Parmagiana.  He had a glass of cabernet and I had pinot grigio... and voila - a warm bread basket arrived on our table at just the right time!We were both happy with our orders when they arrived as well... the fish was cooked just right and the sauce was tasty... good portions as well!  Although we were full, we decided to order a dessert to share - the homemade snow white chocolate tartufo - yum!  The perfect sweet ending to our meal.  In addition, we were each brought an after dinner drink of amaretto on the rocks, on the house.****I just have to share that I was pleasantly surprised that the women's restroom was clean, spacious, and had a fresh fragrance to it - I normally don't notice that, but I was impressed by this!In speaking to the waiter and the owner, we learned that this restaurant recently changed locations but they've been in business for over 15 years.  Gotta love the local businesses that last in the valley... we'll be back to support Roma Garden and enjoy their fine "Northern Italian Cuisine" without a doubt.  I suggest you go check it out also - bon appetito!V-Day 2013, destination: Roma Garden Ristorante! Here is the synopsis:~Fud/Drink~Fiance got the Fettuccine Alfredo with chicken and asparagus. It tasted well and had the flavors just right, the sauces were just a tad bland and oily. I got the Linguini Pescatore with mussels, shrimp and other fresh seafood mixed in a white wine sauce. I see a common theme with the flavors not being too exciting for other diners, which is a shame. Traditional cooking does assume that the flavors aren't supposed to overwhelm the entirety of the dish. If the flavors to you are bland, then I might suggest a place that over-emphasizes sauces, like the Olive Garden. I do agree, the white wine sauce was a less flavorful as others in the past, but I hate tasting the butter in the sauce, its a big turn-off in a dish. You have to  consider you are paying for the seafood, not the sauce...By the way, the seafood tasted fresh as it could be, the mussels  were especially fresh and flavorful. The shrimp also had the flavor you would expect from an animal living in the sea. The seafood was executed flawlessly, thus improving the pasta dish exponentially. The linguini was also cooked perfectly. The wines we shared were paired perfectly for our dishes, and although expensive, really tied the flavors of our dishes together.Honestly, if you come here, get something that is special. If you get a simple marinara, spaghetti and meatball dish....just why bother? MAKE IT AT HOME, Lazy. Come here to enjoy something that is difficult to execute...that's why you eat out at a nice establishment in the first place. I hate seeing people complain that they can make it at home...Go home and let me try your outstanding dish, I can't wait to try it Emeril! **That sounds just like something Gordon Ramsey would say, with a few "stupid donkey's" mixed in.** ~Atmosphere/Service~Romantic...is what comes to mind, of course. Its a nice little spot with a cute little room for service, the tables are done up nice. No music is piped in, its a relaxing and calm atmosphere. The bar room area up front is done just right, its not too large/small or pushes into the main room ruining the vibes. High tops are available to sit at as well as a bar to walk up to. Our waitress Jen knew all the specials and did not rush through them on a busy V-Day night. Instead she took time to go over all the options and the wine selection. She provided us the best service I have had in a while from a server. She consistently would come up at the perfect time to check in on us, and she was so personable and friendly. When I mentioned the 10% check in offer (which i was unaware of until I checked in), she immediately gave me the discount with a smile. She received a big tip, she deserved it for making our night even more special. Also the busser was a gentleman, he quietly helped put grated cheese/pepper on our dishes and without us asking put our food in our to-go boxes. The service is excellent.~Extras/Rating~On an excellent note, you get 10% OFF IF YOU CHECK IN ON YELP! YAY! That 10% went right back to our awesome waitress, who got a good tip, haha. We also got a free Amaretto in a glass at the end of the night, really great touch to a wonderful dinner! This is a 4.5 out of 5 in my book, but I will knock it down to 4 stars because of the semi-bland sauce...But its a solid restaurant, instantly my personal favorite family-owned Italian spot. Jen once again was amazing, see if you can get her as your server. I highly recommend this spot!!

Nuh uh. Nope. No no no. My daughter wanted to eat here for her birthday this year, having eaten at the one downtown successfully 4 years ago. Her birthday, her pick. Plus, she delights in the free mug of soda and balloon. She's a birthday sell-out and I think that must be how they suck you in. But, I digress. Our order took an aggravatingly long time to arrive and our glasses remained empty after having drunk their contents while waiting. There was a Packers game on and many of the wait staff were watching that. I don't know if that was the hold up, but it was a bit irritating. When our meals finally arrived, my children discovered that the insides of their burgers were very pink. Waaaaay too pink for medium well, which they ordered. It was scary pink and super soft--like raw hamburger generally is. When I told our waiter about it, he was completely uninterested in helping fix the situation, and instead, argued with me about it for quite a while, finally saying, "That's what medium well looks like" in a tone that suggested that I was simply too stupid to know the difference. I'm not. Finally I convinced him to humor me and take them back to be cooked through. He did so with a smidgen of contempt.As a side-note, my husband's burger was to be well done and was also pink, though not raw.Still no drink refills.No one offered a discount, a refund, a free soda while we waited, and especially not an apology. Obviously we won't be back.

Hands down, my favorite restaurant of all time.  My grandparents have been going to Avanti since the 70's!  It does have a mobster vibe and I think I have actually seen mob activity there before, but that is what makes it unique. The service is impeccable and I have never had a bad meal. They have the best gnocchi I have ever put into my mouth, it is served in a pasta trio with other pastas of the day.  Another tasty dish is the osso bucco.  You really should try this place at least once.  It would be great for a nice date.  I don't think that they strictly enforce a dress code, but you'll want to dress up a little- not a baseball hat and jeans type of place. Also, you'll want to make a reservation.Based on a recommendation from a friend, we've dined here a few times.  This Italian joint reminds me of the Peppermill Restaurant in Vegas.  The dining room walls are covered in mirrors and the furniture is black and white.  It's dimly lit and has an intimate feel to it.  During our visits, we've had the following menu items:Escargots, $11.50Mozzarella Caprese, $12.00Spaghetti w/Meatballs & Sausage, $19.50http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/avanti-restaurant-of-distinction-phoenix?select=g6rybW0TkoO10ItXCbJDyg#g6rybW0TkoO10ItXCbJDygTortellini, Lasagna, Gnocchi (custom made sampler appetizer)http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/avanti-restaurant-of-distinction-phoenix?select=OnKBcxrDWW269Z9ZAQ0hRg#OnKBcxrDWW269Z9ZAQ0hRgTiramisuhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/avanti-restaurant-of-distinction-phoenix?select=BzrmZfblwrBYIB0-5JpAKw#BzrmZfblwrBYIB0-5JpAKwThe best part about our experience here is the service.  On one of our visits, when we asked the server if they had Gnocchi, he said "We don't have it as a separate dish, but we can make something for you".  The Better Half ordered a plate for dinner that evening.  On another visit, the server noticed that I was on the fence between the Lasagna, Gnocchi, and Tortellini....so he brought out a small sampler plate for me so I could try all 3 before I made my decision....awesome!As far as the food, it's pretty good.  My fav's are the Gnocchi, Tortellini, and the Spaghetti.  You can't go wrong with any of them.Return Factor - 87%Highly recommended Avanti was my choice for dinner while visiting Phoenix. Avanti is located in suburban Phoenix so it would definitely have to be a recommend. I don't know how else you would find this place. In any case, parking is plentiful. You walk into a "mid 50-60" decor with red walls and dim lighting. Servers are dressed in suits. White table cloth, complete table setting, sexy in its own way.Short menu (that is a plus) Short wine list (another plus) and a good selection of wines by the glass. The food wash acceptable. The osso bucco was tasty but could have been done a tinge more. I like it when the marrow is like a gel... Truthfully, went there for the gnocchi which was okay.there were several sauces you could choose from to lather the gnocchi. I chose a cream sauce... Sauce was too thick for my liking, which IMHO took away from the texture of the gnocchi itself.I would go back though...atmosphere nice, servers nice...  Repeat performance do-ableOk, so this was the first review I ever wrote on Yelp. This restaurant was the whole reason I even joined Yelp. It has and will always be my favorite restaurant in the valley. You may not get it, but that's because you probably suck. First off, this place is totally dated. It's dated because that's part of it's charm. This was the place to dine back in the 80's and early 90's. My grandfather only ate at 3 restaurants in the valley back then: Avanti, El Chorro on Lincoln, and Don & Charlie's. He liked being treated well and these places never missed a beat. Of course, times change, but this is why I will always love this restaurant. It has been consistently good my whole life. Also, it should be noted, if you treat your waiters well, they treat you well. Gramps was a big tipper and he got treated very well. When he made a reservation, he made it with the same waiter, for like 20 years. Ok, maybe not that long, but long enough that he saw my mom through two marriages and several relationships. Well, maybe 20 years isn't off the mark? His drink of choice, vodka on the rocks with anchovy stuffed olives, would be sitting at his table waiting by the time we sat down. Not many restaurants can pull that off. So yeah, I am probably biased. But I am biased because I have had some great times in this place over the years. To this day, I never order gnocchi anywhere else. It's always a disappointment. It's true, though, the vibe isn't the same as it once was. For one, nobody knows how to dine anymore. Dinner used to be an event. You ordered at least two rounds of drinks before you even considered ordering food. How are you supposed to get a buzz on otherwise? Then you would order some apps/starters, then a main course, then dessert and after dinner drinks. This is the kind of place you spent some time in. This is the kind of place that used to require some proper dining etiquette. I don't find this happening much anymore at Avanti. There hasn't even been a need for valet on my visits over the last several years. That's not a bad thing. Just an observation. Times are changing, and people don't have the money to spend on dinner they used to. One thing that hasn't changed, though, is the food. So I will continue to go back, even if I don't have the time to "dine." I will go back, even though it will always have to be without my grandfather. I will go back just to get a sliver of what this place used to be back in the day ... which was, wait for it, legendary.

Restaurant name  The Bloomfield Sandwich Shop
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
I am beyond happy to finally review this sandwich shop.I've been here only once and it's beyond memorable: It was a late night saturday around 2am and my two friends and I were on a search for late night foods. Matt suggested the Sandwich Shop with a description of a "quiet, low key, good food atmosphere" which was much preferable of any other options at that early hour. So naturally, we are hungry after escaping the hipsters of Remedy we are down for some regular chill.We seat ourselves outside to wait out some of the crowd and drink the remainder of our 6 pack of PBR cans [remember we had just come from hipster/lawrenceville] when out of nowhere our simple pleasurable time is disturbed with the outbreak of a 10 person fight! [we got lucky because this is apparently unusual] -- there was even astonishment from the participants ["REALLY? We are having a fight at the Sandwiche Shoppe????" - yup pronounced that way]Anyways, there was much scramble to break up the fight and not stub out eyes with cigarette buds and the chefs did quite a job at driving the trouble makers away. Surprisingly, no cops came checking anything out just drove along liberty ave.Needless to say this delayed our now greatly awaited sandwiches which we received for free in the process. [we tipped very well that night] The guy making our food brought us our food and engaged us in a friendly chat for about 15 minutes [much needed to restore his nerves]. Also surprising, we were lucky enough not to be involved in this altercation. All together this was a great late night adventure, with dinner AND a show!!! Can't wait for the next visit.I stopped by yesterday for brunch with CM around 1pm.  I'd passed the Bloomfield Sandwich Shop countless times on my bike, and had often wondered about the food and the clientele.  When a friend cancelled alternate brunch plans with my on Fri., but I was still craving breakfast food, the idea occurred to me to finally check this place out.  I'm very glad that I finally did, given the sandwich shop provided me with one of the most memorable brunches I've had in PGH.This place is the definition of a hole-in-the-wall--it's very small inside, so expect to get cozy with the owners and other customers during your visit.  In true diner style, CM and I opted to sit at the counter.  Indeed, space was at such a premium that at a couple points, one of the owners placed dirty plates on the counter a bit closer than I'd like for a minute or two before proceeding to clean them.  As for the decor, the best way to describe it is flower child kitsch, with a dash of sports (indeed, surprisingly, the paper placemats contained sports trivia).  You really do feel as though you're in the owners' kitchen when you're here.  CM described it as organized chaos, which I thought was quite apt.As for the food, as far as I can tell, the sandwich shop offers the most inexpensive breakfast in PGH (aside from McD's, etc.)--everything on the menu is $5 or less, and the portions are generous.  Despite this, as others have mentioned, the quality of the food is quite good--on par with, if not better than, Pamela's, and leaps and bounds above EnP.  CM ordered a hobo cake, a breakfast sandwich consisting of eggs and cheese between two pancakes ($4.50), with bacon (+ $1.25), and I ordered the short stack of pancakes ($4.25) with Nutter Butter cookies and chocolate chips (+ $1.00).  Both entrees were delicious, and very satisfying, not to mention filling.  (In fact, CM fell into a carb coma shortly after going back to his place.)Although the food and prices are great, what really makes eating at the sandwich shop a real experience is the owners, Mike and Mama Ros.  Mike, who waited on us, has a great sense of humor, joking with us and making us feel like family from the time we walked in the door to the time we left--and even afterward (he greeted us again when he and Mama Ros were taking a break at the outside tables as we walked past on our way back to the car after taking a short walk).  From talking to him, we learned that he and Mama Ros have run the sandwich shop for 15 years (impressive!), and that he lived in San Jose, CA prior to moving to PGH.  We didn't get to talk to Mama Ros much, because she was working the grill at the time we were there and it was quite busy, but they both seem like great people.Needless to say, we had an awesome first experience at the Bloomfield Sandwich Shop, and look forward to returning for more.  While I'm tempted to award 5 stars, there were a few minor shortcomings on the food front (use of boxed pancake mix, lack of maple syrup), and the chaotic atmosphere may not be for everyone.  Having said that, if you're looking for cheap and plentiful portions of basic diner fare done well served up by friendly owners, check out this neighborhood institution--it won't let you down!  4.5 stars.I have walked past the Bloomfield Sandwich Shop a million times, but I never tried it.  I assumed it was a greasy and dive-y sandwich place, which is typically not my scene.After talking to Laura M., I decided to come here for breakfast with my family.  I was shocked at the low prices and even more shocked by the beyond friendly owners.  Customer service here is clearly a top priority, and these owners should be applauded for their awesome attitudes.  On top of that, the store has a very wide-range of hours.I ordered a bacon, egg, and cheese bagel, but I was quickly jealous when my dad's sandwich came out on homemade Italian bread!  All of the meals were cheap and good.The only caveat is that on a hot day, the inside of the Shop is stifling hot.  We enjoyed the outdoor seating, though.  I will definitley be back!

I really like SoHo.  First off, it's located on the north shore and close to everything.  Nice bar, friendly staff, sleek and modern.  Great place to watch a game, LCD screens everywhere.  Skip the other appetizers and start with the angry shrimp.  They do a really good job with a filet mignon.  The salmon picata looked yummy, but since it wasn't mine, I didn't get to taste it.  If you don't want a big meal, they have all the usual sandwiches and burgers.  For dessert, have the banana bread pudding or some yummy chocolate fudge cake!  Or, if you're not feeling fancy, just throw back a few beers and bacon cheddar burger.  It's that kind of place, too.We waited forever.Our food wasn't prepared properly (my husband's salmon wasn't cooked well like he asked. He sent it back and they literally just threw it in the microwave, heating the plate and leaving the inside still not cooked through...).Our server was overwhelmed (after a Steelers Game, but still... you should be used to this with the location)Giving a 2-star because my salad was ok, but that's about it. Definitely not coming back.

Restaurant name  Bojangles Restaurant
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
(2.5 stars)I haven't had Bojangles since the early-mid 1990s when I was on vacation in the South.  Bojangles is a fried chicken chain in the Southeast region that would be similar in style and menu to a Popeyes.Connecting through the Charlotte Airport on my way back to LA, I knew I was going to stop at Bojangles to give their chicken a try (this Bojangles is located in Concourse B of the US Airways terminal).  Bojangles may be fast food and a chain, but at least it is a regional chain and provides something different than other nearby airport eateries such as Burger King, Chili's, Quizno's, and KFC.There is a sign posted that says the food gets out within minutes of ordering (to capitalize on those commuters who have to get-it-quick-and-go).  They delivered on their promise because the food came out really quick (less than a minute).  Service was also friendly and efficient.  They also seemed well-staffed to handle peak times.  It looked like many travelers were choosing Bojangles for their layover dining destination.Their individual meals were not in the $5 range, but they were under $10 (which is not bad considering that airport food is often overpriced).  Family meals were also available.  I had three pieces of chicken (2 thighs and a leg) with one side (mashed potatoes and gravy) and a biscuit.The chicken was quite crispy on the outside.  Often, fried chicken at fast food places can be overly fatty or skimpy on the meat, but there was a good portion of chicken meat on the thighs.  The dark meat had the appropriate amount of fat, but it was not too fatty.  The chicken was also juicy.Unfortunately, the chicken was a little bit bland and I was expecting more kick.  Popeyes has a nice spiciness to their chicken, but Bojangles' chicken (on the other hand) could have used a little more heat and seasoning.  Honey and hot sauce were available, which helped give the chicken more flavor.  There was some greasiness to the chicken, but it was fried chicken after all (that is kind of a given).The mashed potatoes were similar to the mashed potatoes you would find at KFC.  Same taste with that signature texture that can only be described as not real-mashed-potato-like.  The gravy at Bojangles had a little more flavor than KFC.  I'm fine with KFC mashed potatoes so I thought this side was okay.The biscuit was large and had a nice, crunchy golden brown top.  Unfortunately, the biscuit was quite dry.Airport food is often average quality, overpriced and the same everywhere.  I still can't figure out how there seem to be Cinnabons at most of the country's airports when they are so hard to find elsewhere.   Since Bojangles is a regional chain, I think it would definitely be worth trying if you are a fan of fried chicken and have some time to kill at the Charlotte Airport.(Irrelevant Note) I sat next to NFL QB Jimmy Clausen on the airplane back to LA and I was surprised that there were not many people in Charlotte who recognized him--especially considering that he was the Carolina Panthers' top draft pick just a few weeks ago.

Review Text :
I have eaten here on several occasions for lunch, and I have mixed reviews about the place.  It's not horrible, but its not the greatest either.For starters, they are tucked away in a really weird spot.  Its in the ASU center, and if you did not know it was there, I really don't know how you would find it.  It's also a rather small location, so there is actually no seating inside the place.  All you can really do is place an order, and take it to go.The few times I have been in there, the service has been pleasant, but not great.  There is a guy who has waited on me before, and I believe he is either the owner, or a manager.  He's friendly and nice, but always involved in a conversation with someone else.  It seemed like the people that he was talking to were his friends, and I had to wait for him to finish talking to them before I could get any service.  Plus, its not like hes neccesarily "waiting" on them.  He's "shooting the breeze" so to say.  Can you say annoying?  Im on lunch hour here people, I don't have time to play games.  I just want to eat my lunch and be done with it, ya know?Anyways, they seem to have a decent menu of items, but the prices are ridiculously expensive.  I can't believe how much this guy charges for his sandwiches.  like $7 for a cheapo sandwich.  The food is good, and the portions are good, but I just find that its not worth the $7-$10 at all...plus you have no seating, and you ignore me when I come in?  yyyeeeaaa.

Review Text :
Bocce Ball's, that was a some spicy Tortillion!What do you think about when you think about Bocce? I know...my thoughts turn immediately to Mexican food, too!Aunt Chilada's has set up a bocce court right next to the walkway in the courtyard. When I first saw the bocce court, it was jarring...like walking by the sushi bar at Houston's...just because you can doesn't mean you should. But, someone near the top of the Chilada family may, in fact, be a marketing genius! That thing really got a workout while we were there the other day.The Beautiful Carin and I hadn't been back to Tia Chilada's in a year or so, but we needed to reconnoiter...my strong and handsome son, Zachary and his lovely wife, Sarah are visiting next week and they want to go (good memories of another great visit:)We wandered in at happy hour (absolutely the best time to visit the Chilada family). Lots of people drinking, eating chips and salsa, etc. (though not as many as past visits...the economy?). We had no trouble getting a nice table out in the patio area, so we could watch an Italian sports staple being played in a Mexican restaurant:)The people watching at Aunt Chilada's is wonderful..all walks of life, all shapes and sizes...all getting their drink on with cheap margarita's and cheaper cerveza:) It's a tried and true formula for the transition from drone infested, uptight (I know, a word right out of the 60's) work-a-day world to a somewhat more relaxed, slightly (or heavily) inebriated night-time world. So much fun to watch...esp. the guy with a six pack of margarita's under his belt, trying to bowl the bocce's. It would be pretty tough to generate a bocce injury, but I think he managed it:)The service was a pretty good...we never had to wait too long for refills and they kept the chips and salsa coming ( the flour tortilla chips are one of the best parts of Aunt Chilada's:)Carin had a serviceable chicken chimichanga, and I had something called a tortillion (which, interestingly enough is numeral based nomenclature for this dish, reflecting the number of calories per serving)...shredded beef, cheese, beans, tomatoes, bacon (bacon!!!!), wrapped in a giant tortilla, dipped in egg batter and deep-fried...it sounded better than it was, but I ate about  1/2 and brought the rest home (might still be in the fridge, growling at me...not sure..afraid to look:)Nope, it's not the best Mexican restaurant in town, and it's not the best bocce court you'll ever see, but combined, they make Aunt Chilada's a decent place to have a bite and a cocktail, and to play the games that people play:)Birthday party. 30 people. Buffet style.I wouldn't go there again, but it was nice enough for that night. Food wasn't spectacular, and there wasn't any sort of view.I guess it's a great place for a party, though.If only more restaurants could be like Aunt Chilada's. I'm happy that I have been able to visit several times and look forward to many more visits in the future!First of all, this place is oozing with history. Did you know that long before Arizona was even a state, this establishment used to be a brothel? Yes, a brothel! Well now, it's of course the furthest thing from a brothel but you can still feel the history living in the walls and parts of the restaurant feel like stepping into a different decade all together.Second of all, the environment. If there's a restaurant that screams party, this is it and I'm talking about a party for all ages. Whether you're visiting with family and looking for a lively establishment with plenty of patio seating, fun games and hearty food, or you're out with friends eager to share some laughs over margaritas, live music and trivia night, this restaurant's got your covered. This is the ideal restaurant for large parties, private parties and more. They have two very large patios with two outdoor bars, a huge indoor bar area, a spacious main dining room and a more private dining room in the back (that happens to be the original building that housed the brothel!) Third, let's talk about the activities. This restaurant knows how to keep their guests entertained! They have live music, trivia nights, bocce ball tournaments, chocolate fountains on Sundays, and special events including a fiesta bash on Cinco de Mayo...just to name a few. Fourth and finally, the food. The food is solid Americanized Mexican food. The Nachos are hefty, the pollo Fundido is cheesy & creamy and the quesadillas are a good greasy (the kind you want when eating a quesadilla). This food is exactly what I would expect and hope for when visiting Aunt Chilada's. It's the perfect type of food for this family-friendly, fiesta inspired establishment. PS - did you know that these fine folks also happen to own Rustlers Rooste...that awesome cowboy establishment in Tempe complete with a live bull, slide and two stepping? Yes, these folks know how to have fun!A friend of mine was staying at the Hilton next door and wanted to meet up for drinks and appetizers.  He suggested this place.  The name sounded cool, so I agreed and we met up on the patio.  After browsing the menu and discussing it with our server, we decided to order:Chips & Salsa (complimentary)http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/aunt-chiladas-phoenix?select=cLT5Wnz9Gp7PpSv8f6iwlg#cLT5Wnz9Gp7PpSv8f6iwlghttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/aunt-chiladas-phoenix?select=dV_M46k5280NMAqvRZt_HQ#dV_M46k5280NMAqvRZt_HQCheese Crisp, $6http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/aunt-chiladas-phoenix?select=LtpyLqMZkia9aPWfXvC4hw#LtpyLqMZkia9aPWfXvC4hwNachos (Pequeno), $8http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/aunt-chiladas-phoenix?select=VXfowISEUAeqLwrwY2rjAw#VXfowISEUAeqLwrwY2rjAwhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/aunt-chiladas-phoenix?select=DdwA5S7yePK3kdfctervSA#DdwA5S7yePK3kdfctervSAhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/aunt-chiladas-phoenix?select=hQjsDYxPVzIu-sYbjOiRXw#hQjsDYxPVzIu-sYbjOiRXwCheese Enchilada, $8.95http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/aunt-chiladas-phoenix?select=T6nvfwi5K01mipaE745_-w#T6nvfwi5K01mipaE745_-wThe Chips & Salsa were average, nothing special.  The Cheese Crisp was pretty good.  The Nachos were very good as well....they heap the toppings on it as you can see in the pictures above.  Of course, I had to try an Enchilada....how could I come to a place named Aunt Chilada's and not have one?!  The Cheese Enchilada I ordered was very good, above average.  Our server was very attentive and made sure our glasses remained full.  We dined on the patio around happy hour on a Wed evening, so it was full of business people after work.  The vibe was very fun and the weather perfect.Return Factor - 86%

It's 4:00 am on a Friday, you've just finished listening to awesome music and drinking too much, you're starving and want some good comfort food to fill your gut and soak up that alcohol..... enter Jerry's.The place was open.  The place was clean.  The food was good.  The service was great.  The prices were great.  WAY better than a Denny's, better than most diner's I've been to, actually.I had ham and eggs and the plate was delicious.  The ham steak was gigantic, the eggs perfect, and hash browns were done just right... crispy and good.I went to Jerry's last night for dinner.  We always eat there and usually like the atmosphere.  This time there were protesters there with anti-Nazi signs.  They told me that a man was present signing books and speaking to a group of people.  His name is David Irving and he was invited to speak by the group about his beliefs that the Holocaust didn't happen.  And that Hitler never knew about the Jews being slaughtered.  This is sick and made me lose my appetite.  Why would a restaurant like Jerry's support a local Neo-Nazi group?  Apparently, they hold the monthly meetings of the group there as well.  I do not plan to return to this location for any meal in case I run across this type of hatred again.4.9.12 Since that time, I have been following the story of David Irving.  He has not returned to this restaurant again but went to a hotel near the airport maybe a year later.  It was guarded by the Phx police red squad.  At least the protesters wacked this mole back into his hole for now.

Review Text :
Before you freak out at the 2 star rating, let me explain myself.  My scale usually goes like this - 3 stars is average (duh), a place I wouldn't necessarily put effort into going to but I wouldn't be totally disappointed if somehow I wound up there.  2 stars would be somewhere I likely wouldn't return and wouldn't recommend to others.  For what T Cooks is trying to be, it is not worth a return trip for me.  Not that the food, decor, service, or anything was that terrible, but for the price there are far better fine dining establishments.  There is absolutely no reason to choose T Cooks or allow others to choose it.  Ok - so this review is based solely on my experience at the wine bar/lounge area and not the actual restaurant.  I was meeting a group of friends here for a cozy cocktail before we all took off to our various locations of origin for the holidays.  On a Tuesday night at 7, the lounge area was PACKED.  I couldn't believe it.  I arrived with my husband and there was only one other person from our party at the bar.  So I scouted the place out and swooped in like a hawk when I saw a party vacate a nice plush couch in the back corner.   The decor is very cozy - wood fireplaces going, low lighting, oak tables, plush couches, beautiful patio - very Spanish villa.  But I guess that this place used to be a Spanish-villa influenced private estate, so no surprise there.  So after being seated, we waited for a server.  And waited.  We noticed only one server in the entire lounge, and people were literally lining up to talk to her, either to get her attention or to simply put in orders.  It turned out she was the only server for the whole lounge!  That's not her fault, but that is definitely some poor management right there.  We ordered some food off the lounge menu and some drinks and proceeded to enjoy ourselves with our friends over the course of the next 3 hours.  I started with the Pinot Grigio and my husband had the 007 martini (or the James Bond martini?  something like that).  Both were good.  For food, we selected the calamari in aioli, the charcuterie plate, and the tenderloin burger.  The calamari was interesting to say the least - the aioli was very watery and almost mayo-y, kind of like cole slaw.  Um, ok?  The tenderloin burger was very plain.  The boursin cheese was creative but it didn't do much to help.  The applewood smoked bacon could best be described as stale - it was extremely brittle, almost hurt to bite into.  It wasn't even that it was "crispy" because even when bacon is properly prepared crispy it's still a little chewy.  The charcuterie plate never came. Over the 3 hours, the crowd died down and we were able to enjoy a little more relaxing atmosphere.  But the service never improved.  Rarely did the server return to our table to check on us.  One of our friends ordered a tenderloin burger much later in the night, and it took almost 45 minutes to get to him.  After our first drinks, I ordered the Sauvingon Blanc and my husband the Russian Valley Pinot Noir.  The SB tasted like pickle juice and my husband exclaimed that it was potentially the worst PN he had ever had.     At the end of the night we got the check.  $117.  For a mediocre burger, strangely prepared calamari, a cocktail, a beer, and 4 glasses of wine between my husband and I (two of which were terrible). Not worth it. Worse, out of curiosity I took a look at the regular restaurant menu.  3 entrees with mushrooms (I hate mushrooms), 1 with duck (to which I'm allergic), and 2 were seafood (based on the calamari, I wouldn't go for the seafood).   So there is absolutely nothing here I would eat.  No reason to return, whatsoever.T Cook's used to be our "old faithful" when we had someone in from out of town and wanted to show them that Phoenix wasn't just about golf, corporate resorts and chain restaurants. The Royal Palms is still our go-to recommendation for visitors with a hefty budget. T Cooks, not so much.4-7 years ago, it was a 5-star review in my book. Although T Cook's is still usually a good meal, it's not a great meal, especially for the price. The menu has stopped going anywhere and the execution is spotty. On last visit, my ravioli appetizer even came out sans sauce on accident. And when you have things like Paella from a wood-fired oven on the menu, you'd expect them to taste inspired and authentic, but I'm usually let down. Their pesto and bread is still out of this world though. A meal in itself.My wife and I got engaged at the Royal Palms. For awhile, we made T Cook's our anniversary dinner. So we'll keep going back to TRP for the fireplaces and cocktails, but I think we'll hold off on T Cook's until we hear that things have changed for the better.I met a friend for here for cocktails a couple of weeks ago.When I got home and answered the query "where did you go for drinks?", I was reminded by the Beautiful Carin just exactly how long it had been since we had been to T Cook's for dinner...apparently a very long time:(Because, while I did remember having dinner there, I couldn't have told you the year or the time of year...luckily, I have the Beautiful Carin to remember these things for me:)You know, I don't why we haven't made it back to T Cook's a little more often!T Cook's is one of those rare places that can genuinely say "everything is good" when you ask for their recommendations:)Maybe it's just me, but the atmosphere, ambiance, service and food combine in subtle (but effective) ways to create a meal experience that you really don't find very often...T Cook's is a jewel:)I have heard that they went through a bit of rough patch, service and consistency-wise, but if our dinner last week is an indicator, they have solved any problems that they might have had:)I was lucky enough to miss any rough spots...3 years between visits will do that for you:)We had a 7:30 reservation, and by 7:38 we were drinking perfectly made, ice cold Ketel One martinis at the table, and enjoying our conversation (Carin is one of the most delightful conversationalists you could ever hope to meet...she still keeps me entertained and enchanted...we still have so much to talk about after all this time:)Onion soup, Lobster Bisque and pate started our meal (and could have completed it...it was so good...fortunately, I'm a big eater:)Carin had Poulet Rouge (Red Chicken? Seriously, the menu nomenclature people need to re-think that one...When I think of red chicken, I think of salmonella, but that's not what they mean:) I know, I know... they mean the chicken is red with pecan wood smoke, and it is and it's a terrific dish, but still...the name:)I had braised short ribs...perfectly done with a marvelous horseradish infused risotto cake:)...Inspired:)They also have some very pleasant and tasty sides:)We had brussel sprouts (that were nearly as good as the sprouts I make at home:)...and potato puree...and seared Foie Gras...decadent and wonderful:)I tried to get Carin to have the foie gras with me, but we differ in our opinions about foie gras, and so, I had to take the bullet and eat it all myself:)...That should make my cardiologist buddies happy:)Time really can stand still when you're having an evening like this...by the time we finished our shared Chocolate Napoleon and coffee, it was 10:30 and way past our bed time:)But such a pleasant evening...never any rush from the servers, never a wait for the next course...everything perfectly timed, completely unobtrusive (no, our conversation was never interrupted to inquire "do you love everything?":)It was worth staying up late for an evening as pleasant as this...and almost worth waiting three years for, too!But we won't wait three more years to swing by T Cook's again...they are just too good and right in the hood:)I dream of the day I have enough riches that I can hang out in places like Royal Palms regularly. I mean the night I showed up, well it was night, but it was also pouring down rain, and even through all of that Royal Palms was pretty enough to make me stop and look around before rushing in out of the weather. I headed into the bar to meet up with a few folks and the interior is just a beautiful space - warm and welcoming, and very classy. Bring people here that you want to impress.I, of course, had to order a glass of champagne and the lovely server brought it right to me. Perhaps she sensed I had been delayed at the airport that day before arriving to Phoenix for 7 hours? Or more likely they are just very good at what they do here. We immediately ordered since it was so late and I started with a pear, pecan, and blue cheese salad. For my main course I choose a seared Irish salmon that was served with leeks, tomato gratin, and a pea puree. It was all fantastic, but the tomato gratin made me want to invite the chef to move to LA with me. I mean no way could I afford that now, but a girl can dream!We finished by sharing a couple of desserts and the one I chose was the Florale. It was made with lychee mousse and was quite light and just a bit tart. All in all a delicious ending to a delicious meal.I am just going to leave at this: this is phoenix: people don't know better.When our server introduced us by saying the chef was on the iron chef program - I knew right then we were going to have a less then adequate meal.....When there was a plethora of shellfish and no game on the menu I knew we were going to have a less then adequate meal (this is ARIZONA in the winter y'all!) Escargot - really? in Arizona?Though menu items usually have spare descriptions I am used to elegant presentations with many components (a la Iruna). Especially all the "hype" around T.Cooks - alas my salad was mixed greens and sliced pears - yes mixed greens and sliced pears - made me giggle (then I remembered this was phoenix).So ordering the duck breast - I was thinking this will be okay - sigh - why was my duck breast rubbery? I am guessing after they seared the breast the chef/cook sliced it too fast neglecting to wait the minute for the meat to rest - forcing my duck breast to be inedible...Then I looked around the room (gasp) white haired old people abound - these folks are from Phoenix - ha! They are having a grand ol time - ok I won't dog them but how about the mousy haired frumpy chick next to us with the beaded topDessert - we may have had dessert - I think we did - it was that memorable.Service was lovely - our server was proper - that's nice - but I will trade bad service for excellent food any day of the week.So yea - this is not the place for good food-

I'm a huge quesadilla fan. I'm also a big fan of fresh food. In addition to that, as often as possible I like to be a patron of the small locally held businesses in the area where I live. I like spending my money there because they spend their money here and we all know that's good for the local economy. Okay so here we go.This place has a pretty big blue sign on the front of the store. They have a half a dozen or so parking spaces of their own in front. It's nothing to look at but what goes on under the hood is pretty darn special. There is only about 5' x 12' of walking space in front of the counter. Directly in front of you when you walk in the door there are pork rinds, Cabeza, Cow Tongue and a few other traditional Mexican entrées nicely seasoned and cooked. In the back behind the counter you can see through an open door, a team of folks working hard and making tortillas. This is what I was here for. Now over to your right they have prepackaged in a few different denominations and sizes fresh tortillas made probably only earlier that day and packaged right there on the spot. I bought myself a dozen 12 inch flour tortillas for $1.98 . . . . I couldn't wait to rip open the package and try one right outside the store (I ended up eating three)  Yummy ! All I can say now is I don't know if I can go back to the ones I used to get at Fry's. If any of you have ever had fresh flower tortillas you already know what I'm talking about. Check it out for yourself!!

Cash ONLY This is a real deal deli, family owned and operated. They have just about everything you could ask for. I always get the sandwich, usually some type of smoked ham. They are large and usually can be a meal for two. The staff is wonderful and very helpful. There are only two 4top tables inside the deli. Cash ONLYThis deli may seem out of place as it is set in a corner lot dominated by a Food City and other Hispanic oriented businesses.  Those who went to the old Chompie's in the same shopping center might even have missed it.Have been getting lunch here for quite a few years now.  It is a real Old World family run deli.  The meats in here are wonderful.  I think a Polish family owns the place.The have a list of sandwiches that are all HUGE, super tasty and very affordable ( with tax around $7). Skip those chain subway shops and get a real sandwich here!As mentioned by Daren, this place might take cash only.  I think they do take debit cards, but you have to order a certain $ min....be safe and take cash.  This place gets busy at lunchtime and there are about 3 tables in here.  Better to take you grub to a less crowded spot to savor it in peace...Warning: You will go for lunch and want to buy about 10 lbs. of deli meat!

I am a pretty easygoing guy. I would've overlooked the fact(s) that:1. Jim Beam is your only bourbon. 2. For some reason two drinks came out to $9.90.* 3. Even with only 10 people in the bar, the music was absolutely deafening. 4. You charge a $3 cover for no discernible reason.5. Rolling blunts is apparently kosher inside the bar, but sharing, not so much.However, I can't let this slide: your claw machine is BULLSHIT. That is the weakest claw of all time, and there's no chance it is EVER picking up anything in that cage. I feel violated, and I want my dollar back. ___________*I think that's some sort of weird PA tax thing.

Review Text :
I took my boyfriend to get the Omakase dinner at Umi as a Christmas present - it seems like the best location to go for a special occasion, something really memorable.We made a reservation for a Saturday evening, and got a little dressed up - with the dim lighting and sleek decor, it's fun to wear something here besides regular ol' jeans.  The host was very friendly, taking our coats when we arrived, and our server was equally gracious.  Umi is a place with truly skilled service, one of the few places I've eaten in town with utterly professional staff.  They are knowledgeable and skillful, and they added tremendously to our dining experience.The Omakase dinner is pricey, I think around $85 per person for seven courses and dessert, which is what we got.  The eleven-course meal, at around $130, just seemed like too much for our first try at this.  Alas, time has passed since our meal and I failed to write the courses down anyway, but here's the general scoop: Most of the seven courses were prepared raw.  I'd say five out of seven.  There were 3-4 sashimi courses - just raw, unspeakably fresh fish dressed delicately in various sauces and flavorings.  One course was gently fried tempura rock shrimp, another was cooked - I want to say black cod, but the rest were sashimi or sushi, appearing incredibly simple but tasting complex.  We took our server's recommendation for sake - it was pricey, but floral and delicious.  My boyfriend raved about the meal as each course came and went - we both had a wonderful experience.  I will give it five stars, but I hesitate only because it was such a pricey experience.  I have no doubt that the fish was impeccably fresh and certainly worth paying for, but the bill for two of us was well over $200 including the sake.  And the food, while excellent, was extremely light and delicate.  Now I'm not a big fan of being stuffed to capacity, but with an $85 meal, I hoped to have a little bit more food.  I was also hoping to have a little more variety - perhaps this was my ignorance, but I was surprised that 4 of the courses were sashimi - just four thin, amazing pieces of fish on a plate.  They were all wonderful - but it was a lot of sashimi.  I was hoping for something more substantial, more bold, perhaps?But that doesn't change the fact that every bite of food we did have was of impeccable quality.  I'd recommend omakase only to those who are celebrating a special occasion, love raw fish, and are willing to pay over $100 per person for food and drink.  I think in the future, I'd come back and just order a variety of sashimi and maki.  And Umi was a class act, from start to finish, with outstanding service and chefs who are clearly passionate about their product.I can't believe I haven't reviewed this yet because it was simply incredible!Seriously folks, if you're looking for a nice night on the tahn, look no further!  And my words of advice: DO THE OMAKASE TASTING MENU!  There's really nothing more to tell you other than you will find it incredible, I guarantee!  The Omakase tasting menu is either a seven course or eleven course dinner with dessert.  It's indulgent and worth every penny (at $85 and $130 respectively).  The plates served to you are small, but honestly not as small as I thought they'd be and the desserts, seriously, massive!  We had the salmon tartare, sawara seared with hot sesame oil, fluke sashimi, black cod with miso, tuna shashimi rock shrimp tempura and an array of sashimi (toro, snapper, salmon, tuna and saward).  Honestly everything was fantastic and fresh, just like fish should be.   Like I said, the desserts were all amazing and most of the choices were very rich.  I really enjoyed the chocolate maki and the inventive house made ice creams.  The overall experience blew me away.  From the service, to the food to the atmosphere it's a perfect 5 star place and if you live here and haven't been, don't wait any longer!My omakase 11 course chef tasting was one of my most rememberable dining experiences in Pittsburgh. As he prepared our beginning courses, the chef and I spoke Chinese together talking of our time in Taiwan. As we entered our later courses, a couple from Taiwan sat down. We were all speaking Chinese together and had a really unique experience here in America. The food was absolutely amazing! I kept myself hydrated between courses with the lychee fiz, followed by glasses of prosecco. Each of the 11 courses was better than the previous one. If you are hesitating between the omakase tasting or the regular menu, I would definitely suggest for the 11 course option. You may still be hungry after 9 courses.  Troy Polamalu was in the dining room as well.

So before we dove into the rice pudding last night, I thought we should eat something with some more substance and nutrition... and although I'm not the biggest pizza fan, I swear I've heard somewhere that pizza is considered the perfect balanced meal!I did make a spinach salad to go along with it, but calling ahead to Ray's was quick and easy.  We ordered one large Sicilian cheese pizza (actually, Jared ordered it this way - I would've ordered some fun toppings but oh well) for the four of us to share.  Turns out it was plenty... One piece was just enough for me - they are big slices and even with the guys eating two slices each, there were a couple leftover slices too!Ray's was pretty impressive - if you like a little bit of grease on the pizza, Ray's delivers just that... I followed my friend's lead and blotted it a bit with a napkin before diving in and devouring my slice.  I would 100% take out from Ray's again... it was reasonably priced ($16.50 for a large - actually, that may be a bit pricey for pizza but since I don't eat it very often, I am kind of clueless); it travels well, and I bet leftovers are just as good if not better - actually, I'll find out today when I have them for lunch!Moved to Phoenix in July and as a native New Yorker, one of my greatest worries was that I wouldn't be able to find decent pizza anywhere. It may or may not have kept me up a night or two... ;)First day in Phoenix: I'm starving, the movers haven't arrived, and I don't have anything to consume in my new place.  I drive down the street and see Famous Ray's.  I say, "hell, you're gonna have to start somewhere." I go inside.  Typical NY style pizza joint.  Order at the counter, pay, get your drink, have a seat...they'll call you when it's ready. The folks working the counter are definitely from NY (in case you couldn't tell by their ridiculously strong accents and all of the NY sport posters strewn across the wall).  Getting a good vibe so far.My name is called and I eagerly retrieve my pizza.  It looks just like what I'd get in NY.  More good vibes!  I taste it and I'm in heaven.  Seriously, it's so good that I have never been to another pizza place since I moved to Phoenix because I honestly don't have to (or want to!).  They have an everyday special of 2 slices and a fountain drink for $5.00 (can't beat that with a stick). They don't do delivery (boo), but I don't care.  I'd drive 50 miles for this pizza.Seriously, I think the stars aligned on my first day in the Valley of the Sun.  How else could you possibly explain how I found my pizza soul mate on my very first day here???  Moral of the story is: if you want legit NY style pizza, Famous Rays is your place.

When I moved back to Pittsburgh from New York I found myself in constant withdrawal because I no longer had a taco truck on my block to satisfy my cravings.  I had pretty much lost hope in Pittsburgh until I came across Edgar's Taco stand at Reyna Foods.  These are probably the best tacos PIttsburgh has to offer.  The tacos are also picture perfect.  I have never seen such a beautiful taco.  Seriously.For only $5 (plus tax), you can get two tasty and fresh tacos.  The ingredients are super fresh, and the tacos are prepared on the spot.  The actual taco is a perfect blend, and they are packed full.  I got the carnitas and pollo tacos.  They meat was not spiced as well as I wanted, and they were a little too mild for my taste.  There also wasn't any sauce/salsa/etc. out, and this lead to a rather mild taco.  However, I plan to come back for the full experience soon.This is definitely the best place to find real deal tacos in Pittsburgh.  The staff was super friendly, and I can't wait to try the burritos as well!"Jalapeno tostadas...yum!" That was a tip I shared a while back, let me go just a little deeper. That Hot sauce you found, loved and could never locate again? Reyna's has it. Biggest hot sauce collection in town. The same goes for BBQ sauces, any Latin ingredient you can think of, salsas out the wazoo, HANDMADE tortillas and tortilla chips so good they supply the best Mexican restaurants in Pittsburgh, fresh salsas, scorpion lollipops (for your wild, still sweet self), loose beans, herbs and all sorts of goodies in bins in the back....including dried hibiscus flowers that I make my mango hibiscus daiquiris with!Whatever you need, Reyna's has it. If they don't, ask...they do their best to get it! And don't miss the taco stand outside or the restaurant downstairs. Whatever Reyna's does, it's top notch!

Review Text :
The wife and I visited Barrington's for our first anniversary dinner.  I cannot say enough good things about our experience.  While this is not the sort of location you dine at while on a budget, I can say with complete confidence that it is worth every penny.There are a lot of high end eateries in town that feel that they are expensive simply to be expensive, while the food may be good, the staff may be well trained, with ambiance well appointed, they still sometimes feel like they are trying to recreate something else.  Barrington's is not one of these restaurants.Our appetizers were excellent.  The beverages were poured and priced appropriately.  Our entrees were astronomical.  Erin had the bacon wrapped trout, a real treat, while I opted for their special - essentially lamb two ways (chop & cheek) - it turned out to be one of the best dishes I have ever ordered at a restaurant.Service was top notch.  Our server, noticing Erin was pregnant pre-empted any concerns by pointing out that what we ordered was baby friendly.   They are knowledgeable, not pushy, friendly and quick.  Woody was our server, I will request him in the future.The bottom line - if you are looking for a change of pace, something that will challenge you to try something different, but still comfortable, a place which will exceed expectations, which knows what they are doing and focuses on doing it 110% every time, I highly recommend you dine with the crew at Barrington's.Call ahead, do not expect seating to be available on the weekends without a reservation, you may be able to sit at the bar but a meal like this deserves a table.Bon apetite!WOW! All I can say is WOW! Up till now, Zebra was the best restaurant in Charlotte that I ate at. Now, it's Barrington's! My best friends were visiting from TN, and I wanted to treat them for their Birthdays (There were 3 of them visiting). I knew it wouldn't be cheap but what the heck....you only live once, right?Now understand that me and my group of friends are real "foodies." We've had the fortune at eating at some of the best restaurants in the country. Not bragging, just giving some context here. So we typically go "all out" when possible, and given the special nature of this night, we certainly went "all out."So, to start the dinner off, we ordered the French Onion soup AND TWO pasta dishes since I read that they are famous for their pasta. This was basically "for the table" (i.e., we made it family style). My GOD. The French Onion soup was nothing like I've ever had before. Obviously reconstructed to a fine, modern twist. It didn't have your regular "toasty cheese" on top. Oh no.....it had a fine "cheese FOAM" in the center which was like a rich, cheesy sour cream but way better. The Onions were sweet and savory. Just about the best I've ever had! The pasta? IF you ever come here, you've GOT to order the gnocchi! It was freakin phenomenal! Don't know how else to say it. It had fresh parmesan, braised veal and porcini mushrooms which was layered with elegant yet powerful flavors. That sounds contradictory......you get the picture. It was GREAT!As if the pasta and soup weren't enough, we also added the Foie Gras. I mean, how could you NOT order Foie Gras if it's on the menu! It was wrapped in Prosciutto, over a homemade fig bar surrounded by a blackberry sauce. Again, RIDICULOUSLY good!We're basically full at this point. BUT we've GOT to brave more food! So we got the Ashley Farms chicken, the Crispy Duck and the Beef Short Ribs. Again, WOW! My gourmand buddies BOTH said that it was the BEST duck they've ever had! And I assure you that we've eaten LOTS of little duckies in our lived. This one had to be brinned for days as it was UBER moist......practically melt in your mouth. Yet he kept the skin crispy. That my friends takes great cooking technique. Same with the chicken. The skin was the best part...you can see the bird was pressed down to ensure even cooking while getting the skin very crispy. Some of the best chicken I've ever had, and probably THE BEST my friend had. The shortribs were also delicious. Not the best I've ever had (that goes to Roy's out West), but certainly the best in Charlotte! Oh and just for you know what and giggles, we ordered all 3 of the side dishes: Truffle Mashed potatoes, Garlic Spinach and Roasted Mushroom. Verdict for the main courses and sides? Just incredible!Now we're WAY overstuffed. So we get dessert. Why not? We do "cut back" and only order 2 desserts (but 3 portions). My friends all got the warm chocolate pudding cake. This title is misleading......it's more like a souffle, a flour-less one! Everything is made in house, including their ice cream. This was a decadent dish, a dream for chocolate lovers. I got the warm cinnamon bun, with some of THE BEST ice cream I've ever had....a brown butter pecan ice cream. We all suggested to the waitress that the Chef sell this in the grocery stores. It was uber yummy! All over a CARAMEL drizzled bun.Now, here's what I think many people overlook. While the did have a decent and affordable wine list, my group and I are REAL oenophiles. Not snobs by any means, just true wine lovers. So I did some research and found out that Barrington's only charges a $20.00 corkage fee. This is VERY low for a high quality dining establishment. So I brought 3 very special wines from my cellar, and figured at $20/bottle, so $60.00 total for 3 wines that could have totaled $2000.00 in some restaurants (I told you we went all out). So I thought that was a steal. When I got the bill (yes, I paid!) I saw that they only charged me $20 for ALL the wine I brought! Again, WOW!Finally, I was STUNNED by the final bill. Here we go "all out" and I was thinking maybe $500.00 or something for the FOUR of us. But no, It was under $300.00. Not cheap by any means. BUT keep in mind that we ordered 3 appetizers, 2 full pasta dishes (which are entrees), 4 other entrees, all 3 sides, and 3 desserts. That my friends is a LOT of food. For under $300? For 4 people? I mean, you couldn't possibly order more food. This was a food lovers paradise and the bill was incredibly reasonable!Out in Las Vegas this mean would have been $1000.00+!!! I can NOT believe at how reasonable the prices are in this restaurant. Again, please keep in mind that this is a FINE DINING establishment! So when I say "reasonable" I'm comparing it to other restaurants of similar quality. From that perspective, it's a STEAL!Both my best male friends said it was THE BEST MEAL of their lives. It was in my Top 5 for sure.That is a TREMENDOUS compliment to the Chef and this restaurant.

If you are looking for a no frills Friday night fish fry that will blow your mind, this is your place. I am giving this place 5 stars because it is wonderful for a very simple meal, with excellent service.  We had a little trouble finding the door (the entrance is in the back facing away from Packers Ave.) but once we walked in and sat at one of their wobbly tables, we were instantly greeted by our friendly server.  Though the bar was busy, we got our drinks immediately, along with a basket with two basic white bread rolls and coleslaw.  All very standard issue.  The fish was another story. Whoa.  I got the Canadian perch and my boyfriend got the Canadian walleye.  The large single piece of walleye was lightly breaded and fried perfectly.  It was buttery, non-fishy, and totally delicious.  The baked potato that came with it was pretty standard, but good.  The perch was battered differently in a thicker, more crunchy coating.  The little strips were just AMAZING.  I got a pile of 7 or 8 strips that I honestly couldn't stop eating.  The fries were done to perfection as well.  My boyfriend and I are somewhat light eaters in general, but we cleared out all of that fried goodness in one sitting.  On the way out the cooks from the back yelled good bye, the bartender wished us a good night, and someone standing by the door smiled and asked us to come back soon.  I can't say enough about how friendly everyone here is.  It looks like a burned out biker bar, but their simple menu is done right.  I never thought I would like a place so much that doesn't have salad on their menu, but I anticipate we will be back many many more times.

HELLO new neighborhood watering hole!  This place is legit!  Moving to the new hood in Dormont means finding a new go to bar.  I need a my hood bar to have a good selection of beer (I accept Yuengling and hopefully a rotating seasonal list) and good bar food.  Good bar food doesn't have to be good.  I mean, it has to be good, but it doesn't have be gourmet poutine, if you know what I'm sayin'?  Cain's totally surprised me because they have a mega beer list, with lots of drafts on tap, and this particular night Southern Tier Pumking was in the hizzouse!  Their menu is HUGE too!  Tons of faves like wings and burgers but the intriguing "Codfather," which I will take part in at some point!  I was in the mood for a Rachel, because well, why not... it's my name!  The Rachel was awesome, with a good amount of turkey, but not overwhelming and lots of coleslaw, which is totally how I like it!  The rye was fresh and toasted and it all came together perfectly.  But the fries, the fries win my seal of approval!  They were crisp and seasoned correctly, which is a winning fry in my opinion.  I'll see you soon Cains, and will be working my way through your extensive draft list and food menu on the reg!

Review Text :
After a trip to Target, we were hungry so my daughter and I stopped in for some dinner here.  She loves salad bars since she can pick out what she likes and just eat that.  It was about 8pm on a week night so they were not busy.  We were greeted warmly and paid then went to the salad bar.  Things had not been restocked but that's ok, there was still plenty and it was good.  They had some different salad....an oriental noodle one that I liked, and of course soup and bread.  For dessert they had the soft serve ice cream that is so yummy and lots of toppings to go with it.  The place was clean and the staff was nice.  It's nothing outstanding but it was good and we were full.  And it was fairly inexpensive too.

Restaurant name  Marcellino Ristorante
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
I'm an  Italian girl from New York and I can honestly say: Marcellino is one of the BEST Italian restaurants in the Valley. If you like home made pasta, flavorful sauces, great wine and all the other elements that make a great Italian place - this is it! It even reminds me of a place back east with the owner (owner's wife?) working the door and the old school dessert ray presented by the waiter. Marcellino is not cheap, but it's price in on par with other high end Italian like Bravo Bistro, Um Bacio, Le Cabaffe, Tamasos...etc. But Marcellino might be the best!It is with pleasure that I bestow upon Marcellino Ristorante my coveted 5 star review                                                                                                                                                        *  *  * FANFARE *  *  *                  Where do I begin?  How about with the amuse busch (to build anticipation in the palette).  Moments after we received the menu a plate arrived with a couple wonderfully pungent olives, several small slices of some kind of salami and 4 small chunks of what I believe was pecorino cheese.  A delicious start and we had barely opened the menu.We shared the Gamberi e Feta antipasti.  Two HUGE jumbo shrimp (I didn't think the word jumbo really did those bad boys justice) grilled perfectly...tender and juicy.  They were served on a square of lightly fried feta cheese and a bed of cabbage.  The arrangement was so nice that I didn't want to disturb it.After that we shared 2 entrees:The Fagottino di Pollo and the Salmone in Crosta di Porcini con Cognac e Porri.  I am not a big fan of salmon but I could become a fan of this salmon.  Flaky, delicious fillet with a wonderful cognac sauce.  I was less thrilled with the chicken.  It was split chicken breasts layered with proscuitto and fontina cheese and smothered in a brown sauce.Here's the thing about the Fagottino di Pollo.  When I say I was less thrilled I mean it was 4 star chicken.  Everything else about the food and service was 5 stars.  Flat out.  We shared a couple desserts - a tirimisu and a dark chocolate mousse.  The tirimisu had all the right flavors working - mascarpone cheese, chocolate, espresso, rum, lady fingers.  Delicious.  The mousse was also very good.  Dangerously good.Along the way we had a very well rounded chianti ( Chianti "I Sodi", Badia Morrona ) and a very nice white ( Albana "Colle Del Re" ).  Even the brewed coffee I had after dessert was very good.Service was outstanding throughout the evening.  All in all I would place Marcellino Ristorante on the short list of Phoenix's finest restaurants.How can I not give Marcellino five stars?The food was fantastic - as was the experience.  We'd been hearing about Marcellino Ristorante for awhile but it wasn't until we were looking for a place to celebrate Mother's Day that we thought to check it out.From the moment I called to make a reservation, we received the friendliest service ever!  I was told that they could take our group at 6:45 and that they'd have a live Opera Singer (specifically a Tenor) in house that night performing - what a treat!  Well - that's what I figured when they told me that.  (None of us were opera fans before and we still are not opera fans, but it did add to the experience!)We were seated right away and Scott was our server.  He was attentive and patient with us, even when Jared had him repeat the specials several times.  Their homemade pasta specials looked incredible, but I stayed away... Instead, I enjoyed the Insalata Ortolana, a few bites of the Canestina Polenta (if you like polenta and you like mushrooms, get this - it's incredible), and I shared the Gamberi Affogtai entree with my mother-in-law-to-be.  We requested extra veggies instead of mashed potatoes and not only did they oblige, but the broccoli, cabbage, and asparagus we received were delicious!  The shrimp were magnificent as well - juicy and tender!  Oh - I have to also admit to having some of the 'special sauce' they serve with the bread basket... it is tangy and wonderful - if you go, you must try that too.  It's made with eggplant, olive oil, and red pepper I believe... yum!Jared and his sister had a Caprese Salad (a bit overpriced at $12.95), the Paccatelli al Ragu (a bolognese pasta dish I believe), the Scaloppine al Gorganzola (a veal dish that he enjoyed but serving size was not as big as he'd wished for).  We finished off the meal with an Apple Galetta served with hazelnut gelato and a Panna Cotta (similar to flan).  While I had just a small taste of the apple one, I can report that it was delicious... and since Jared and his mom finished off the panna cotta, i'll assume it was not so bad either.All of the above plus a pellegrino, a coffee, and a cappuccino for $159.85 before tip.  Note - no alcohol.So, yes, we wish it was more affordable - but we'll be back without a doubt!

Restaurant name  Bombay Grille

Review Text :
I've been coming to Bombay Grille for more than 6 years now.  It never fails to surprise me every time that I pull into the place that it somehow keeps the lights on and stays in business.  Now let me be clear, I'm surprised it stays in business because every time I go there for lunch, it's dead.  Shocking really at any buffet, but especially at a buffet where the food is as good as it is here.  It's really really good.  The naan is fresh, the Chicken Kormi and chicken curry are delicious.  Any time they serve lamb, consider yourself lucky - it's amazing.  To top it off, they often have rice pudding available to finish off the destruction of your blood sugar.  It's great!  The only problem is that it usually has to sit on top of two plates of delicious food and soup which means your stomach is about to overflow.  The service is also respectable, and it seems as though the same 4 or 5 guys are always working, so if you're a regular, they'll recognize you.  The only reason it's not a 5 star place is the decor and cleanliness.  I'm not saying its dirty, but it's not sparkling, and the dimly lit dining room doesn't bestow confidence in germaphobes.  I would however recommend this place to any foodie type who knows that sometimes you have to look past some of the details to find the gems.

ONO doesn't begin to cover how amazing this food is!i grew up in Hawaii and, although NOTHING will ever stand up to the food on the island, this place comes pretty damn close as far as "plate lunch" goes.  the chicken katsu is good, the spam musubi (awesome snack when you're out surfing for the day...a personal fave) is wonderfully delicious...i LOVE the sauce they put under the spam...i'm thinking it's the katsu sauce, but i could be wrong.  my fave tho is the island curry chicken.  it has a kick, but it's freakin AWESOME!  the macaroni salad is to die for...my advice, if you're feeling naughty, skip the rice and ask for two scoops of the macaroni salad...totally worth the calories.oh, more advice.  go for the mini meal.  it might sound small, but it is the PERFECT size!  just enough to fill you up!mahalo to whatever lolo brought this grub out to all the haoles in phx!When you are in the mood for some light food, that is very flavor filled. Then Ono is the place. Teresa showed me this place, other wise I would of never known.It is tucked away in a shopping center on Thomas.Busy place and now that I have been here a few times, I have to say it is always good. I like it to go though, because, it is always so busy and so much noise. I just feel better taking it home.The Macoroni Salad is really good. It is great food to take on a picnic or an outing.The food is very fresh as well. Probaly because, they do such a great business nothing has time to get old. It is worth the time to check this place out, Bra!

Review Text :
I stopped by for a ham and cheese croissant two weeks ago, and I can't recall the last time I felt so ripped off.  I actually wanted to get my hazelnut royale fix, but balked at the price tag- $6 a piece!  After a few minutes, the male owner talked me into trying the croissant.  After he heated it up in the microwave, he charged me $8, plus tax, which I felt was too much, esp. for a croissant that is almost a day old.  I wished it was more crispy, but since it was microwaved, the bottom was very soggy, and only the very top layers were slightly crispy.  After a few bites, I perused through tthe take-out menu and couldn't find the croissant under the dinner menu; Instead, I found it under the breakfast menu- $5.95 with white sauce, and $6.55 with scrambled eggs.  So I was charged $8 for a plain ham and cheese croissant that was a breakfast leftover??  I left very disappointed with my dinner selection that day, and with ever-increasing prices, I won't be coming back soon, if ever.Bonjour ooo la la yummeee, If you like fresh made from scratch daily french pastries this is where the magic happens! Oh they also Cater!I have been coming here since they first opened Catherine and her husband Pierre are Tre' sweet! They always have a tasty variety and they are very good at making suggestions that will satisfy whatever it is you have a taste for. Excusez-moi Aileen B, It is a fresh croissant house made throughout the day and it's with black forrest ham and imported cheese, at the Esplanade you got off cheap for 8.00. Starbucks has a tiny turkey and swiss for 6 bucks and it's not on homemade anything. I eat here at least once a week, love the baguettes. They also make olive bread which is Divine! Katharine makes the best scrambled eggs! I also love the salmon sanwich (yes that's french for sandwich lol) on a baguette. My grandparents came to visit from Illinois. I brought them here for lunch. 1st because I love it and 2nd my grandfather is from Lens, France. He loved everything he had and said the baguette reminded him of his mothers. He also enjoyed speaking a little french with Pierre and Catherine. He is a little rusty in the french department. Au Petit Four makes me proud to be 1/4th french. Au revoir, Bon appétit!Pricey due to high esplanade rent. Great stop before or after your AMC. Choose pastries not baguette. --wow. $65 for two sandwiches with side salads, bottle of lemonade, sparkling water and dessert.  --baguettes not authentic. --pasta salad bland--but its all about the bread for a proper sandwich mixte avec crudities. And this bread was NOT it. --great cafe feel and French owners lend authenticity--worth it for the the pastries. Still on a quest for the proper French baguette.Au Petit Four makes its home in an unassuming location within the Esplanade. This is a great little bakery and the perfect caffeine fix during the workday. While I haven't had a chance to try their croissants and baked goods, they smelled delicious and I'm counting the days until my return. Their iced coffee is spectacular. The sugar free vanilla and Carmel is straight from France and it makes the perfect blend of refreshing coffee with a huge caffeinated kick. The staff is friendly and they have great seating to stay for awhile and do work. So in summary, Au Petit Four is tres bon for baking, coffee and work essentials and I look forward to coming back and trying out their food!Beware being ripped off at Au Petit Four!  If only i can give no star, i would.  We dined late on a Saturday night. We were the only table in the restaurant.  The desserts were good, but very expensive- (1) coffee $2.00, (2) Arrowhead water $2.00, (1) Lorina lemonade $3.50, (1) mango mousse cake, (2) Creme brûlées, (1) chocolate chip cookie, (1) white cake, all total to $48.50.  It was an indication when there were no price tags for the desserts.  The owner didn't even give us an actual bill, but just came by to tell us the total.  We were all pretty tired and didn't give too much thought of the amounts. I am extremely disappointed, SHAME ON YOU AU PETIT FOUR!Review 2/5/12We were searching for a place to end the night with dessert.  We found Au Petit Four on Yelp and their were .4 miles from where we were.  COOL!  And we had their desserts before at the Esplanda location, so we know the the stuff is good.  Parking was almost impossible.  It is hard to find a space but we have a promise of good desserts so we grab the kids and walked.  They have only been in the new location for 6 weeks.  It was pretty nice.  So we all walked to the dessert case.  Everything looked good.  We settled on:1 Coffee, 3 Bottled waters, 1 Lemonade, 1 mango cake, 2 creme brulees, 1 white chocolate cake, and 1 large chocolate chip cookie.  There wasn't a pricing for any of the things we ordered, so when he came to tell us our bill was $48.50.  We were shocked.  WHAT?  No detailed bill?  The kids were tired and we just wanted to leave.  10 items for $48.50 = Average $4.85 per item since we don't know the prices (non alcohol drinks and dessert)!  REALLY?????  I feel a little ripped off.Who are these penny squeezing, sour puss, little fusspots on a mission to slander this place? HERE'S THE TRUTH: the owner, PIERRE (yes, that's right, the most French name any Frenchman could have) is from Lyons, France (that's right, the culinary capital) and is passionate about good food. His pastries are fantastic. They have a new FRENCH chef who makes amazing and authentic French food.  -- Are you getting the theme here: FRENCH from FRANCE!!!It is superb food. The owner couldn't be nicer. Service was excellent. And, here's the deal with the prices. The have this thing called a 'menu' which lists, in an itemized fashion, adjacent to each dish, the PRICE. You can actually calculate what the bill will be by summing each item ordered, adding tax and tip. -- I know, completely crazy new concept; but they have it here, and it works beautifully. That way, you won't be shocked by the prices. Another thing: This is SCOTTSDALE, which is like the Beverly Hills of Arizona. Real estate is expensive; the clientele expects good product and pays for it. You don't walk into Barneys of NY and SCREAM how frigg'n expensive it is and how you can get pants in Walmart for a fraction of the price. -That would reflect poorly on YOU, not Barneys. -- Same goes for this place. Bottom line: GREAT food, GREAT service, STUPID reviewers.

Restaurant name  T-Bones On the Lake

Review Text :
I'm so over T-Bones.I used to relish the thought of hanging out on their big deck on one of the first warm days of the year, treating myself to their yummy grilled chicken salad or wings--the only 2 things on their menu that I liked.  I was even willing to tolerate the funky smell of the main restaurant on my way out to the deck.  But the last 3 times I've been to T-Bones, the food and service have been awful.  And they changed the menu, removing the grilled chicken breast salad that I liked.  The sweet tea was almost as clear as water, and painfully sweet--undrinkable.I'm sorry, T-Bones.  We tried to make it work, but it takes two.  Please stop relying on the fact that you're the only place (I know of) in the area where you can eat the water's edge.  It's just not enough to keep us coming anymore.  You actually have to serve good food and decent drinks.Great atmosphere and location, but the food is sad, just sad. Won't be coming back. It's fine if you want to enjoy a few beers by the water, but don't come hungry.What on earth has happened to T Bones?! This used to be an awesome place back in the late 90's and I used to hang here all the time.  It's been years and years since I have been and wanted to take my husband for dinner. The first thing that hits you is the smell when you walk in the lobby.  It's fishy, but it's not coming from the lake.  The place needs a complete professional, deep detailed cleaning. There is dust and cobwebs everywhere and a thick film of just nastiness on the surfaces.  The menus are dirty and sticky. They were not busy. Our waitress was young and was way more interested with her phone and the male waitstaff than providing us good service. I remembered the filet tips being amazing and my husband wanted to try something new so he got a peanut chicken sandwich. The filet tip meal did not come with a salad and was almost $20.  That was pretty lame. We got our food and it was on dollar store plates and very sad looking.  The portions were small and the peppers, mushrooms and onions that were with my tips were overcooked and soggy and the steak was overcooked.  I was bummed. My husband was so confused with his sandwich.  It was a small piece of dry chicken with weird slaw, hot sauce and a HUGE scoop of peanut butter - the ingredients did not go together at all.  We would have told the waitress, but she didn't come back until we were almost done. I did ask for bread because I also remember it being awesome and should have came with my meal.  It was old and cold and was sitting in a sad basket wrapped with a old linen.  It was half a loaf of mini bread with no knife. We used our hands to share it.In short, this place has gone waaaaay down hill over the years and the owners don't seem to care. It's dirty, overpriced and the service is poor. I guess it is just another spot (like all the other bars in Lake Wylie) for locals to sit and drink outside. It's too bad, I remember when there would be a line out the door and inside and outside would be packed on the weekends and the food was really good. Nice location, but I will never go back again.One star!  Let me begin by saying I've been coming to this restaurant since it opened, sometime in early 90's.  It appears that the joint hasn't been remodeled or thoroughly cleaned since opening day.  The place is absolutely filthy.  Really had a hard time not just walking out, but I wasn't alone so I stuck it out.  Terrible atmosphere.  Very musty, all the decorations appear to be from the early 90's.  The windows are dirty.  The floors are dirty.  The doors are sticky.  You can tell that the place is wiped down but never deep cleaned.  So now to the food.  I had a Carolina burger. It was tasteless, unseasoned, and poorly made.  Tasted nothing like a Carolina burger should.  The slaw had carrots in it which is weird on a burger and I've never seen carrots in homemade burger cole slaw.  The chili was tasteless.  The bun was tasteless.  Bad all the way around.  The burger was low grade meat, more suited for McDonalds and truthfully tasted worse than a McDonalds burger but cost me 10.00.  What a sham.  That burger cost them 2.00 and they charged 9.99.  Which I'll gladly pay for a fresh ground beef patty.  Pitiful excuse for a restaurant. No leadership in this place.  I really don't understand this business plan because they are adjacent to some of the highest value homes in Charlotte.  Just clean the place and serve fresh food.  I'll never return.As a bar with a nice view of the Lake, it's not bad although the lake is way down at this point and a large amount of the grassy area around the restaurant were under two to six feet of water six months ago.Meet a former colleage from work for lunch today.  I had their version of a Cuban called a Pork Loin Sandwich.  Not bad except for the cole slaw.  I know cole slaw is a Carolina thiing but you don't have to put it on everything.  Otherwise it was excellent and the fries that came with it were pretty good as well.My friend  had a pound of wings with hot sauce and he really enjoyed them.Food was OK, not outstanding, the bar scene was good and the servers were outstanding. We ate at the bar on the outside deck and it was pleasant.  Warm but not too hot with a great view.

Restaurant name  Monty's Blue Plate Diner
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
Monty's is one of the many mind-boggling Food Fight restaurants that is a Madison favorite despite serving mediocre food. I've eaten one good dish here: the TNT BLT (tempeh and tomato). And the chocolate shake is good if you need to consume an extraordinary number of calories on any given day.The last time I went, I did so because a friend told me the restaurant is attempting to make a switch to more sustainability-conscious, organic food. I ordered chili that was pretty much inedible. On another night, my boyfriend ordered a soup that was, again, inedible. I can imagine that people like to come here because the restaurant resembles an old-school diner and has booths, which are fun for kids to sit in. But the food quality is generally average to poor. The brunch I've had is tasteless and limited, and you are not getting fresh eggs unless you order them over easy. The only reason I give Monty's two stars is because its pies are great. And once in a while, I can stomach a TNT BLT because someone I'm with persuades me to give Monty's one . . . more . . . try.Monty's has quickly become my "can you" place. What do I mean by that..."You know your chocolate malt pie... can you turn that into a shake?" YES"You know the fried onions that come on the open faced meatloaf sandwich... can you put those on a burger?" YES"You know the biscuit that comes with some breakfast items... can I swap my diner roll for a biscuit?" YESThe staff is extremely friendly, always up for great conversation and recently I've taken to sitting at the counter which is a blast... your meal comes with a free show!So when I say Monty's is my "can you" place, I mean it's a place that doesn't mind me being a brat. And if they ever say no? That'll be ok with me. I may go once a week instead of my typical 3-4 (seriously how does that happen?) but I'll still go!Ok, this is bad news (for me and my waistline)... Second visit to Monte's was 1/27/14 for "dinner," although I was there for some breakfast vittles.+ Breakfast ALL FREAKING DAY, EVERY FREAKING DAY - hip hip hooray+ Excellent variety of breakfast grub+ Reasonable prices+ Servers have been friendly, efficient, and professional - just the right "warmth"+ Atmosphere is classic diner; very familiar feel to it+ Obviously shares a connection with Hubbard Ave Diner (both are FF restaurants)+ Sweet Potato Hash: perfectly seasoned, nice slight char on the veggies, eggs were ever-so-slightly overcooked but still good+ Breakfast Burrito: I'm a sucker for these things; chorizo is just a touch greasy; left a little film in the mouth, but that's chorizo for you... + Good coffee, with speedy refillsI've heard the shakes and burgers are good; I'm too in love with the breakfast fare to venture to that side of the menu, but who knows... I'll give into temptation at some point, I'm sure.After this morning BK breakfast fiasco, I still wanted breakfast.  This place is like Campbell's soup good mmmm mmm mmmm. I had country breakfast plate eggs  and bacon cooked perfect. Don't judge but also had blueberry pancakes. My gf had the blue plate omelet( the yummy one with avacados). I can't say enough how great the food and service was. Love great diner's like this.

Restaurant name  Wilson's Bar-B-Q
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
I stopped by yesterday at around 5:30 with CM to grab some dinner after spending the afternoon at the Aviary.  I'd wanted to try Wilson's last weekend before a visit to the Mattress Factory, but wasn't able to because we lacked cash, and Wilson's is a cash only establishment.  This time, we came prepared with plenty of green, so we were able to get our BBQ bliss on.In case you don't notice the heady odor of smoked meat when approaching Wilson's, it literally hits you in the face as soon as you walk in.  I first inquired about the chicken, but was told by the gentleman working behind the counter (presumably Mr. Wilson) that they were out of it for the day.  Thus, CM and I decided to split a large plate of ribs (around $12), which comes with 6 bones.  Because we'd heard that Wilson's hot sauce is seriously hot, we ordered a mix of hot and mild sauce for the ribs.  For sides, we decided to order the collard greens and the potato salad ($1.34 each), and I got a can of iced tea, as well ($1).  Because he's still having some trouble breathing from his ongoing cold, CM requested that we get our items to go, so I obliged.After finding a picnic table in West Park commons with a little help from a local resident, we unpacked the food and dug in.  We first tried the ribs, and found them appropriately smoky and the right texture, with sufficient give but not falling apart.  The sauce was just the right level of spiciness to satisfy both of us, as well--spicy enough to provide a nice kick, but not so spicy as to be overwhelming.  After finishing the ribs, we both used the slices of white bread provided to soak up the remaining sauce.  As for the sides, they were clearly homemade and of good quality and flavor, though the potato salad was a bit mushier than I'm accustomed to, and the collards were a bit saltier than I'd like.Overall, we were quite pleased with the quality and amount of food that we received for the price that we paid (around $16).  Make no mistake: Wilson's is a hole in the wall, but in the best sense of the phrase--check it out for solid, unpretentious BBQ that hits the spot for a casual picnic lunch or dinner if you happen to be in the area.

Restaurant name  Peppi's

Review Text :
I finally tested Peppi's out last week in the Strip District on a Saturday afternoon.  Living in Squirrel Hill and going to school at CMU, I am a die-hard fan of Uncle Sam's subs, and I go there quite frequently.  I'm surprised that no one has compared Peppi's and Uncle Sam's because they are practically identical, minus Uncle Sam's throwing in free fries if you eat in.I ordered a cheesesteak ($7.22 w tax), after all of the cashiers agreed that it was one of the best sandwiches on the menu.  As promised, it was a delicious sandwich.  The bread was nice and fresh and the steak was good.  Additionally, the people working there were very friendly as well.  The portion was huge, and I got a meal and a snack out of my sub.If you are looking for a quick sit-down or to-go lunch, Peppi's is a great place in the Strip for just that.

Restaurant name  Ole Brass Rail

Review Text :
I remember driving by this bar a couple of years ago and laughing out loud because the parking lot was packed at 8am.  I was asking myself, who the HELL *are* these people, getting loaded this early?!Fast forward two years later, and I've become one of "those people"  Well, with the caveat that I'm not getting loaded.Now I figger that my excuse is about as good as they come.  I'm working nights from 6pm to 6am, and after putting in a 12 hour shift, sometimes a man wants to have a damn drink, get something to eat, read the newspaper, relax a bit.  This avoids the unwelcome alternative of "unwinding" by drinking at home alone at 7am,  which tends to generate feelings of being a total loser.So anyway, ye Old Brass Rail opens bright and early at 6am, which is perfect.  As with any bar opening at this hour, there is your contingent of old man alkeeholic regulars, but this particular place also seems to be popular with the nurses getting off the night shift at a nearby hospital.  They usually enter in groups of 2-4, ordering double long island ice teas, and getting their drink on in their scrubs.  Some of them are even cute.The service is attentive and low-key.  Drinks are cheap and there are several breakfast specials available for under $5.   The food is nothing amazing but it gets the job done and the price is definitely right.   The first time I walked out of there after paying $7 for breakfast with a tall  gin and grapefruit juice, I knew that I had found a winner.There is a smoking patio with misters, but much to my dismay I got bawled out one day for taking a plate of pancakes out there. APPARENTLY, there is no food served on the patio, nor is the consumption of food that you have brought out to the patio yourself tolerated.  The reason given was pretty lame too, it basically boiled down to the fact that they didn't want to deal with people bitching about smoke ruining their breakfast, or something, blah blah blah.   So far, that has been my only negative experience at this place.The joint could use face lift, like another reviewer mentioned, but doing so might erase some of its character.Just watch your step on the way out the door, there's a slight incline that's easy to get tripped up on. :-O  Regulars will back me up on this.

Review Text :
I've never had Cajun food in Louisiana so I can't make a comparison even if I wanted to, which I don't.  It seems a lot of people like to complain about ethnic food being Americanized or regional styles not living up to expectations.  We live in Phoenix people-Phoenix, AZ, USA, not Phoenix, Japan or Phoenix, New York.  I have eaten Mexican food in Kentucky of all places.  Was it the style of food I am used to being a native Arizonan?  No, but I can appreciate that it wasn't bad, just someone else's interpretation.So, the end result is I like Baby Kay's.  I've eaten here several times and never had a dish I didn't like, nor bad service.  I like that their hushpuppies actually have flavor beyond that of a wad of cornmeal.  I like the gumbo and jambalaya.  I tried the crawfish ettouffe and it was great.  I like that the potato salad is not swimming in some overly sweetened mayo concoction.So while it may or may not compare to your version of authentic Cajun cooking, it is still a great place for a meal.Oyster po'boy, bitches!  Thick, juicy hunks of oyster, lightly battered and fried, then put on a toasted hoagie roll.  Served with homemade potato chips, a pile of sweet pickle slices and a side of the remoulade sauce.  The sauce is what makes it!  It's a horseradish sauce and yummy!  I poured a bit of it over my sandwich.  It's obviously the specialty of the house, because our server asked each of us if we wanted it on the side.Oysters were big, juicy and firm, not too much so, though.  Nothing like oysters that aren't edible.  I've had them elsewhere and it's really disgusting.I just burped and it tasted like the po'boy.  All the boys at work are jealous.

Review Text :
I am confused. I am baffled. I am in shock. I am disappointed.  When I read the reviews I was a little surprised but I figured somehow I must have looked over this place after all these years and I was actually regretting it!  Now...not so much. I quickly realized there was a reason I grew up right around the corner yet never visited this place.  I realized there was a reason I never even stepped foot in this place on a lunch break while working at the neighboring Food Lion as a squeaky teenager with braces. Back then I thought Ragu was gourmet so I wasn't even picky but STILL knew to stay away from Juliana's  There is a reason why our Italian family of 7 never bothered ordering from here even though it was cheap and close by!  You have to realize this was before the restaurant scene really even popped off in Charlotte!! There were no options!  Uptown was downtown, the arboretum was for the wealthy and Ballantyne didn't exist.  But still....Juliana's was never an option....now I see WHY!!We opened the door and immediately fell back into 1973.  The diner feel of this place gave me the creeps and the whole restaurant turned to stare as we entered.  It was awkwardly quiet and just didn't have a comfortable feel AT ALL.  I wanted to leave from the moment I stepped in but I figured I needed to get over myself and give it a try.  Sometimes the best food comes out of little hole in the wall restaurants.  I wasn't expecting much but I realize decor is not the only thing that matters.We decided to stick with the absolute basic.  I ordered Spaghetti and meatballs and my husband ordered the chicken parm 12 inch sub.  My husband isn't as picky as I am so I was counting on him to enjoy this sub.  It is pretty hard to mess up a chicken parm sub.My pasta came out and all I can tell you is that the sauce was brown.  It looked like gravy.  When I mixed it in with the spaghetti it somehow just vanished so it was basically like eating noodles with a hint of brown gravy.  It was the most disgusting thing I have ever tasted.  I took one bite of the meatball and thought I was going to throw up.  It was atrocious.  It was spongey and tasted like deer meat.  It was so gross.  My husband's chicken parm sub had the same doo-doo brown gravy on it and the chicken was like rubber.  Literally.  He could hardly bite through it.  When he said he couldn't eat this sub, I KNEW it was bad.  He eats anything.  I for darn sure wasn't eating my dish so we just sat their staring at each other.  I forgot to mention the salad and texas toast that was served with the meal...the salad was frozen iceburg with nothing else and the toast was a piece of lilly white bread with some butter and garlic slapped on it.  BLLLLEH!!!!Eventually the waitress made her way over to us and we weren't sure what to say but I can tell you I have only not been able to eat a meal due to COMPLETE dissatisfaction twice in my whole life.  The waitress noticed that we didn't eat our meals and asked if we wanted a box to go.  Um, WOW.  No, we want to just get out of here.  We asked for our check and told her we weren't really satisfied but that we didn't want to make a big deal, no need for managers, etc.  Well, one of the "managers" (son to the woman who owns and cooks) came over.  He offered us anything else off the menu to replace our meals.  We didn't want anything else from this dump.  We wanted to just LEAVE and go eat.  We were starving and on a time crunch.  Long story short--They made us pay for the meal that we didn't even touch.  The owner came out and was extremely nasty.  She said she posted that they do not refund for food.  She then pointed to this itty bitty note on her cash register.  She said she can't please everyone's taste buds so she is not going to refund anyone.  What?  So does this happen often enough that you have to have a disclaimer on your food?  That is TERRIBLE servie for a small mom and pop, or just mom shop.  It was like they were used to people not liking their food so they were prepared to argue their point.  IT was bizarre.  I don't understand that concept.  They said you can order a pizza or something else so they are still losing money by having to make a whole other meal!  Either way, it was their approach and the fact that the food was absolutely disgusting.  I would NEVER want to support this place, local or not.I asked them where they were from because no one that was born and raised in Italy would have created the mess that they did.  They were actually greek.  I suppose they just have a different way of preparing Italian food because it was NOT authentic.I looked back at those who offered such stellar reviews and realized that most of the people were from random towns/areas.  Maybe they haven't been exposed to the real deal in terms of Italian food so somehow this place was okay to them.  Not me.  I'm telling you...If you love Italian food and have had real authentic Italian food...DO NOT GO HERE.  End of story

It's simple............. I don't believe I've given 5-stars to an Italian restaurant since Yelping, until now! I can only hope that if you're in Phoenix, and you try any of their locations, your meal will be as great as our's.And for us, the revelation of why this meal was sooo good, went back to the source; fresh ingredients. And how do we know that Tutti Santi cooks with fresh ingredients, like fresh picked basil from their own garden? Because Nina, the 80 year "young" owner shared that, and a few other secrets with us, at our table.  It might have been the comment that the gnocchi was absolutely as good as my wife's....... and THAT COMMENT was made in front of my wife! The word must've gone from our lips, to the server, to the kitchen......... to Nina herself! Because from then on, it was more than just a great Italian dinner experience. It was a great Italian dinner experience with "Nina." She left the kitchen, and came to our table, sharing some cooking, and life, experiences, and also sharing how she comes into the restaurant as early as 4am, just to make their fresh pastas..... and that great gnocchi. I couldn't believe her energy and spunk! Waiter........ I'm having whatever Nina's having for breakfast!!!And yes, we started by ordering their "famous gnocchi appetizer." You've got to order the gnocchi; either the appetizer or the entree! Enough said on that. We then followed with one of the specials; Penne pasta with chicken and Italian sausage in a pink sauce. It was DELICIOUS... and I could taste the very traditional Italian sausage, which was perfectly seasoned. And the chicken? It was white meat strips that had an incredibly fresh taste, and wonderful texture. Our other dish was their eggplant parm. And just how good was that? My wife commented that it melted in her mouth; the best version of eggplant parm she's ever had. And it came with a very generous serving of spaghetti pomadoro. The pomodoro is a basic red sauce, and in this case, a very "Roma tomato" fresh tasting sauce. And because I asked about their meat sauces, the waiter brought me a soup bowl filled with the Bolognese sauce, which I liberally put on both their garlic bread and some of my penne pasta. That could've been a meal in itself. Nina's kitchens prove the adage that, "...there's no substitute for quality and freshness!" And she also proved that her affection for great food extends to her affection for her patrons, as she brought us a huge serving of her "in-house" tiramisu. It was such a well balanced dessert; "almost as sweet as Nina!" Enough said.

This place is all about the seafood.  Don't roll up to the Fish Market expecting a cool place to hang or a hip crowd.  No problem on the crowd...lots of folks in a pretty basic seafood restaurant, chowing on the best seafood I've had in the valley so far.  The hip is not here.  Not until I showed up with my wife Audrey W to meet Kevin H and Marian H.  You could actually see the coolness spread around the restaurant when we walked in...a subtle ripple, sort of like a gentle wave at a spring training game.So I arrived in Phoenix from Boston and have high standards for seafood.  I had been craving fish & chips for awhile and decided to give Fish Market a try.  I got a combo-fish, scallops and prawns.  The batter was light and not very oily...+1.  The prawns were very tender and done to perfection..+1.  The scallops were tender, sweet and juicy...+1.  The fish was done just right as well although it was not the haddock or even cod I am accustomed to in Boston.Everyone else was pleased with their food as well.  I will be trying other seafood places in the valley but I'll keep Fish Market in mind as a standby.

Fatso's is great!  It is a small pizza joint, and while it isn't fancy or glamorous by any stretch of the imagination, it is the perfect place to grab some wings, pizza and beer.  We live close by and come to Fatso's often.  There are several things that keep us coming back.  The Gus....so simple, yet so delicious.  The perfectly crusty bread loaded with sharp cheddar, lean roast beef and fresh jalapenos is undeniably one of favorite sandwiches of all time (check it out Nader!).  Their honey barbecue wings are awesome.  The sauce is made in-house and it is remarkable.  Think sweet, smokey barbecue with a spicy kick.  The wings are baked, an added bonus for me.  The thin crust pizza is good, but don't go in expecting a New York Style pie.  Add fresh garlic to your pizza of choice and you will never want to eat a garlic-less pizza again!Fatso's has a surprisingly large selection of beers on tap and a number of bottled craft beers (Stone, Rogue, etc.).  Lastly, treat yourself to a Fat Cookie.  It is100% worth the thousands of crunches you'll need to do to work it off!

Review Text :
A work associate and I came here for lunch one day a couple weeks back.  It is super close to the office and I have heard pretty great things about Vincent's of Green Tree from others and of course Double M on the X gives them plenty of raves while backing up his story with "When I wasn't on a diet." We arrived shortly after noon.  The place is small, and it was busy.  There is a small bar but we opted for one of the two open tables left.  We were waited on quickly, a couple waters for each of us, then after perusing the menu we decided to split a pie.  We ordered the Italian SteakFresh Italian steak, green peppers, onions, mushrooms, cheddar, mozzarella, and provolone cheese.  He also ordered a cup of Italian Wedding Soup.  Now I am not the biggest pizza lover.  I like pizza, but typically I am disappointed in one way or another.  So that being said I thought that I would probably think it was pretty typical, however I was definitely wrong.  I can't say this is the best pie I have had locally but it is up there in the top 5.  Even with all the toppings the pizza stood nice and firm.  The crust was delightful and I don't typically like a thicker crust.  I would say their crust is probably traditional, I prefer thin, but this was so light and airy that the texture was about perfect.  I am not sure about the steak they use.  Couldn't tell with the array of toppings if it was more of a steakum type of meat or not, but together it all tasted delightful.    Between the two of us we finished the medium pie no problem.  My only suggestion to people coming here for lunch is it is busy and you will wait.  So if you only have 30 minutes for lunch, I would call ahead, because it took almost 40 minutes from the time of order to get our pie.  Otherwise bon appétit!

Review Text :
7/31 - Move to Bloomfield.8/1 - Go to Groceria Italiana.8/3 - Go to Groceria Italiana.8/4 - Go to Groceria Italiana.8/5 - Go to Groceria Italiana.It's just that damn good. This place is what it would be like if your Italian grandmother opened a grocery store near you, so that you could still enjoy her homemade goodness while you're away. Everything I've had from the hot foods table is phenomenal -- the oft-touted meatball sandwiches, the eggplant parm, the stuffed peppers (brought 'em home to my dad dahn in Washpa, and he said it was THE best stuffed pepper he'd ever had), the chicken cacciatore, the Italian sausage, the rotini with meat sauce, and the pepperoni rolls. OH, the pepperoni rolls! They're big, they're stuffed with quality pepperoni and cheese, they're crispy on the bottom, and have what I consider the determining factor in what makes a pepperoni roll awesome -- tons of burnt cheese crusted on the outside. (Side note: If you want a pepperoni roll and are in Bloomfield, come here; don't go to Pizza Italia.) But, it doesn't stop there. It's easy to walk straight over to the hot foods and ignore the rest of the store, but don't. The freezers are packed with good food glory! Grab a bag of the frozen, homemade gnocchi and a quart of the marinara sauce (kept in the cooler with salads), and you've got an incredible meal in 5 minutes flat. The gnocchi are perfection -- dense, yet light, and the flavor screams, "I'm homemade! Boxed, pre-packaged gnocchi ain't got nothin' on me!" I'm going to buy 4 more bags of them today. They also have frozen, homemade pierogies (haven't tried 'em yet), pastas, sausages, Italian ice, and -- drumroll, please -- tiramisu. There's a sign on the front door that says, "We have the best tiramisu!" and they are not lyin'. It's phenomenal. Because of that, it's also super dangerous stuff. Diet-ruining, can't-stop-eating kinda stuff.They have a nice li'l selection of pantry stuff, too -- quality olive oils, vinegars, anchovies, olives, spices, mayo, etc., as well as a small refrigerated section with milk, and some local produce, like lettuce, cukes, tomatoes, etc. This is definitely a place you can pop into to try and avoid a Giant Eagle run!Last, but not least, something good to know: I asked one of the guys working there if they had certain days of the week designated for certain dishes, and he said, "No, the two ladies just come in early and see what's in the kitchen and make whatever they feel like making that day!" I love that. Somebody's grandma really is making this food, and you can tell it's all made with lots and lots of love. Groceria Italiana, I will be patronizing you for years to come!I visited after work last Fri. to pick up dinner.  I considered getting the raviolis, but decided against it because (1) I already had some frozen raviolis in the freezer (though I'm sure theirs are much better); (2) They're not cheap, at $7ish per box; (3) I wanted a hot take-out dinner.  Since I'd heard good things about the pepperoni rolls but had never tried a pepperoni roll, I asked the guy working behind the counter if they had any.  He confirmed that they did, so I bought one of them plus a tiramisu, which came to about $12.Upon arriving home, I decided to heat up the pepperoni roll in the toaster oven.  It was excellent, with light and fluffy but substantial bread, plenty of pepperoni slices, and a layer of mozzarella cheese.  While I liked the flavor, it occurred to me that some marinara sauce would make it even more flavorful, so I heated up some in the microwave and proceeded to dip the roll in the sauce as I ate it.  (As a newbie to pepperoni rolls, I don't know if this is a common practice.)  Ideally, I should have asked if they had any marinara sauce for dipping, since a higher-quality marinara sauce would have been even better.  Oh, well--I'll do that next time.The tiramisu was even better than the pepperoni roll.  I've had tiramisu a couple of times, but I don't seek it out since I'm not a huge fan of coffee-flavored desserts.  This tiramisu is addictive, however, and the espresso-soaked ladyfingers had me wanting more every time I ate a piece.  Even if you're not a big tiramisu fan, I'd suggest trying their version--it's tiramisu the way tiramisu should taste.Perhaps the most notable thing about this store is that the majority of products appear to be homemade (i.e., non-commercial).  Aside from the items I've already mentioned, they have an assortment of cheeses, pasta, and pizzelles.  I look forward to visiting again and partaking of some more Italian goodness soon!EDIT: I tried the sun dried tomato basil ravioli, and they were absolutely delicious. Just make sure to bake them according to the directions--the reviewer who said they fell apart on him obviously tried to boil them.  Looking forward to trying more delicious flavors of raviolis soon!I have been eyeing up Groceria Italiana for months, but I had to wait for the right moment.  I knew it was going to be an amazing little store, and sometimes I start weeping when I am really happy... which is awkward in a little grocery store.I finally got a box of the Gorgonzola artichoke ravioli.  They weren't cheap, but they were AMAZING.  I want to try all of the flavors.  The inside was rich and delicious, and the noodle was homemade perfection.I really want to try the Tiramisu, but I'm turned off by the fact that it is frozen.  Fresh would be better.The actual store has everything you could ever want: meats, cheese, prepared foods, and specialty Italian items.  There is also a public lot next door, which is convenient.  The employees are helpful as well.  Check it out ASAP.

It's Monday night; I'm hung over, tired, and have been wearing the same two-week disposable contact lenses for so long that the calcium deposits are creating white blind-spots on my periphery. Who do I call? Ho Ho Cherry House. It's Tuesday night; I have a six-pack of PBR in the fridge and four episodes of the CW's break-out hit Arrow to catch up on... Who do I call? Ho Ho Cherry House. It's Wednesday night; I'm supposed to be meeting a coworker for trivia at some dive-bar in Ballantyne, but it's that sort of awkward cold outside where it's too chilly for shorts but not quite cool enough for long pants. Plus, I don't have any clean socks. So I blow it off and call Ho Ho Cherry House. It's Thursday night; my ladyfriend and I have a hundred bucks worth of unassembled Galaxy Squad LEGO kits stacked up on the coffee table and the latest Channing Tatum action flick pirate-bay'd. Who do we call? Ho Ho Cherry House. It's Friday night; I'm supposed to be meeting up with my friends to hang out around a fire pit and drink beer and talk about life, but I'm "feeling kind of sick" or "I'm really busy" or "Really? I didn't get that text". Instead, I'm calling Ho Ho Cherry House. It's Saturday night. AJ and S are coming over to drink gin and play old school Mario with the lady and me. We wanna grub up but AJ and I are unsuccessful in convincing the women to cook us something. So we call Ho Ho Cherry House. It's Sunday evening; the Panthers are playing a late-game at San Francisco. I have a free-pizza coupon from Papa Johns stuck to the front of the fridge. But who do I call? Ho Ho Cherry House. The point is - no matter the day, no matter the situation, the only reasonable answer to your desire for Chinese delivery is Ho Ho Cherry House. Sesame chicken. Shrimp fried rice. Egg foo young. Crab Rangoons. Those gnarly little dumpling things. A bucket of General Tso's. A freakin' boat-load of Lo Mein. A lil Mei Fun to keep things crazy. It's ALL GOOD. Seriously, if you're in their delivery radius (from 7th street), hit this place up. It's very consistently good, the delivery drivers are friendly and professional, and their website has super-convenient online ordering so that you can get through 90% of the experience without having to speak to another human. On those nights where you just wanna stay in, be lazy, and gorge yourself on something cheap, delicious, and oh-so-not-good for you, Ho Ho Cherry House is it. Let me emphasize one thing: The name of this restaurant is HO. HO. CHERRY. HOUSE. An inspiring entrepreneur selected for the name of his or her establishment, Ho Ho Cherry House. This is a real thing that is happening around us that we can all be a part of. No joke. It's Chinese takeout that tastes like Chinese takeout. It's predictably, unspectacularly exactly what it's supposed to be. Very few things in life infuse me with as much pure joy and anticipation as someone uttering the words...Ho. Ho.Cherry.Houuuuuuussssseeeeee.

Review Text :
This is one of those places you desperately want to love... the decor is amazing, some strange, psychedelic mixture of saloon meets slightly-cheesy italian... the waitstaff are a bunch of sweethearts, mostly old ladies...and it's been here for something like 60 years, pumping out pizzas and pasta and texas toa-er-garlic bread. But you can't really, because its pretty pricey-- and the food is bad. The combination kills it for you. Your pizza comes out, at a whopping $12 for a smallish two topping, and the crust is Elio's, or something, a poured batter-like pie shell texture crust. The sauce is hardly there, and the cheese is so plasticized, it stretches for feet. Your "greek salad" is $6 and is half a head of iceburg with oddly-flavored diced beets, a small sprinkling of feta, two tomato quarters, and two small olives. I've given it two tries, maybe the third will be different... but I get the feeling the recipes and style of cooking happening here haven't changed in 20 years, and are unlikely to in the near future.

Restaurant name  Don Jose Mexican Food
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
The first thing you need to know about Don Jose is that it's closed. It shut down after 40-plus years in December of '07. The second thing you need to know is that Don Jose was the greatest Mexican Food restaurant on God's green earth. Oh, you could quibble with me about our definitions--what constitutes true Mexican food, etc, etc. Don Jose was, by most standards, a dive--a simple, no-frills, insanely inexpensive dining experience in a 60-year old former IHOP. The style of Mexican food they served was what we rare Arizona natives call "Sonoran", but what some others call "gringo"--cheese crisps instead of "quesidillas", hard-shell tacos and tostadas, etc, etc. There were no sprouts or carrots or squid or catfish or organic cage-free okra on the menu; the burritos contained shredded beef or beans, lots of cheese, and they had a side menu of American favorites--burgers, grilled cheese, fries, the works. The interior was decorated on a $10 budget circa 1964 and it stayed that way until they closed the joint; the red rotary phone still hangs behind the huge 1940s cash register. It didn't matter what you ordered. It was all staggeringly good. There was no single item on the menu more than $4. The salsa was a mind-altering trip to an altered dimension where everything was made of delicious. The week they closed, they had lines around the block and wait times pushing three hours. I ate 36 cheese tacos in the space of 12 days. And 12 cheese crisps. And 8 burritos. And 20 bowls of chips. I'm still on the treadmill working it off, my arteries may never recover and I don't care. When they closed I felt like somebody in my family had died. Sadly, the owner decided to retire to spend more time with his family. What am I, chopped liver? I ate there for 25 years! I AM family, dammit!I swiped a menu. Sometimes, late at night, I clutch it to my chest and sob. Maybe I can find a therapist who serves cheese tacos.Your only other alternative for truly spectacular Mexican food in the Phoenix area is La Perla in Glendale--another classic family-owned place that opened in the 40s (and honestly, far more authentic and flavorful--but for me, not quite "home".) Go there at once. Quick, before it's replaced by some horrible strip-mall fresh-Mex garbage.

Do you love big sloppy pieces of pork fat covered in barbecue sauce? If so please come here!!I'll be as nice as I can since I've only been here once and only had one item.   I had open faced pork sandwich with a side of coleslaw.   The pork was sliced thin but was 50% fat. and no, not just one piece of pork but the entire plate of it, yuck!They must have forgot to add the dressing to the coleslaw because it was bone dry.  Yummy, I love raw plain cabbage! How did they know?I'll give them the benefit of the doubt and say I just got a bad hunk of meat because there is no way this place could serve food like that and stay in business.  If they change their name to "My Big Plate of Pork Fat with Sauce" it would better suit the meal I was served.---Re-reading my own review and now I'm pissed that I didn't send it back, I should have damn it!Now I'm not from Kansas City but I started eating meat again awhile ago and I'm pretty picky about what kind of meat I put in my mouth believe it or not! I havent had a pork sandwich in a few years and I usually hate teh pork!! The way this was cooked, seriously it was not fatty or I never would have polished the whole thing off. I liked it that much! I have no qualms with throwing shitty food in the garbage where it belongs. The taste was really good with just the right smokey flavor the meat was tender and not dry. I was so full I didnt even touch my sides so I cant say anything about the fries, onion rings, or slaw. It was a bit pricey but this totally hit the spot for me the other night....that is all!There's a huge banner out front proclaiming :" UNDER NEW MANAGEMENTTHE OLD OWNERS ARE BACK", but I didn't ask "for how long?", so can't say how that pertains to the less than stellar reviews showing up here.I got solid 4 star food and service.I definitely recommend choosing "Burnt Ends" as your meat!It is a mix of pork and beef brisket, but cut into hunks instead of shredded.  It's not burnt as the clever name implies, but the chunks give you plenty of crusty "BARK" full of smoky flavor.   My usual habit of mixing the sweet and hot sauces being offered worked out perfectly.The amount of fat in the meat was absolutely appropriate, unlike other reviewers have said.  It's needed for flavor, tenderness, and juiciness, which my sammich had all three of.If I went for BBQ and got 100% lean meat, I'd complain!!!!On a bizarre note, their fries were the exact taste and consistency of McDonald's fries!  Maybe a good thing to some people, maybe even great to some, but if they're not going to be the thick homecut wedges I'd prefer, then I'd say they should aim more for Wendy's fries 8^ )Service was great.  The decor was clean and full of stylized jazz musician paintings and sculptures.My only gripe is that I hate menus with rules, and this one was interspersed with the classic "No Substitutions" for the lunch special, and a few others.  No biggie, i understand they need to try to control some costs, and i'll be back regardless.Old owners are back and by that I mean the original owners from back when they occupied the Chino's building. Lunch here with Ryan C proved to be most excellent. I had the pulled pork large size not the smaller lunch size. They serve it with frys and pickle slices. The sesame studded bun was large enough and dense enough to hold in the mound of meaty goodness. No fat in this one folks. The frys were forgettable and the pickles had bite. The sauce I used was the spicy and it was perfect. More of a KS style, ketchup based sauce. The service was attentive but slow as they had a server call in sick. I would rather have slow service then a sick server any day. The guy next to us said he drives from Sun City just to eat here. That means he passes El Paso, Thee Pits, Shanes RibShack Just to get here. I tried a bite of the burnt ends... I love it. More like a tougher chunk not a pulled type but man there was a ton of flavor. I burped the smoke at dinner. YEAAHH!! Price was good, place was clean and people seemed happy.

Review Text :
If liking Melting Pot is wrong, I don't want to be right. Listen, I know Melting Pot is a chain and it's pricey...waahhhh wahhh. Guess what? I love melty cheese. I love melty chocolate. I don't *mind* throwing a few veggies into a crockpot of chicken broth and hanging out for a little while. Plus, they have a decent drink list and great variety of offerings & meal combinations. The service at this particular Melting Pot is typically solid and they are great at handling substitutions. Don't like broccoli? They'll sub out for another veggie. Scallops get you down? Sub in some bird. Oh, and I haven't mentioned it yet, but the Green Goddess cream cheese/sour cream/herby sauce for the veggies is so good I want to marry it.Whether you want just a cheese fondue or you're going full on three course, Melting Pot is solid & delicious.I wish that I could give The Melting Pot more than 5 stars because they made our company holiday party stress free and absolutely perfect!!I have put together a number of company parties and they are always stressful and something horrific normally goes on. Tracy (rest manager) made the entire process a breeze, from start to finish. She even let me taste test the wines we were serving. That was a fun afternoon ;-)The food was amazing, as usual, and the service was outstanding. I would highly recommend the spinach artichoke cheese fondue and the yin and yang chocolate fondue! Amazing!!!!I would highly recommend The Melting Pot to anyone looking to host a holiday party or really any type of party for that matter. It is also a really intimate and romantic place to take someone on a date.

Along with Karri, I would give them 2.5 stars if I could.I had a business lunch here the other day.  Time was limited and it made sense to grab lunch at the Hilton where several of the parties were staying. I played it safe with a chicken quesadilla.  It was better than average for about 10 bucks.  It came with generous sides of guacamole and sour cream.The service was good.  Prompt and efficient without being obtrusive.  Rimrock Bar & Grille is not a place I would ever seek out but safe and decent food for a hotel restaurant.

Per dollar, your not going to find any better food close by.  I'm not saying literally "Woohoo! As good as it gets!"  But, on that side of town I don't know of any other place you can get full and have a beer for under $10.It is a Deli/Grille with beer.  Pretty straight forward.  You grab your drink while waiting in line to place an order, then you order at the counter.  You walk around the side to pay and they give you a number.  Put that number on your table, and your food will be delivered shortly.  No wait service, just fast service.  I prefer eating out on the patio if there is space available.There is quite a variety of choices.  From burgers to french dips.  Bratwurst to meatball subs.  Salads, stuffed potatoes, and even some vegetarian options.  I've tried it all and never had a bad meal.I know this review sounds more like an ad for the place, but I really have nothing bad to say.  Its a chill little spot that puts out great food at a reasonable price.  Kind of unheard of on park rd.

Pull up to your spot, order your food, and it is brought out to your car. All the while 50's - classic rock tunes are playing over the speaker system. As far as fast food chains go this is one of the better ones. Nothing like feeling a touch of nostalgia of a drive-in joint where you can sit in your car with the windows open in beautiful weather and have the food brought to you. Happy hour from 2-4 where all the drinks are half price! Can't beat a Big Gulp sized Grape Slushie and Blue Coconut Slushie for only $1 each! Along with some tastily seasoned popcorn chicken, a ranch chicken wrap, and perfectly crispy tater tots this was a winning quick lunch!Yum - tater tots!Seems so seemless here. Pull up, press the red button, place your order, and within minutes it is brought to your car with a smile. If you want to eat outside there are some tables and chairs on a small patio in the front. How can anyone not like this?Grape slushie....Mmmmmm.I can't imagine making it through a hot summer without my Route 44 Diet Cherry Limeades to keep me cool, so I'm a frequent visitor to the Sonic Drive-In back home.  While visiting Phoenix over the July 4th week, this Sonic, on the North side of E. McDowell between N. 48th and N. 51st, became my go-to drink restaurant of choice.What is unique about this particular Sonic is that there is a drive through, but no drive through window.  Feel free to ponder this for a moment or two.  There is a menu and a speaker where you can order whatever you like, and then you pull forward to... a solid wall on the side of the building.  No window to hand them your cash, and - most distressing of all - no window where they can hand me my humongous frosty beverage.  Well, okay, I did eventually receive my beverage as one of their servers walked out the front door and handed it to me where I tentatively pulled up to the edge of the curb.  Now, I know what you're thinking - Sonic is basically a drive up restaurant where they park and bring your food TO YOU, so why would I insist on driving through?  None of your beeswax, buster, I just do.  In addition to driving up and parking to order, there are plenty of outdoor tables, most with shade, where you can also sit, order, and enjoy your food or beverages.So, do whatever your little heart desires: park and sit in your car, park and sit at the tables, or order at the drive through and act really confused when you can't find the drive through window.  Just make sure you try the cherry limeade - trust me on this one.

My daughter and I sort of stumbled on this place a couple of weeks ago.  We were at the Ulta just around the corner and she said she was hungry and she LOVES pizza.  We have been here twice as of this writing.  The second time around was "Kids Eat Free" night.  That is Wednesay for those of you with kids and it's a good deal.  I will eventually put together a list of Kids Eat Free places in the area.  For now let me tell you about NYPD.....The pizza is a winner!  Nice crust, great topppings!  They use paper thin slices of sausage instead of hunks of sausage.  The flavore is great too.  My daughter had a slice of black olive pizza and they were very generous with the olives....she loved it!  I have had the ceaser and the house salads and both were good and fresh.  So for the Kids Eat Free night adults need to order an entree (I think this includes a whole pizza too, not sure though) There were several things to choose from including cheese ravioli, baked ziti, and  lasagne.  I chose the lasagne and it was delish!  Piping hot with melted mozeralla over the top, I could not stop eating it!!  The flavors melded together nicely and it reminded me of my Mom's lasagne.  And did I mention the bread......OMG!!  The little ibites of heaven are sooooo good!!  I could have eaten ten of them!!  They are homemade, the real deal, yeasty goodness!!  Warm and just a little chewy, the flavor was amazing!!  Oh and the Desert Flower Ice Tea.....so refreshing!!!  I keep thinking about it, that's how good it is!!Try the canollis.....you won't be disappointned.  Kids get an ice cream sundae with their meal.  On our first visit Lori, our server, was a real sweetheart.  She gave me some coupons and signed me up for the email list.  And on our next visit , Jessica was awesome and attentive too!This is a small place but they also have an outdoor patio with misters.  The bar is tiny, probably seats 10.  Flat screen for watching the D'backs and some good beers on tap, along with Happy Hour specials makes this a great place!!  This will be somewhere we will frequent!!  Thanks NYPD!!!First time everrrrrr that I wish yelp had a half star. The pizza is great. The wings are good. The service is awful. That combination = 3.5 stars.I was in the area and wanted to try more places that served wings after my awesome luck at Long Wong's. NYPD has an "express lunch" area which has a different menu than the normal dine-in menu. I went with a sicilian slice (already cooked and on display) and 6 wings. There was only one other table (2 people) in the lobby, so I figured I'd get my food within a reasonable amount of time.  I waited over 30 minutes to get that very simple dish... and it came with one celery stick. I asked for more celery, so the waitress brought out two celery sticks... really?I would eat here again, but only through delivery.

Wow, so this is the mecca of Chinese food in Phoenix? I mean don't get me wrong, I had some enjoyable items, but this is the Macayo's of Chinese restaurants. Undaring dishes with expected flavors delivered witha reasonable price. Now, mind you there is a hell-a-handsome tattooed waiter, who while I'm waiting for my to go food, I do the blue steel, eye lash flicker while I'm puckering up my lips look. While I'm sure I think I look hot and flirty, he and the rest of the staff are hurling up the mid afternoon dim sum. I'm just saying so often the famous favorite that's been around forever can be stale and uninventive. But on a Sunday, the pork lo mein, crab puffs and broccoli and beef nicely soak up the cosmo overdose I suffered at the hands of the previous night bartender who overserved me. The nerve. Chow Mein yelpers!Uh, 10 minutes to cook up egg flower soup, house chicken, and honey walnut prawns?  Serious?!  I don't think I'd want to sit down and eat there; it seemed a little depressing, way too warehouse-like (and crappy warehouse-like, not a good warehouse-like).Food?  Not bad ... the walnut prawn dish was great, huge prawns.  House chicken, not so great.  And the egg flower soup was pretty good, but nothing special.  Overall, pretty much your standard chinese joint, and standard chinese joints are awesome, so I'll definitely go back ... did I mention the walnut shrimp was awesome?Thank you David and Lisa S for introducing us to China Chli this past Friday night!We're always on the lookout for good Chinese in the Valley, and now we have another option (not too far from home) with China Chili.  I didn't expect CC to be such a large restaurant, and they were hopping to boot!  The atmosphere was welcoming - casual and old school; I especially love the disco ball in the main dining room.  The servers are serious and efficient, perhaps because they don't speak much English, but with so many customers, it works out fine... I imagine most people are there for the food anyways.So without further adieu, here's what we ordered for our family-style dinner:-Pot Stickers (I didn't have these but everyone else did and enjoyed them!)-Sizzling Rice Soup-Honey Walnut Prawns-Sichuan Style String Beans (we ordered with no pork and extra spicy thanks to a tip I found in Julie P's yelp review)-House Chow Fun Noodles-One of their house special steak dishes (I think it was Sizzling Black Pepper Beef in a dark sauce).Yes, I know, that's a lot of food for four people but we did have plenty of leftovers and I liked everything that I ate!Thank you -  (Xièxiè) - China Chili, David and Lisa, for a memorable meal!  I look forward to returning soon to try some of my other Chinese favorites!This is an excellent restaurant with very tasty unique dishes. Why am I giving it 5 stars? My mom said that she really enjoyed her meal, and was the best Asian dinner she's ever had. I was glad to hear that because I liked my food too! Although this restaurant is called China Chili, it takes its inspiration from Singapore and Malaysian influences. The egg rolls were even different. I was pleased to see that they use rice wrapper instead of the thick flour kind that most Chinese restaurant use. I don't really like those because they are too thick! Also, being a vegetarian, I was also very impressed with the vegetable selection here. My roommate ordered the Ma Po Tofu. I ordered the Tofu with green string beans, and my mom ordered the cashew chicken. The dishes were prepared to a high standard and served in good-sized portions. The service here was quick and friendly, and the prices were very reasonable. Will be back again. :-)The orange chicken is great. This place is always packed.I went here for my friend's graduation dinner.  We were served the traditional and authentic 10-course banquet-style dinner.  I didn't even know this place existed until that night!  The food is pure Hong Kong style cooking without the unnecessary frills --- just the way I like it!  The food comes hot and fresh and the wait stuff is friendly.  I can't remember every single dish that was served as it was an extremely festive night with lots of loud talking and cheers but I do recall the roasted duck and steamed fish in soy sauce with ginger and onions being amongst my favorite.  Come for the delicious food and not the atmosphere because this place isn't that cute.  ;DBomb!! Bomb orange chicken... Not like weirdMc nuggets covered in sauce. We order it extra spicy Szechuan beef so soBomb egg rolls Bomb pot stickers Bomb spicy mustard

I'm pissed. How can you just stop making grilled cheese? Its bread and cheese. HOW? You have bread, and you have cheese, but you cannot make a grilled cheese?Also, why does it have to be 400 degrees? I know you have A.C. This is AZ in the summer. It's hot. Turn it on.I don't have a really good basis to draw this conclusion because I rarely order this drink, but your dirty vodka martini is quite possibly the worst I have ever tasted. I had to eat a cheese stick with each bite just to stomach it.Your tater tots were good and my blue moon was reasonably priced. At least you have that going for you.This Hooters definitely improved after the remodeling, and it is a good place for simple to grab a sandwich, beer. and/or wings served by hotties in bikinis while watching a game on the multiple TVs.  I know that Hooters is supposed be famous for its wings as well as its female servers with big boobs, but I've never been very impressed with the wings.  The boobs on the other hand.... well, you know! HOOTY-WHO! ;-)I love Hooter's!!!!No, no, not the restaurant...it's really not the best dining experience, from a "good food" perspective. Mr. Hooter founded his establishment (Hooter's) on the premise that a few chickens losing their wings so that we can happily dine on them and wash them down with beer is a good thing:)It probably is a good thing (chickens don't really need their wings...even the free range clucker's can't fly:), things are just not particularly well executed at Hooters. Maybe it's the boobs who bought the place from Mr. Hooter that aren't living up to expectations.Still, the patrons were at Hooter's in force yesterday afternoon.What keeps them coming in droves?There must be something that keeps the clients (erstwhile diners?) coming in...could it be the charitable causes (I surmised that it's something about saving owls) that Mr. Hooter supported? I understand that Hooter's is all about support!Maybe it's the extraordinarily loud, yet incomprehensible music coming from the mis-synchronized speakers dotting the ceiling of Hooter's. I did notice that servers (all of whom seem to be young ladies in the full bloom of young lady-hood) all seem to kind of "groove" to the music, so they must like it:)Maybe it's the comforting bosom of Hooter's "sports bar" décor (funny signs, racks and racks of sports memorabilia, posters, etc., on the walls) that the Hooters client base yearns for. Nice artwork!Hard to say. I did notice that most of the diners were male, mid 30's to 60's and just sort of stared, glassy eyed (at the servers, not the food). That may help explain things.The Beautiful Carin called, out of the blue, and asked me out for lunch today:)What a nice surprise for me:)It was a perfect day for lunch, because I was ready to get out of the office for a while and see my girl.She suggested Hooter's (yeah, that's right...it wasn't me! :) We hadn't been to one for years, so we gave it a try. She had a Cobb Salad with Chicken Breasts and I had a Chicken Breast Sandwich with a side of fried pickles (I have a Norwegian heritage...we never saw a vegetable or fruit that we didn't want to fry, boil, bake or distill:)It's funny that we both ordered something with Breasts...must have been "in the air".It wasn't horrible, but it wasn't really good...mediocre, pedestrian, ordinary are words that come to mind. Even the pickles, which I had been wanting for a while.However, inexpensive is not a word that comes to mind...$36 for salad, sandwich, pickles and iced tea!I think we must be paying for ambiance. I Love Hooter's!!!!!No, not the restaurant:)

Tee Pee has been a family favorite of ours for 20+ years. It tends to be our meet-up spot on the weekends to sit at the bar, watch sports, and enjoy some authentic Mexican food! My dad and I love meeting up here for some quality father/daughter time! It has a dive-bar, cozy feel (which I love)! The service is always great and the food is always satisfying. I AM a creature of habit and always order the Albondigas soup (Mexican meatball soup) + rice inside and a small cheese crisp with green chilis and guacamole! Their house-made chips, hot sauce, and salsa are the bomb.com. I have been known to eat a whole bowl of chips and salsa to myself. Shh, don't tell. ;) If you're looking for a neighborhood favorite, authentic Mexican food joint, this is your place.

CPK. Creative. Pizzas. Kinda.When I think of the early 90s. I think of CPK. Of course I also think of Joey Lawrence on Blossom. But who doesn't, really? And new Coke. And we all know how that worked out. But CPK was innovative at the time. California cooking was all the rage thanks to Mr. Puck. The BBQ Chicken Pizza won over droves of pizza fans. Quickly, the Thai pizza caught on and CPK became quickly initialized in American culture like KFC, PTA and FYI. This location serves up the fare like all the others. Not much panache but dependable. Much like the Chevrolet Malibu. Could they use a bit of a makeover? Sure. But the Price Is Right set got one and no one's loving that. So why bother.

Review Text :
When Hoa called and said we were having a reunion of former branch employees at a Chinese buffet, I wasn't at all apprehensive. My normal concerns with such eateries--will the food be maintained at a proper food-safe temperature, is this seafood fresh, how long has the sushi been sitting out, will I be able to make it home before my intestines rupture--dissipated because Hoa knows good Asian cuisine. She is, of course, born to Vietnam and world traveled. Let's start with my happiest aspect about HKGB: the sushi. No, it's not the best sushi in the Valley, but they make it fresh for you on site. You can stand there and watch it being make, grab a soup or something else to munch on, or just sit at your table and chat awhile. Afterwards, you can head back for more sushi or veer over to the more traditional offerings of a Chinese buffet: sweet and sour chicken, fried rice, crab legs. Now let's review the not-so-shiny aspect: the price. Yes, it seems a little steep that we paid about $25 per person with tip (and I made only two rounds) but when you factor in the 2 hours we spent there, grazing, catching up, grazing, passing Lisette's daughter around, grazing and making plans to keep in touch, it's really not such an outrageous amount to pay. If you find yourself in this part of town, craving Chinese and are wicked crazy hungry, give HKGB a shot.Noticed that some yelpers don't really write reviews thats more than 1 paragraph or so... hopefully no one thinks I'm crazy for writing essay-like reviews on each one of the location that I've been to.  One paragraph is simply not enough room for me to describe a restaurant.With that said.. I totally forgot that on my Southwest tour I also visited a buffet while I'm in Phoenix...(Peter C. really enjoys my buffet reviews so I'm gonna make sure that I review each and every buffet I go to! Just for you Peter!!!)So it's about 8:15pm and we just arrived into Phoenix from Sedona after a 12 hr road trip...  I wanted something to eat but knowing that simple burger was not gonna do it.  So to treat my buddy I've decided to find a high reviewed buffets to indulge on!  (Thanks yelpers!)The place closes at 9:00pm so we had to work quick...  It's a typical chinese style buffet that you can find in LA dime a dozen ($14.99 for dinner which is little higher than the buffets here in LA)... The location was very clean, the dining time we went was completely empty....(maybe that made it look cleaner?)  There were 4 stations with about 6-8 hot trays with your typical food fares such as orange chicken, beef with brocolli, lemon salmon, fried wonton, crab rangoon, bbq ribs, prime rib, mayonaise covered mussels, simply steamed clams, string beans, fried noodles, fried rice, fruit salad, salad bar, and a very small selection of sushi bar that had like 3 types of sushi there...(Mongolian BBQ dude was on break or something....Not Available!)Overall the taste was half decent or was it because we were so hungry and that we had to finish up our meal fast because we still got another hour to go on the road?  Whatever it was the salmon was delicious and the ribs actually tasted really good.  Friend got the noodles with orange chicken, beef brocolli and thought idelicious as well....  I know for a fact that these chinese style buffets can't get any better or worse  (Unless you are Bamboo Garden then there is a great chance you can screw this up!), so as long as the food is not overly salty and has a respectable service, the experience should all be about the same...( I often wonder if all these chinese buffet chefs came out of a same buffet culinary school?  There's gotta be a hidden buffet university catering just to aspiring chinese buffet chefs!!!!  Seriously, how does buffet in CA taste the same as those in AZ?  or in face WA, OR, etc.?  )I'm guessing we were just really really hungry that is why it was so good.....Insanely 4 stars reviewed based on this one time visit....  hopefully I'm not too off.....  Good service though!  (It took us 20 minutes to be in & out of that place!  Call us The Flash of Meals!!!!!)

Restaurant name  Rito's Market & Mexican Take Out
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
I've frequented Rito's since the late 80's, way before it was cool to drive down through the Garfield neighborhood. One of the only positive things about working in the financial services industry is that no one seems to care if you take a 2 hour lunch in order to make your way in to "the hood" for some really good food.Lunch crowds are a mix of locals and lawyers, lined up shoulder to shoulder in a line that usually makes it way out the door. Take a dose of patience and a big appetite (oh and cash.... no plastic here).My favorite: the red mix burro enchilada style.... just typing that phrase makes my jaw shudder hannibal lecter style.This is another one of my absolute favorites in AZ. I've heard some folks pan on other boards but I just flat out don't get it. For people visiting AZ, this is a must go imo. My relatives visiting from Australia requested it as their last meal on their way out of town.First of all, I'm not a big green chili fan. Second of all, Rito's green chile burro is one of my top 3 bites in all of AZ.Tortillas are amazing (homemade), beans are amazing (I guess I'm still a big fan of lard). Unbelievably, beans seem to get even better when you microwave them from the fridge the next day too.I love the character of the place. It's run by a mother, her daughters & some other relatives. They do what they do & are who they are & don't really care beyond that. I've heard it compared to the Soup Nazi from the Seinfeld episode. My first visit, I did get that vibe but the ladies have been super sweet many, many times. It is a bit tough to find, they have short hours, they only take cash and as the sign says, do NOT approach the window on your cell phone.  I think at present they quit making tacos because they were too much work & the mom has had some health issues. So basically you get what you get. I say get the green chile burro.So they are who they are & do what they do, take it or leave it. I love it.As far as the shop, it's basically just a barred window counter you order from, you pick up your food & go outside & eat on picnic-like tables. They are open only M-F from 9 - 5ish. Close even a bit earlier on Fridays I think. They're on 14th street just south of Roosevelt right across from the school. You'll just see a screen door & that's it. If it's around lunch time, you'll probably see a line as well.I think the short hours & no evenings, no weekends even add to the obsession for me. Scarcity makes it even more desired.Right now, I cannot believe how much I'm craving this food.BTW, the warning about scalding food & soupy burrito are right on. Ended up with a bunch of scalding green chili in my lap my first visit.I've gotta go with A-OK on this one. Not quite ready to commit to being "a fan," yet. To me, being "a fan" would mean I would be willing to drive from North Central Phoenix all the way downtown, devil-may-care style on a work day, to wait in line and put up with the slamming of the metal door every time a customer's lunch order was fulfilled. (That's not a complaint, mind you. It was cool. All part of the charm.)You see, dinner is not an option. They're only open until 4. That said, I obeyed Robert M.'s instructions and ordered a green chile burrito, enchilada style with a side of beans. The beans were runny but good for dipping my bites of burrito. The sauce that made it  "enchilada style" had a good heat. I was pleased. It was "A-OK." I'd go back. Just probably not devil-may-care on a work day.I'm not gonna lie, this was pretty amazing Mexican food. Thank you Yelp. We would have never ever ever have found this place otherwise. They are located in a neighborhood and as of the time we paid a visit, they did not have a sign. It is a brick building that probably used to be a house, and we had to drive past it a couple times to realize we were there. They have a very simple menu, but I am not surprised they have found success with their amazing quality. We shared a enchilada style green chili burrito with beans on the side. WOW. It had cubed pork in it, but I was in love before I even hit any meat. The flavors are so delicious and all of the sauces together were perfect. The beans were super yummy and tasted very fresh and flavorful. We ordered a shredded beef taco that was a special for the day just in case the burrito wasn't going to be enough for the both of us, but it ended up just stuffing us until we couldn't breath. That taco was really good too! It seemed like they freshly fried the taco shell and they were very generous with the beef! Next time we will definitely be satisfied with just the enchilada style burrito to share since it was mighty large. Can't wait to come back for more!!

Set out to find some dinner with the fam at 8pm Monday night this place is basically across the street from me now. I thought, well this place has been here for years I've never tried it but there must be something good about it.......right!?!? I thought to myself eh WTH! After arguing with my munchkin to get out of the car for 10 mins because she wanted McDonalds instead (it was in her little 6 yr old view from the car) I finally lured her out with her DsLite! YAY So we walk in and were going to be seated in the dining room but we figured its 8pm the last quarter of the Indi & Miami game was on and the place was pretty empty after a quick glance around. We decided to sit in front of the big screen in the bar area! We made the right choice they have Italian soccer jersey's decorating the bar area and I felt very Italian by the end of the night. The server was excellent I repeat EXCELLENT with a capital E. Sorry I am no good with names and forgot his name but he was a tall Italian with some killer eyes complete with full accent!Peroni on tap you say!?!?! Score!! We started with some fried mozzarella it was DELICIOUS the marinara was fresh really chunky and tomato-y! The munchkin loved it and they even gave her Sprite in a cocktail glass. Who care's you say??? Well she will remember this for ages she even talked about it at home hours later. "Mom that was the fanciest glass I've ever had!" This place made her forget about McD's which I give 2 stars for entirely!! The bread was nice, it was toasted which the munchkin loved, she said she loves it toasted where its nice and crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside mmmm! Her words not mine. Ultimately the kid felt really comfy at this place where she is usually really shy and non speaking. The only thing with the bread was instead of olive oil they brought out packaged whipped butter which wasn't bad and I probably could have asked for some oil but I'm not really complaining here so fugetaboutit kwim!The specials that were not on the menu sounded fantastic so we went with them!! After the past weekend and watching Anthony Bourdain in Southeast Asia eating clams I had to have the fresh linguine and clams w/ white sauce. It was DELICOUS!! They will pretty much make any order the way you want it white or red sauce etc. I for one appreciate that aspect. The man had the pork chop stuffed with prosciutto and mozzarella with a tasty marsala wine sauce and mushrooms mmmm he only gave up one bite for me but it was choice!We passed up on dessert but not without the waiter bringing us some shots of their in house homemade limoncello!! OMG just ask how they make it and for some sugar on the rim if you like that sort of thing it was awesome!! That totally topped my night!! I cant wait to go back and try the eggplant parm next! My mouth is watering just thinking about it. Ciao Bello/Bella's!!Holy shit.Where do I begin? First off, "Joey's California Bistro Italian Restaurant"? Isn't that like, "Mandy's Apparel Shop Store for Clothes"?The place was mostly empty, save for terrible, dated decor and a smattering of rather lively and vivacious flies. A waiter was screaming at a customer from the other side of the restaurant. Even when I realized they were screaming sports-oriented things, it still wasn't normal. As our waiter wheezed the specials of the day to us, we feared he was literally about to die in the middle of the word "stuffed".Our salads consisted of romaine, three pieces of cucumber, and one tomato, cut in half. The bleu cheese dressing contained no actual cheese. I ordered tea with lemon and honey, but the honey was a "blend" made out of mostly high fructose rice syrup... is honey too rare a commodity to hunt down these days? Our dinner companion ordered lobster ravioli with shrimp. The waiter brought the lobster ravioli out, then the shrimp, separately, in a little cup. Oh, and the shrimp was BOILED. What is this, 1965? What the actual f*#&.It'd be one thing if this place was dirt cheap, but entrees hit well over $20.Do yourself a favor. Rather than coming here, just eat the money. Even if it's in coins.

Review Text :
I don't understand how this rates so high. As other reviewers have said, this is not good sushi. It's edible (thus the 2 star rating), but it's not great. I have been to this restaurant 3 times to make sure I wasn't missing anything, and each time I've been only mildly satisfied. They do not serve real crab, their rolls fall apart, and the service is not that great. Maybe I'm going at the wrong time? I have been there during lunch time each time I've gone and have not been impressed at all. On the 3rd try, my friend and I decided that we would not be returning any more.I could've sworn I've written and updated reviews of this place.  Where did they go?  Sakana is my favorite sushi restaurant.  If it weren't for the fact that I've developed allergies to rice and most white fish and certain shellfish (I pretty much stick to wild fish now, and you know how rare it is to find, and how expensive it can get!), I'd eat sushi and sashimi everyday!  (Well, OK, every OTHER day, for I also can eat THAI FOOD everyday!)Lunch combos are great!  In taste and in price.  We would always order the baked mussels.  Loved the spider and crunch eel rolls.  I honestly can't remember disliking anything we've tried here.  It's been awhile since I last visited, so I may update my review soon!Found a new lunch spot oh yea! Went with some coworkers on a Friday at high noon, guess what yall the place was packed, but we waited about 5 mins and then got seated. Right when you walk in you can see on the counter what the lunch specials are, and I knew before I was seated what I wanted! I ordered the Sakana lunch special which was delish! It had rolls, jalapeno stuff crab popper things, tuna, salmon and other fish, came with soup & salad and was 10 bucks!! TEN BUCKS YALL!!! OMG it was delish! I know normally I would not be able to get all that for ten bucks!  Sushi was fresh and great tasting, service was kinda slow, but it was a very busy Friday lunch rush! I am glad to have found them and to add them to my many lunch spots stops! I will be back!I am almost wanting to go and un-star places I have been before, because they pale in comparison to this place.We got 4 orders of nigiri: Salmon, more salmon, tuna, and Salmon roe -- all of them were amazing. We also got a spicy tuna roll which was fresh and delicious, and eel roll which was tangy and delightful.The sushi was SO FRESH, I couldn't believe it. The nigiri was powerful in it's simplicity, and the rolls were incredibly well constructed and  beautifully presented. On top of that, the wait staff here really has their shit together -- like WHOA. Nobody missed a beat, everyone was helpful, and the sushi chef's were chopping and going through order tickets like wildfire, smiling the entire time. Some guy even bought them 4 bottles of sake for their great effort, and I know it was well deserved.Amazing service. Even better sushi.$22 dollars. AAAAAH! I will eat here every day for the rest of my life!!!

Just like its namesake, this spot is loud, wild and crazy. If you come here before or after a sporting event, it's sure to be jam packed from floor to ceiling. I've seen every type of person here from the out of towner older gentlemen entertaining .... younger ladies.... to families taking down the super gigantic hot dog that Adam Richmond dominated on Man Vs Food to college student drinking the entire bar up before the game. It's a fun atmosphere, the food is generic bar food with the exception of some ginormous food options and overall just an exciting and enthusiastic crowd and seen. This is definitely a spot to keep on the list if you're in Downtown looking for a fun spot to stop into before or after a game.ROCK OUT WITH YOUR COCK OUT!!!As a big heavy metal and hard rock fan I just had to make sure to hit up Alice Cooperstown on my recent visit to Phoenix. As I walked into this warehouse sized rock & sports mecca I was surely not disappointed.This place is huge. There is an outdoor beer garden seating area on the side of the building and when you walk indoors you realize that this place is airplane hanger big. Rock and roll memorabilia is plastered everywhere here with a terriic amount of Alice Cooper posters, gold and platinum records, photos, paintings, guitars, and other stuff representing his Hall of Fame career plastered throughout. Even all the tables are covered in rock photos and images. Along side all of that is a mix of sports memorabilia spread throughout with flat screen tv's and large projection screens everywhere! Yeah, as you can imagine, they play some great rock music here, classic to current. This is the type of place that Hard Rock Cafe wishes it could be.The menu here is pretty big with a mix of classic bar food, comfort food, and BBQ. Nice selection of beers on tap and in bottles. We ordered a mixed BBQ platter and it was actually some pretty decent BBQ! Great ribs and tasty brisket. Alas, what caught my eye was The Big Unit. Not just a regular hot dog, but 22 inches of Vienna Beef destruction loaded with chili, onions, jalapenos, sauerkraut, relish, tomatoes, cheese sauce, shredded cheddar, and bacon, along with a bunch of crispy fries. Oh Yeah! This is the dog that Adam Richman devoured on Man vs Food! They ring a big bell whenever this is ordered. I saw a few people give up on it and take half home in a box. Not me. Now I was going to join that fat ass and do some damage here myself!Yup, I ate that whole damn thing! Honesty, it was pretty tasty and was not too hard to finish. Just had to pace myself. Drinking a huge cup of diet Coke while doing this was not too smart as my gut felt like it was going to explode! Still, I got the whole thing down my throat bit by bit and swallowed it whole. Heh-heh-heh! I sat there in euphoric bliss of my accomplishment. Boy, did I feel like a fat slob.On the way out we had to look around the souvenier area and picked up a few things. Had a great time here and the food was pretty good. Nice waitress and all of them here wear Alice Cooper-like eye makeup while working which adds to the fun. Menu items are fairly priced too. This part of town is empty unless a game is going on and there is a parking garage across the street, along with metered spots on the streets but after 8PM they are free. Lots of available parking.MAN vs FOOD AIN'T GOT NOTHING ON ME!!!Cold beer good food good music and a cool staff ill defiantly come back!I have been lucky to get really good service at most locations I dine at...That's why people call me Lucky (they don't). So when I get bad service, a generally OK experience becomes anything but OK. Lets buy a ticket and check out Alice Cooper'stown.~Fud/Drink~General....bar....fare. That makes it really simple for everyone. Now they have some interesting food options, yes, but there is nothing special. Why elaborate further? Alice's joint only offers greasy fried food options, with little time put into the preparing of said items.  For a football event I went to, they were offering breakfast. I ordered a cheese/egg quesadilla which was "edible". Filled with grease, I had second thoughts after ordering it, but was hungry. Meh. Of the two stand out items on their menu, the 22 inch hotdog named "The Big Unit" is a big hit. Its big, yes....but that's where it ends. You pay $17+ for a big hotdog guys...its really nothing much to write home about. Why pay that?? If going to the Dbacks game, why not get one or two $1 dogs at Chase? Just saying... I must say the other item on the menu that stood out was the catcher's mitt brownie. For $4.99 you get a HUGE warm brownie plus a scoop of ice cream, everyone at the table was impressed. As for drinks, they really are just overpriced. I know they have rent, I get it. But seriously, $6.50 for a draft that isn't close to a pint? Horrible pricing decision. I would've had an extra beer but this turned me off immediately. Nothing else to say, just too expensive for what you are getting!~Atmosphere/Service~Atmosphere is OK, it could be so much better. The inside is fun on the surface, and they have some cool memorabilia hanging up..it is nice to see what Alice put out for us to view. But overall the bar is there for large groups to gather and talk, no extra fluff. When each Big Unit comes out, an obnoxiously loud ringing bell sounds and the bar staff yells out a chant. After a good 30+ rings, I was saved by the bell when my football game ended. As for service, we were the first table to be sat, and had anywhere between 3-8 people at given times. Service was consistently slow, despite the fact the bar was at about 1/2 capacity for most of the day. I had to flag down our waitress a couple times to get service, and remember that brownie I talked about earlier? Well, it sat on our table for 2 hours after being finished. It was still on the table when I had began leaving. So, service was bad. Really hitting the nail on the head, there was no reason why we shouldn't have been waited on more, especially since we had the largest group in the joint that day. Poor service..meh.~Extras/Rating~Overall, its not the best option for grabbing a drink and bite before games downtown. I have made suggestions for other locations, and those suggestions stand. They get 2 stars for location and a nice array of TV's for game day. They lose 3 stars for poor service, poor price for quality, and underwhelming ambiance. They can do SO MUCH BETTER...And until they change things, you can do so much better as well.Alice Cooper'stown is directly across the street from the US Airways Center (home to the Phoenix Suns.)  When I first visited the restaurant, the Suns were putting their finishing moves on the Utah Jazz (84-87), and I suppose it was due to the game that business that evening was slow.  However, for me, it didn't matter.  Besides paying respect to Mr. Cooper, an episode of "Man vs Food" wherein Adam Richman and Alice--the shock-rocking legend himself--attack 22"-long "Big Unit" hotdogs was motivation enough: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C86akA3G6rg.The "Big Unit"--smothered in "Nightmare" Chili, bacon, cheese sauce, sauerkraut, jalapeños, diced tomatoes and onions, sweet relish, and shredded cheddar--is jaw-dropping!  In fact, upon delievery, fire alarms--shrilling throughout the restaurant--direct full attention to this behemoth as it snakes its way toward its next victim: me.  Respectfully named after the now-retired, 6'10" Arizona Diamondback, Randy "The Big Unit" Johnson, this dog headlines.  At $19.99, it seems a bit steep, but I couldn't eat more than a third.  Along with the fries, it easily feeds two or three.  Divided, the cost is more than reasonable.The "Elaine Benes" Big Salad, the "Johnny 'Beef' Depp", the "Al McCoy" ["The Voice of the Suns" since 1972] Crispy Chicken Salad, the "John O'Hurley" ["Seinfeld's" J. Peterman] Buffalo Chicken Wrap: the menu items definitely hail celebrity.  But why not?  The fare--along this guitar-lined, autograph-infused, rock-n-roll museum--is meant to be fun.  And it is.  Even though, on this evening, the locals were instead supporting their beloved Suns, I had a great time with my friends.  Cooper'stown is worth a try.I will say that it's an interesting touch that the servers and bartenders should adopt the Cooper-esque eye make-up--it's cool--but our server wasn't enthused: his bother-me-not attitude and poor service had me questioning his allegiance.  I mean, you work at Cooper'stown!  I know that between two servers and four tables, feeling as though you're in the weeds at times is natural, but couldn't you at least "feign" appreciation and interest?  The manager, however, checked-in on us, refilled our drinks, and asked about our visit.  I think he's quite aware.Note to Mr. Cooper:  When I was a kid, Alice Cooper album covers completely unnerved--yet intrigued--me.  I was ten, and I remember visiting our neighbors--hard rockers to the core--who had many of your LP's resting against their metal-plated, knob-heavy component stereo system in their living room.  I would walk around their house pretending I was cool and ignoring--or at least attempting to ignore--your nightmare: I couldn't look you in the eye.  At Cooper'stown, however, upon the slightest chance that you might drop in, I'd kept an eye out...just in case!  I'm not afraid anymore...I don't think.   =]   Nevertheless, for your music, your vision, and your endeavors, I'm a fan.  And I thank you.22" wiener, $27, meh. http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=4ZfcCa4m5RWvO4EFzfYm1AI know it's unfair but I have to compare all hot dogs to what you can get at Costco for $1.50. And in this case, I would have happily forwent the baguette, chili, bacon, cheese, kraut, etc. etc., for a dozen Costco dogs and Polish dogs. Here, the massively long and narrow wiener was overcooked to the point where the skin was starting to crinkle and pull away from the meat (that's what she said? Ew). Add too many par toppings and you have an overpriced novelty dog at an equally novel bar-type thing. Fun if you're an Alice Cooper fan or need a bar to get sloshed and watch games at. But this review is just for the dog.Now this is what I call a good time! Double References Everywhere! Alice Cooper meets Cooperstown: music and baseball collide to bring this interesting food experience. I appreciated the attention to detail, from the servers' eye makeup to the live music outside, even in the 100 degree Phoenix heat. Now that, ladies and gentlemen, is dedication. You can try the Big Unit, of Man vs. Food fame....enough Unit to feed 3 people comfortably. Trust us, we did it. Every time one comes out of the kitchen, lights flash, and the servers all yell, "BIG UNIT!" Love the play on words, plus the reference to the Randy Johnson, as Alice Cooper'stown is two blocks down from Chase Field. We ordered a regular 22' dawg, not the one with all the fixin's. Delish! I was also a fan of the Bloody Marys, mac n' cheese bites, and the beer selection. A very cool stop before a baseball game at Chase Field! Bonus: Go shopping! Tanks, tees, and auction items are available.

Review Text :
I'll be honest, this wasn't our first, second or even third option for breakfast, but when it came to early Sunday grubbing with a group of six, this was pretty much the only place didn't have a two-day long wait. In fact, there was no wait at all when the six of us popped in a little after noon on the weekend. Odd, but my group was hungry so we didn't question the kismet. The restaurant is pretty enormous as far as cafes go, and it's nice because they don't pack the tables on top of each other so you're never going to be crammed next to a crying baby or having to scoot your chair in every time the table next to you needs a coffee refill. The furnishings all appear to be second hand finds as well as local art and LOTS of owl statues. It's a hoot, for sure. One weird thing is the one bathroom with the sink outside, so if you're sitting in the back you can heavily monitor who comes out and doesn't wash their poopy hands. On the other hand, if you go to the bathroom here you'll likely feel like you have to make your hand washing some sort of big production so the other people in the back will take notice of your exceptional hygiene habits.I was feeling pretty sick still and actually brain washed myself  into believing that my weekend bug was actually morning sickness so on top of already feeling super nauseous and not hungry, and naturally my non-motherly instincts wanted to starve whatever demon might be brewing inside me but the hypothetical baby's daddy insisted I eat something and took it upon himself to order me the tofu scramble, which I was sort of excited to try despite feeling otherwise very green. It was actually very bland and dry and even though I think it was only like $3, I think I would have rather had the $3 in my pocket than the scramble so I took a few bites and then pawned it off on the boo who insisted I try his veggie breakfast burrito. The burrito was the total opposite of the scramble- absolutely outstanding and even though it was the size of a guinea pig, I think I could have downed the whole thing (of course, I would have blamed it on my imaginary incubating child and said I was eating for two). Going around the table, everyone seemed content with their food, besides the grits order that were decidedly bland, but that's kind of how I've come to think of grits in general. Our service was great and though most of the table's food was just okay, that burrito, the owl statues and the house horchata I ordered as my beverage really made the experience for me. I guess what I'm trying to say is that I can understand the 3-star average on Yelp, but that I think you can totally come here and have a 4 or even 5 star time if you order wisely. Just remember: Burrito, horchata and time the bathroom-goers for extra entertainment. PS- I'm so NOT pregnant (in fact, can someone get me a heat pack a few dozen Midol?), but thanks for your concern.I don't think I would have known about Quiet Storm if it hadn't popped up several times in friends' Yelp feeds in the last couple years.  I'm all about veg/vegan restaurants, but I have to agree with other reviewers who wish Quiet Storm's food was *slightly* more interesting.  Husband and I ordered take-out so we could enjoy a late lunch al fresco at Schenley Park overlook.  Folks working were vegan-hipster quirky, but friendly and helpful.  We ended up waiting about 30 minutes for our food, so we decided to partake in an afternoon coffee to pass the time.  I  had an iced Morroccan latté with cardamom and rose,  husband the Mandorla sweet almond milk latté.  Both were excellent.For my meal I picked the Tahini Bowl with brown rice, spinach, roasted red pepper, tomatoes, pepitas and fried tofu cutlet with a tahini dressing.  I wished there had been less rice and more dressing; the bowl was also screaming for more seasoning.  Husband opted for the Crunch Wrap Extreme: scrambled tofu tossed with celery, carrots, edamame, kale and spinach, dressed with vegan wasabi mayo.  Again, twice as much dressing would have added flavor and moisture to an otherwise fine wrap.And that's just it: the food at Quiet Storm is fine.  When really, I'd been hoping to be utterly wowed by the magic capable of being worked by nothing more than mere vegetables, plain grains and humble legumes.  Still, I won't discourage you from eating here.  I just might come back myself.It had been a very very long time since I'd visited Quiet Storm. For some weird reason, I had in my head that they made these awesome smoothies. Well... they do not. But they make milkshakes. Any other day I would have totes been into the shake but...I reeeeeally wanted a smoothie, so I opted out of the milkshake (I know, a rare occasion), and went with a iced chai. I love that they make their own mix of chai and they also don't sweeten it, so you can sweeten it yourself. Super sweet chai is super gross. Just sayin'. I also ordered the Sesame Noodle Platter (noodles, soy, tofu, red cabbage, mushrooms, broccoli, onions, peppers) with a ginger carrot salad. It was a solid meal. I mean, it wasn't necessarily a platter (I think a variety of separate items), but a noodle dish. I liked that there was a decent amount of veggies and not just a few, with a massive amount of noodles. I hate when that happens! It was also lightly sauced, not too heavy and sticky. Plus the fried tofu was awesome! Honestly, I've never had such good tofu before. I rarely get it because I think tofu can be so bland, but this was bomb! A nice plus is it's a great environment to eat and work. Free WiFi and nice big tables to work on. Plus, throw in friendly service and it's a win!

Why does it smell funky here? Why does my bf like it here? Why am I yelping Chili's?A)Clean your mop before mopping up the entry. Maybe it won't smell like my Aunt Hazel's pantry then. B)Well, he's young, and chain restaurants seem like a safe bet to him. They're a safe bet to me. However, not in a pleasing way. C)Cuz I actually like the fajitasIf you like deep fried shoe leather smothered in canned gravy. Hey, go for the chicken fried steak. If you like a combo plate with all the flavor and spice of Scandanavian food. By all means, order the combo plate.  And if you like dining amidst screaming babies and folks with the culinary palette of a middle school student. Hey, Chili's is your place. Bon Apetit and o freakin' lay!

Restaurant name  Donatelli's Italian Food Center

Review Text :
I've now been to Donatelli's multiple times, and have sampled several of their products, so I feel that I can review it comprehensively. Overall, I've been pleased with most of their products, the prices, and the customer service and atmosphere, hence the 4-star rating.As others have mentioned, the space is rather cramped and chaotic, esp. during peak business hours (e.g., Sat. around noon, when I last stopped in).  The layout when you walk in is a bit strange, to the point that I inadvertently ended up behind the counter on my first visit.  (Stay to the left and you won't have this problem.)  The most crowded section of the store is the deli counter, where you can obtain not only meats and cheeses, but a variety of made-to-order sandwiches and sides.  If you visit the deli counter during peak hours and are feeling indecisive, take a number right away--trust me, you'll have plenty of time to decide what to get as others are being helped.As for the grocery products, there is enough variety that you can find several versions of most Italian ingredients you'll need here, as well as other general grocery items like milk and ice cream. In general, prices are very reasonable-- generally less expensive than Groceria Italiana.  Unlike Groceria Italiana, a good portion of the product consists of commercially-available brands--albeit many that you wouldn't encounter in a mainstream grocery store like Giant Eagle. Having said that, the main attraction for me is the made-in-house items, such as the fresh pasta, the sauces, and the biscotti, as well as the hot meals.In the interest of brevity, here is a list of products I've bought at Donatelli's, followed by price, recommendation, and comments:Grandma's plain sauce ($3.65): Recommended--Better flavor and seasoning than commercial jarred sauces (e.g., Ragu, etc.)  Also, I like that Donatelli's makes meatless red sauce, unlike Groceria Italiana, since I don't eat beef.Lobster ravioli ($9.99): Not recommended--After following boiling directions (necessary to avoid curdling cream sauce via baking), pasta was good, but filling was mushy.  Also, included imitation crabmeat, and I'm not a fan of imitation foods.  I'll be sticking to Groceria Italiana's handmade ravioli from now on.Ricotta pie ($5.49): Recommended--Though this was my first time trying it, I was favorably impressed with the flavor and texture.Biscotti ($3.52): Recommended--I've only had the spumoni biscotti (a flavor I haven't seen elsewhere), but it tasted fresh and was good.Italian bread ($1.50): Recommended--Soft and fresh, and inexpensiveHot food from deli counter: Recommended--I had the half pound fish sandwich ($2.49) and a half pound of the white cheddar bake ($2.99), and both were very good.  Notably, the roll was proportional to the fish, so the sandwich didn't fall apart, as is common at other PGH eateries serving fish sandwiches.Despite how hectic Donatelli's can be during peak hours, I've been impressed at the friendly service that I've received at the deli counter and checkout.  If there's one drawback, it's that waits at both counters are inevitable during these times.  Of course, if your schedule permits, this problem can be avoided by simply visiting at non-peak times.While Donatelli's may feel kind of cramped and may not seem as immaculately clean as some big box grocery stores (at least for the section the customer sees), this is part of its charm as a neighborhood ethnic grocery store.  I'll definitely continue stopping in for certain Italian grocery items, such as the plain sauce, biscotti, and bread, as well as for inexpensive, delicious hot lunch items.I love this place. Love that I can walk to it, that it has an amazing deli, some amazing frozen marinara sauces, and that the customer service is just great.I tend to come here for their fresh breads on Saturday, their grandma's marinara, and just the random things that I may forget at the regular grocery store. Oh not to mention they have 3 types of prosciutto!! Three!!  Anyway, they also have a ton of nuts, and sweets, as well and a boat load of olive oil. One thing that they are limited in is their produce, don't expect to get anything too crazy here.  Either way, this place is just clutch in order to have a good Italian dinner prepared at home. That or just to pick up some milk, eggs, and some deli meat!!I totally recommend this joint!!

09/09/102.5 stars!I'd acquired a gift card, so we decided to have an early dinner here before catching a show at AMC.  I asked if complimentary bread was available.  The server said it was, and would we like some olives w/ it?  "Sure!," we chimed.  Rosemary focaccia w/ olives tasted wonderful, although the olives were, naturally, very salty.  Were we told that the olives would cost extra, we probably would've passed on the suggestion (since my Mom isn't gaga over olives due to their saltiness).  I'd recently added eggplant to my diet, so I was on an eggplant kick.  We therefore had to try the eggplant parmigiana, which came w/ capellini pasta and a side salad.  I also wanted to try their spinach salad w/ blue cheese.  I don't know, but whenever I read "candied walnuts" in an entree's description, I just have to order it!The side salad was a lot bigger than any side salad I've ever encountered before; it was big enough to satisfy us until the main entree arrived, but there was the extra insalata blu to contend w/.  It was good, but we both favored the side Caesar salad.  The dressing was just perfect for the amount of greens present.  The eggplant parmigiana was a big disappointment!  My first two bites were a mix of eggplant, pasta, and cheese, and I found the combo to be very bland.  I then tried the eggplant and the cheese on its own, and I was dumbstruck to find that the eggplant tasted like the cheese, and vice-versa!  Even the pasta tasted the same as the veggie and the cheese.  I tried the part where the server added parmesan cheese, and there was no added flavor there, either!  Since I did not find satisfaction w/ the entree, I started craving for something sweet-- the vanilla gelato w/ strawberries was the answer :)  Mom didn't care for this dish, but no worries!  More for me!!The best thing out of our experience at Macaroni Grill that afternoon was that when the main entree was delivered, our server had automatically split the entree onto two plates WITHOUT OUR HAVING TO ASK!  This simple act impressed us both and garnered this review an extra star :)I'd like to give MG another chance, but w/ so many great non-chain Italian restaurants in the valley, I'll find it hard to justify going back so soon.

Review Text :
Awesome food. Definitely a good place to eat if it is your first time in Madison, WI.The moment you walk in you are transported into another time and place. They had live music that fit the scene, made the atmosphere, and stayed background enough to have a conversation - check it out Tuesdays through Saturdays.Order the pecan catfish with the crawfish BBQ on top, aka "Maria's special". It sounds wacky but the pecans really go with the blackened catfish. The tasso and shrimp fettuccine - a combination of shrimp, smoked ham, and mustard cream sauce sounds like a questionable combination but it is soothing, hot soul food at its fanciest. Everything we ate had depth, richness, and finesse. If you are a soup snob, definitely get the soup over the salad option. Presentation was lacking but I don't think that's the point of soul food.  Service is sassy but whole-hearted. We walked in without reservations at 7pm on a Friday and when we asked if we could sit at the bar we were told "yeah, if you can find seats".  We found a couple stools and ordered dinner at the bar. It isn't bend over backwards service, but they are real people and sometimes that's better. Maria, our bartender who's worked there 13 years, gave excellent food and drink recs and was really attentive despite the rush - she basically made our night. It's a great place to bring guests if you want to head off to a chill and unexpected place. Even better if you're prepared to stuff your faces with well-executed comfort food. Try the Sazerac if you want a stiff, sweet drink and the Hurricane if you want a fruity, refreshing beverage that punches like a Long Island. The crowd here is mature and casually well-dressed.My husband and I went to Louisianne's recently after we sold our condo and got a Middleton Chamber of Commerce gift certificate from our real estate agent (Leslie Blum, she's great!).We wanted to use the opportunity to have a special date night and go somewhere a bit more upscale than we usually do. Having never been to Louisianne's in the 5 years that I've lived in Middleton, I suggested we try it out.I give the atmosphere of this place a solid five stars. Although it has an rather bland looking storefront, the inside of the restaurant is anything but. You walk into Louisianne's and immediately head downstairs. It's all stone and looks like you're walking into a cool cave or something. It's dark, but there's a lot of ambiance. I've been to New Orleans, and it definitely has that sort of vibe to it. It's romantic, fun, and not what you'd expect from the outside. I felt like we were on vacation while we were there. Also, there was a live jazz band playing and they were really rocking. It was awesome!We went at about 8pm on a Friday night had to wait about ten minutes for a table, which was fine. While we waited, we ordered drinks at the bar and watched the band. I had red wine, and my husband had Jameson on the rocks. We were seated and ordered the Pecan Crab Cakes as an appetizer. They were good, probably just 3 stars though, as they tasted a lot like other Midwestern crab cakes that I've had before. They were heavy on bread and light on crab...with a lot of Old Bay seasoning. Again, they weren't bad at all, but not spectacular.Next, we ordered some more wine and our entrees (more on those in a minute).  We were given a choice of soup or salad with our entrees and we each ordered soup. They had two soups of the day: a shrimp -corn chowder (which I got), and a tomato-based pulled pork stew that was like chilli (which my husband had). Both soups were fantastic! Definitely 5 stars for the soup. I'll take a minute here to comment that I enjoy going to traditional restaurants from time to time, places where soup/salad and bread are included with your meal instead of everything being ala-cart. (It reminds me of dining in Wisconsin supper clubs as a child). By the way, the bread basket was delicious and was quickly replenished by the waitress after we ate all of the bread within 30 seconds of sitting down because it was warm and toasty (and served with soft butter) and we were starving! Onto the entrees! My husband absolutely LOVED his dish. He claims that it was possibly "the best thing I've ever had in a restaurant". He chose the Coffee Roasted Chicken, which featured a bed of (homemade) fettuccine topped with a coffee-crusted bone-in grilled chicken breast, in a "hazelnut, orange, ricotta sauce". I think there was spinach in it too. The pasta was perfectly al dente, the grilled chicken moist, and the sauce was rich and creamy. It almost reminded me of a Thai peanut sauce, but with hazelnuts instead. Although it sounded like something that could become cloyingly sweet, it was not. It had a nice subtle umami essence in addition to the sweetness. Delicious. 5 stars.The reason that Louisianne's is not getting a five star review from me, however, is due to my entree, which I felt was very underwhelming. We don't eat pasta at home for health reasons, so I usually get it when we go somewhere nice as a special treat. I chose the tasso and shrimp fettuccine because it was homemade pasta, and because it featured authentic New Orleans style ingredients (for the unfamiliar, tasso is basically spicy ham). The shrimp and tasso pieces in my pasta were well-cooked, but they were sparse. The dish also featured mushrooms, and they were fabulous...probably the best part. However, the pasta was supposed to have a "Creole mustard cream sauce", and it didn't really. The sauce was very light, and had little flavor. It was kind of sad, because I was really hoping to be wowed and I wasn't. I'd say my item was probably 3 stars, and would have been awesome if only the sauce had been a bit more pronounced and flavorful. The service was adequate. Nothing remarkable in either a good or a bad way.Summary: I'd definitely return. I think Lousianne's Etc. is a decently nice restaurant overall, and is great for special occasions. Their primary issue, from both my own experience as well as the reviews on Yelp, seems to be consistency. Some menu items are fabulous, and others are meh. The major problem with this is that Louisianne's  menu is at a price point where people only go occasionally...so the restaurant basically has one shot to impress, and if they fail at that, guests won't return for a second chance. I think this explains why the Yelp reviews for Louisianne's are so polarized.This little place has been on our list for awhile and we finally made it last Friday night!  It was a cold windy night, so descending into a warm cozy basement space seemed to fit!  We were greeted by a cheery hostess who promptly seated us at a corner table.  Johnny Chimes was at the piano, which set a perfect tone for the evening.  Our waitress greeted us and we ordered up some fabulous food!The shrimp and corn chowder was perfectly creamy, spicy, and loaded with shrimp.  Our entrees were the Etouffee with crawfish and the roasted shrimp.  The etouffee was deliciously spiced with a generous portion of crawfish that tasted like mini lobsters!  The roasted shrimp were outstandingly fresh and served over a bed of lightly wilted spinach with balsamic glazed onions and topped with parm...so fresh and delectable.Friendly service, cozy space, outstanding cajun cuisine...we will definitely be going back!

We walked in expecting everything to be new and fresh...like the commercials say??? Well ehhh wrong, there was new menus however. My friend said "Maybe they come and switch out the lamps after you sit down just like on the commercial?" We had fun with this so he asked the waiter. The waiter informed us that they are one of the few that will be staying with the original theme Tiffany lamps and all. After he left I thought to myself....What if they didnt change any of them?!? What if they give you that BS story at every RT you go to?!? What if they get away with it??? Somone should confirm this for me!!Fresh Avocado QuesadillaPerfectly ripe avocados, grated Swiss cheese, and freshly made pico de gallo in a grilled flour tortilla. Very good for a veg-o-saurus like me mmmm I will go back. The new menu was the only reason I tried RT food again I usually just drink there for HR.

I have been robbed twice by the Saloon.  Someone there likes to write in tips so if you use a credit or debit card at the Saloon make ABSOLUTELY sure that you check you bank statement the next day. After the first time I wrote it up as a mistake on my part or their but the last time I was flabbergasted.  I went in on some Yeungling special night, ordered one beer, and wrote a dollar tip.  The next morning I checked my statement and I had been charged 25.00 for that single beer.  This is not only a bad business practice but it is illegal and fraud.  But they will keep saying it was an 'accident' as long as they can get away with it.  If you do have to go here I IMPLORE you to only use cash and look at your change carefully. This bar should be your absolute last resort in Mt Lebanon.At closing time as well, get ready for the Mt Lebo Police Dpt to pull up outside and start hassling people who are WALKING HOME.  There are other great bars in Mt Lebanon that are far more deserving of your money.

We had one night to go out to dinner during our recent Charlotte visit, and Al Mike's is where my friend wanted to take us.  Of course, I had to look up the reviews on Yelp before I agreed, and once I did, I was sold.  And now that I've been, I must say, Charlotte Yelpers, you are right on with this one!I love this incredibly charming historic restaurant and the 4th Ward neighborhood that surrounds it.  AM's atmosphere is warm and inviting.  Luckily, we arrived early on Saturday night (around 6:30), so we didn't have to wait for a table... (The restaurant did, however, fill up within a half hour).The highlights in my eyes:*great beer selection!*fried pickles! *burger*onion ringsIt was my first time ever trying fried pickles, and I'm a fan!  We devoured them as an appetizer for the table.  We weren't huge fans of the crab soup, and I'd stay away from salads... they are nothing special.The service was attentive with a snap of attitude.  I think they probably are friendlier toward their regulars, but that's fine by me.  If I lived in the area, I'd be a regular too!Need a good, unique date spot? Here's the place. Great little hidden gem in uptown's historic 4th Ward neighborhood.Food: First things first... whatever meal you get make sure to get a cup or bowl of the spicy crab soup. Money. Not so hungry or just want a snack? The fried pickles are spot on. The London Broil is just fantastic. The marinade they use on it is super delicious. Dinner version comes sliced up in entree form... lunch as a sandwich. You get a side item with both.Bar: They have a good selection of local beers. If the restaurant is busy and you can't get a table... sit here. The service is always top notch.Parking: there is a lot less than a block from the restaurant between Graham and Pine. There seems to be a lot of confusion surrounding parking here. I think a lot of it is because the signs are kind of confusing. You can park there for two hours without a parking permit. Bonus: had too much to drink and need to take a cab? The A Mike's staff will you show you where you can park your car overnight.I love to bring out of town guests here. Such a charming place in a great neighborhood. Warm, welcoming, homey atmosphere.Al Mike's is my shit.  Want to a good place for a first date? Check.  Want Triple C babymaker in pints? Check?  Want awesome food at a great price?  Chickity friggin check. l Mike's is located in a really awesome part of the fourth ward.  Tree lined streeets and amazing houses.  Al Mike's itself looks like an awesome house turned into a restaurant.  When you walk in, you kind of feel like its an irish pub from the 80's, but this character is what makes it cozy and awesome.  The kitchen is the size of a shoe box and I don't understand how they turn out such great food as quick as they do.  It must be some type of wizardry. They have a semi cajun menu and cajun fries are always a good side dish.  Their crab soup is out of control.  Things to get here are the pasta dishes, the chicken dish, and for a sandwich the London Broil ( medium rare of course!).  This is my ace in the hole whenever I have no idea what I want. I love you Al Mike's!

My first time here for lunch. I went with 2 other friends. What we had:Appetizer: artichoke and spinach dip with tortilla chips Lunch: fish and chips, and their special of the day meatballs.We got our appetizer and it was good. The fish and chips were a little on the greasy side, but what do you expect for fried fish and french fries. The meatballs... that's another story. They used a spice in it that had a very strong licorice taste (I think the spice is called anise). There were 4 meatballs for $7.95. I took a small bite off of one and almost gagged. I could not handle the licorice taste. I asked if I can substitute it for fish and chips and make it "to go" as we were running out of time. When the check came, they did not take the meatballs off and asked the waitress about it. Come to find out that the OWNER said "JUST BECAUSE I DIDN'T LIKE IT, I STILL HAD TO PAY FOR IT!". I WAS SHOCKED!!!!  I told her, then I didn't want the fish and chips. I only ordered a higher price item as not to walk out with only a $30 bill.  We ended up leaving paying $46, $8.00 for the meatballs that I only had 1 bite out of! It's a good thing I ate my share of the artichoke dip or I would have STARVED!I WILL NEVER BE COMING BACK HERE AGAIN!!!!!I've heard from several people that Wally's is like a Phoenix landmark... it's been around for awhile and they supposedly have a great happy hour!  Crazy that in my 3 years in Phoenix, today was my first visit to Wally's, but it won't be my last!I met 2 friends for lunch.  When we made our plans, they both suggested Wally's because of their convenient location and their 'caramelized vidalia onion & Guinness soup.'  I'm not a fan of french onion soup, but I really wanted to try Wally's anyways, so that's what we did!  I was acknowledged upon walking in by Chip, the General Manager... he was extremely friendly and suggested we sit outside since It was a beautiful day.  He was right - sitting on the patio was perfect!Service was attentive and cold drinks were brought out right away... we started with the hot artichoke and spinach dip for the table... yum!  Good thing I worked out this morning, because I didn't feel quite as guilty enjoying this delicious appetizer - it was really tasty, and a generous portion too!Of course, my friends Rachel and Lesley ordered the soup as planned - they both seemed to enjoy it.  I went with the Cobb salad.  It was your standard Cobb - with chicken, romaine and iceberg, diced tomato, egg, bleu cheese crumbles, avocado slices, chopped bacon, and balsamic dressing which I requested on the side.  It was good, but I think I was full from the chips and artichoke/spinach dip appetizer, so I couldn't finish it all.  Too full for dessert as well...I'll have to return to Wally's for sure though - they had a pretty impressive bar menu with a ton of liquor, beer, and martinis too!  I noticed they had a kids menu, and some of my favorite desserts as well (hot apple pie and carrot cake).  Wally's happy hour is from 4-6p M-F with $1 off cocktails & beer and $2 off all appetizers... I'll be back for more of that artichoke and spinach dip with a beer or 2 next time for sure!  See you there!What a great neighborhood restaurant! The atmosphere is cozy and friendly, the food is tasty and the prices are reasonable. What more can you ask for? We came here for dinner and sat at the bar but will definitely take advantage of their spacious outdoor patio next time. I ordered the veggie burger with a honey glaze coat which was amazing! My husband got the French dip and I stole a delicious bite. I want to order that next time. The sides were the best because they provide a mix of regular fries, sweet potato fries and onion rings! Perfection!

Well, I'll have to begin by explaining (in answer to Gene's question about the sushi/pizza combo) that this is a kosher place. No, that does not mean that a rabbi has blessed you pizza. It does mean that the cheese on the pizza is vegetarian (i.e. no rennet);this is a vegetarian jointand it has a zany and off-the-wall menu which now includes a Mexican night (Wednesday?).I am a pizza snob to the core. King Solomon's has been hit or miss in the past as it has changed ownership a couple of times. I wanted to revisit today before writing a review. I ordered the lunch special- two slices and a drink for $5.99. The slices are AZ size as opposed to NY size. This is just fine by me- two slices fill me up nicely. The sauce is generous and flavorful. There was just a little too much cheese for me, which means it's light on the cheese for your average Zonie. The crust is thin and crisp.I have heard mixed reviews concerning the Israeli platter. I have not heard anything about sushi or Mexican here.Warning: KS is closed on shabbos: sundown Friday to sundown Saturday. Saturday night it opens and is subsequently flooded with families.Great place. Go.

You would never know it from the sign out front, but this little convenience store on 56th Street and Indian School is quite a gem!  I've been in a few times over the years for a drink or a snack or what have you, but today, I decided to go pick up a sandwich, and I was super impressed!"Proudly featuring Boar's Head," says the sticker on the saran wrap that sealed my sandwich, and it's featured on the sandwich board as well.  Boar's Head = quality, or so my husband has ingrained in my head.  He grew up on the stuff in Jersey!  Back to my sandwich... I ordered the turkey with the works on a wheat roll.  ($5.59) It was ready in minutes and totally hit the spot.  My only complaints were that they don't offer avocado and the store has a very limited chip selection.  (note to store - please order some sun chips!)On a positive note, they have picnic tables outside, although I took my sandwich to go.  I'll be back to this deli / market for sure - I live and work super close by!

My lunch here was just okay. Only prob is that I it took so long to get the food here. Not to mention the taste level is pretty much mediocre. Probably even lower. Service here was slow, or is it because it was just my unlucky day. In short, I had a not-so-good time here.

Emphasis on the family restaurant, with family (whose?) photos on the walls.  Open, clean, bright ambiance.  Servers were efficient and friendly.  The breakfast menu was limited and not very appealing.  The coffee was okay.  I ordered the Giant Cinnamon Roll but was told they were out.  This was at 9:00 AM.  How do you run out with two hours left of breakfast?   I then ordered the Loaded Omelet.  It was, indeed, loaded with sausage, ham, bacon, veggies, and cheese.  It needed some seasoning and a bit more flavor but wasn't that bad.  On the side was fried potatoes and gravy.  It was good, but my doctor would kill me if she saw me eating that.  Definite artery clogger.  In all it wasn't bad but also not someplace I'd return, even to taste the elusive cinnamon roll.  NOTE: There are references in the other reviews that hint at prejudice, such as "be stared at for your entire meal if you happen to not be Caucasian."   While I was there, a black couple came in and seemed to be known by the staff and was greeted warmly.  An interracial couple later came in.  I saw no "staring" or any such behavior.

They knew. They knew we were a rowdy, tipsy, cuss strewn restaurant gang. And they put us in back. Didn't matter. The entire room was magnificent. Carved concrete block. Mission style furniture blended with contemporary. Three ambiguously sexual servers. Really. How can you tell now days? But the food. The art on a plate. Sublime. And I don't even know what sublime means. I heard it on TV once. Just sounds good. Like the food I fed my pie hole last night. Perfectly seared sea scallop with a corn succotash, a Caesar salad so perfect AND served in a baked Parmesan crisp. That means, my dairy loving friends, that you consume the salad and then eat the bowl. Just like freakin' Dairy Queen. Damn! Filet Mignon, demi glace, baby veggies and the cutest little Dutch potatoes. Ever. Chocolate. Chocolate. Chocolate. Dessert was a chocolate cup with house made vanilla bean ice cream, crisp banana wafers with milk chocolate and German chocolate mousse cake. Toe curling happiness.It was so good I had start cutting myself. And pull out my hair. Both very trendy disorders. I hadn't had Cain Cuvee in years and it's great to know it's a meritage you can stick with. It was a magical evening. Oddly none of the Biltmore staying, tattoo adorned (yes it was indeed an interesting and large fellowship), churchgoers were dining here. Rumor has it they were eating Fritos, watching reruns of Highway to Heaven and deciding if the croquet field looked like a crucifix.

Review Text :
I dig this place. It's the closest thing to a sure thing in the area for me as far as Mexican food is concerned. The shrimp fajitas rock, as do the fish tacos, which are made with grilled pacific Hawaiian Ono - I think they come with corn tortillas, but they'll gladly trade those out for flour if you ask nice. They also come with a super tasty chipotle cream dipping sauce, but not enough in my opinion. Ask for more, they'll bring it. For vegetarians I recommend the mushroom enchiladas blancas or the spinach enchiladas, both of which are equally delicious - and rich. Bring the Lactaid if you're lactose intolerant. Oh, and apparently they've got a killer lunch menu - not sure how I've been going there for years and didn't know that. Oh, well, maybe it's because I usually go for dinner. Margarita ordering tip: go for broke. The base margarita blows. Yeah, it's way cheaper, but it tastes like you're drinking pure sweet & sour mix. Order their top shelf, whatever it is, I don't remember, think I had one too many last time I was there.This was the second time I have been to Ajo Al's.  The first time was about 10 years ago when I first visited Phoenix.  I remembered it well.  I like the atmosphere.  Warm and welcoming, lots of cool are and things to look at.  I did not know this was a chain until I read the other reviews.  This is no Chevy's though.  This is far better, in my opinion.  The chips and salsa are fresh and flavorful and plentiful.  The basket they bring you is huge!  I had chicken flautas and they were delicious.  They topped them with guac and pico de gallo.  The rice was fluffly and moist and the beans were good too.  I only had ice tea but that was some of the best ice tea I have ever had.  I don't know what made it so good.......I mean it's ice tea, but I downed two glasses of it in no time flat.  I know there are tons of other non-chain mexican places in Phoenix and I will try them all!!  I love mexican food!!  But I will come back to Ajo Al's too.  I'd like to try a margarita next time.  :)

Um, hello, this place has been open for over 60 years.  On that fact  alone they receive 5 stars from me.Do they have some magic type of fryers that no one else in the world has? I think so because I honestly couldn't tell my meal was fried at all. I had the fish, shrimp, and chips combo and every item was crispy, light, and as ungreasy as fried food can get.  The interior is old and outdated for sure and it's totally in the "hood" but who cares.  Darn good fish and chips IMHO.  ---PS, they have one of those pump thingies of ranch on their condiment bar so even if you don't like your meal just cover it in good old American ranch dressing.     Ranch makes everything better!Do I really have to give them even one star? In the area so i dropped in for a quick lunch.  Had the shrimp plate with fries. Here goes:1.  The prices are outrageously high considering location, restaurant decor and quality of food. You cannot have lunch here for less than $11 unless you order one shrimp.  Any local chinese buffet will give you shrimp for a lot less than that.2. My shrimp looked like long barrels rather than a shrimp shape. This is due to the fact that they cut the shrimp in the middle and almost split it to make it look longer.3.  The shrimp had too much batter.  At one point the "shrimp"( what was left of it after I took a bite), came out and the "barrel of fried batter" was left4.  The french fries were from a bag --frozen.Being from the East Coast, I know what fresh seafood tastes like. This is NOT it folks.  This place makes Long John Silver seem like a 5 star restaurant and it's a lot cheaper too.  It is an outrage as a "restaurant".  All they do is fry up every piece of seafood that YOU can buy frozen at CostCo or Sam's.Don't do this to yourself.  When you are in the area and hungry, go to the Jack in the Box across the street or some other fast food place. You'll be better off. and.... I cannot believe that the people who gave this place 4  and 5 stars are for real. They have to be the relatives of the owners.  There is no other explanation.

I am a carnivore.  There, I said it!  I love burgers!!  So of course when I drove by Chicago Hamburger Co. on my first week here in Phoenix I said "note to self......MUST try this place!".  Today marks my second week here in Phoenix and after a long week at my new job, I was hungry.  I picked up my daughter and we headed over.  First off if you are from Chicago or love Chicago, this is your place!  It is filled with memorabilia from the Windy City.  There are all sorts of street signs and things pertaining to Chicago plastered on the walls.  It's pretty cool.  They have two TV's and of course they had the Cubs playing on one of them!  Go Cubs!!  I like the sports like ambience.  It's nothing fancy at all, just basic tables and chairs and a few booths.  Now for the food.......Mmmmm good burger!  I had a wester burger.  For you fans of Carl's Jr. Western Bacon Cheeseburger....oh man, this one is far better!!  Real bacon right off the grill and cooked just right, nice and crisp, bbq sauce, cheese, and onion rings to top it off.  The burger was juicy and cooked just right!!  It was one of the best burgers I've had in awhile.  My daughter had a hot dog and scarfed it down and gave it a thumbs up so I knew it was good.  The onion rings were nice and crisp and I liked the batter they used.  Not super greasy either.  Nice!  The fries where crisp on the outside and fluffy on the inside...perfect!  They have Pepsi and the other usual sodas.  They also make milkshakes.  I'll have to try one next time.  Oh, and chili cheese fries......omg....I love those!  All in all this is gonna be one of my go to places here in Phoenix.  YUM!!!CHC is a valley institution. I've been a happy customer since I was a kid. Bob the owner is always happy to see you and is a great guy. At CHC the sliders are the stars of the show. Get several and be a happy camper. Also don't miss their shakes and fried zucchini.

Review Text :
Man-oh-man, this place is da bomb! The So and I came in on a Wednesday night after slamming a few Long Islanders at the bar next door, so we were geared up for some serious grubbing. We were seated immediately and greeted by our server Alberto. Wow, this guy had a golden personality and was working his station like a champ. He was making great conversation with every table and attended to us like royalty. We ordered the fried zucchini & mushroom plate and a medium pepperoni pizza. The friend zucchini and shrooms were very tasty and we were provided plenty of ranch for dipping. Our pizza was delivered to our table still bubbling and with a warning from Alberto, "Now you two take it easy, this pizza is Super HOT and I can tell you from experience because I no longer have the roof of my mouth, Enjoy". So I lifted the toasty-melty-saucy slice up to my face, hoisted it into my mouth, sank my fangs into it, and almost fainted with pleasure. I swear I could hear Lou Rawls singing in my ear as I worked my way down the slice to the crust. This was one hell of a Pizza and a great price to boot. Dinner (Appetizer, Pizza, and Root Beer) for two under 20 bucks. I may have to give in and be a repeat offender next week. Oh well, I'll just tell them the Devil made me do it.(This review is for take-out service)Most people have a 'go-to' list of their favorite comfort food places, and emergency list that is used when you need tasty, predictable, and reliable. Red Devil Pizza is at the top of my list for great NY style pizza. Forgetting fancy pizza, this place offers really tasty pizza, at a good price for what you get. Red Devil uses quality ingredients, and doesn't 'church it up' (with apologies to Joe Dirt).If you are ready for an extra treat, ask for your pie to be 'well done', that gets you a bit of char on the crust, and takes it from good to great. The guys behind the takeout window work hard to make some of the best pie in the 602, so enjoy!I usually throw away those value pack coupon envelopes you get in the mail, but decided to look at them this time & see if I'd use any. I pulled out ones for the dry cleaners, zoo, a burger/hot dog joint & Red Devil. Most of them were for dine in only but a couple were for delivery as well, so I used the one that was for a 16" cheese (toppings were an additional $1.25 each) & 20 wings for $21.95. I had looked at their website before ordering & the combo (pepperoni, sausage, onions, mushrooms & green peppers-but we skipped the onions) sounded delish so we got that with the NY mild wings. They don't have their desserts listed on their website so I asked the guy who placed our order & decided on the cannolis (1 for me, 1 for hubs). He said it would be a lil over an hour & to my surprise it arrived in 45 minutes.The pizza was good, not Mamma Mia's good, but good! The wings were bomb; crispy, the right amount of sauce & they smelled amazing! The cannolis were pretty good but we didn't really prefer their "style". Instead of chocolate chips inside with the filling, the entire cannoli was dipped in chocolate. Total with coupon, $3 delivery fee & tip was $47. Not bad at all considering we will each be getting 2 or more meals out of it. We're fans & would definitely order from them again...maybe even dine in eventually!It isn't trendy.  It isn't fancy.  The chef isn't famous.  It is just plain good.I like Red Devil.  It is one of those places where ordering way too much pizza on purpose in order to enjoy it again for lunch the next day is perfectly normal and A-OK.  The service is consistently friendly, attentive, and happy to offer menu suggestions.  I can't comment on their wide variety of main dishes (which all look appetizing), because I can never tear myself away from the pizza.  What goes great with that pizza?  The Antipasto salad is fantastic - loaded with meats, cheese and even my favorite artichoke hearts.  A small is more than ample for two people to share.  Save some of that Italian dressing (presented on the side) to use as a dipping sauce for your pizza crust.  Instant breadsticks!  Speaking of pizza, Red Devil's graces a thin yet doughy crust with tangy sauce and generous evenly-distributed toppings.  My favorite, pepperoni and mushroom, tastes wonderful when re-heated for lunch the next day too!Go, sit in one of the bar's padded booths.  Enjoy an adult beverage or two (there are typically drink specials of some kind or another) and order a pizza big enough to take some home.  :)

Ick.It was one of those evenings when you toss dinner options back and forth, but nothing really sticks.  In retrospect, we should have stayed home.  Even in the barren, food-less space that is my kitchen, I could have done better.  However, lured by an ad boasting a "World Famous Gyro" for the bargain price of $5, off we went.Upon arrival, we were quickly greeted by a man I assume is the owner, shown to a table, and given menus.  A few minutes later, he came back to tell us he would send someone over to take our order.  Great.  Strangely, the waitress that arrived to ask us what we would like to drink couldn't/wouldn't take our food order, as someone else was actually our waiter.  Huh?  Well, we finally were able to order from our real waiter (who was very nice, by the way and the ONLY reason for 2 stars vs 1) and our World Famous Gyros arrived shortly.  Uh, no.  What I found on my plate was a pile of sauce wrapped in paper.  The entire gyro was drowning in tzatziki.  Now I happen to really like tzatziki, but but not to the point that I cannot even identify what I am supposed to be eating.  I scraped off as much as I could, but then only tasted overly salty meat, soggy lettuce and yes, sauce.  After a few bites, I waved the white flag of surrender - I just couldn't do it.Guess you get what you pay for....

After pigging out in SF for 10 days I made Gabi K promise to only take me to healthy restaurants during my trip to Phoenix. As soon as she picked me up from the airport she made good on that promise by taking me to Taylor's for lunch.I was leading towards ordering a fresh fruit bowl or maybe even a yogurt parfait when Gabi started raving about their tuna that's made with yogurt! How's that for healthy? And so I ordered this tuna in a wheat wrap (instead of the regular bread). My side choices were fries, greens, and sweet potato fries.  Since I'm trying to be healthy I knew I should get the greens, but turning down sweet potato fries is just silly! And so I ordered the sweet potato fries, which at least are healthier than regular fries! Well, my sweet potato fries never came to the table because the waitress soon informed me that the kitchen was out of sweet potato fries. A sign that I should have ordered those greens in the first place!The tuna wrap lived up to expectations and we received top notch service (thanks to our waiter Michael) throughout our meal.  I started to think I was in SF instead of Phoenix when the homeless man outside started soliciting us for money through the window, but Michael had a chat with him within minutes.Gabi K seems to be a regular here and I can see why....can't beat healthy, tasty food and fabulous service! Even if they run out of sweet potato fries from time to time...Why did I not visit here before??  I don't know how many spontaneous stops I've made at AJ's for sweets in the past... Had I known about Taylor's Cafe being just next door, I'd have stopped in for organic and locally-produced foods, instead of spending money on junk!  Am so glad I took the time to drive all the way to have brekky here-- I also found this plaza to be a quaint area to walk around.  Lots of nooks and crannies that hold promise for other good eats.  Any suggestions?Before stopping by, I briefly looked at the online menu and spotted Smoked Salmon listed.  However, upon inquiry, I was told that the salmon isn't wild-caught, so I had to bypass :(  But I wasn't disheartened much, though, since I was also hit with a major sweet craving (thanks to yesterday's viewing of "The Best Thing I Ever Ate: Sugar Rush," on DVR, while on the treadmill!), so I had the French Toast , made w/ two slices of Simply Bread's monkey bread (cinnamon pull-apart), strawberries, bananas, and a triple berry compote.  I also had a side order of Boar's Head smoked bacon.  I had asked for the toast to be "more well-done."  The same went for the bacon-- delicious!  [I'm crossing my fingers they weren't made w/ allergenic ingredients (I suspect they were), bec. I'd like to buy a package of this to prepare at home.]  I enjoyed every morsel of the French toast!  Loved the texture of the cinnamon-swirl bread, which I lavishly topped w/ the compote and fruit.  (I kept thinking I should ask for extra compote, but the portion was actually just right.  I would've enjoyed an extra slice of toast, though, but that's the monster in me with bigger eyes than my stomach talking!)  I also had a cup (or two!) of the special blend coffee, made by Starbucks, which I tempered its bitterness with a little 2% milk.  Great spot for breakfast!  Can't wait to try lunch here soon.  Too bad Taylor's Cafe isn't open for dinner anymore, or I'd plan for that, as well.  BTW, service was very friendly and fast!  While my server Kristen couldn't readily address my food issues, she was quick to offer to ask kitchen staff for the answers.  And she did this with sincere smiles, which I really appreciate!  Thank you, Kristen!Lovely murals; sectioned rooms that vibrate with differing, but positive, energies; polished and clean women's restroom; and nice furnishings complete my breakfast adventure this morning and make this cafe a winner!  Can't wait to come back, and I'm saying this as I finish off this review here at Taylor's Cafe!!

Low expectations. That's what I had when we stopped to have a bite before a movie. Not a big fan of deep dish, we were delighted to see "flat bread" pizzas offered. The sausage pizza, while could have been crunchier, was quite good. Service was great considering our friend was so dehydrated from being overserved the previous evening, he must have had a dozen ice tea refills. The ambience at these places kills me. It's like Oregano's married Cracker Barrel! There is crap all over the walls. Hey. Who's dusting this stuff anyway. I did notice quite a bit of dust and grease on the light fixture above our table. We attempted to try the pizza place a few doors away, but they were closed. I suggested Hooter's but before I finished saying it, we all squealed in all of our gayness...."Ewww...boobies!". So Uno it was. But I couldn't help think of that card game Uno. Damn that's a fun game. And I also couldn't get a guy from high school outta my head. His nickname was Uno. He got it one day in the locker room after gym class. You figure it out. I'll go again if I'm ever at the AZ Center. I just might bring my Windex and Endust however.

I liked Mandy's because: * It's right off the light rail, so I can travel from work to here in a matter of minutes without having to deal with traffic. * Their catfish is wonderfully crispy and flavorful, pulled freshly out of the fryer. * They serve catfish all week long. But I'm not crazy about: * Those odd crackhead sitting behind me acting like they were playing hookie from high school. * The amount of time it took to prepare my meal. (Okay, this is one of those "I want it fresh but I want it fast" so I'll nullify the weight of this one. * Decor was nonexistent. If you're going and have limited time for lunch, I'd recommend calling in your order. All in all a very nice lunch and a good excuse to ride the rail over lunch.

Ok, Ok, Ok another strip mall restaurant in Phoenix. I get it. We can be a fab place in a drab space. Wow, how cool, I just came up with a new motto. But let me just say, PCG, as the regs call it, is a FAB place. Voted many times as a local hot spot or a great neighborhood spot, PCG actually shines on many levels. Yes, the space itself is not inventive or trendy. But why do we go out to eat? Mostly for some killer ass food. Well, you got it here sister. Appetizer: bacon wrapped shrimp stuffed with cotija....yowzaaa yowzaa Potsie. Yummy! The tenderloin rivals Ruth's Chris and any other high end steak place. The corn cakes are, well, let's just say I'd raffle off a limb for these babies. Pot roast is right off my Momma Jo's dining room table. The pork  tenderloin entree makes Miss Piggy cry and me, well I'm weeping already. Juicy, firm white meat with amazing sides. Services runs always a Bplus to and Aplus. Waitstaff knows everyone and is literally family to the owners and management. I LOVE it here. Now, the space. Yes, it's a mini mall. But they've made it iintimate and not sports bar like. The gang here has made a home run on  every level. It's like coming home everytime I eat here. EAT AT PCG people. It'll give strip malls a new meaning!The corn cakes and the bacon wrapped prawns. I would sell my mother for them. Does that make me a bad person? Or just really, really hungry?Phoenix City Grill is an institution, and it should be. My second dinner out, after I moved here with the Beautiful Carin, was at PCG (the first was at Tuchetti's, dear departed Tuchetti's...maybe not the best Italian food in town, but truly...was there ever a dish that could fill you up like their baked spaghetti with meat sauce?...it must have been 5 lb's. of food on the plate...my dear sweet lord).Anyway...I met a friend at PCG for lunch yesterday. I didn't get to pick...I don't get to pick the restaurants for client and friend lunches for a while...not since the sad and regrettable Frank & Lupe's incident.But, I was glad for change of pace...out of Old Town and my rut of wanting to walk everywhere I go. I fired up the Edsel and off I went to 16th and Bethany Home for a revisit of a Phoenix classic!PCG is PDG ("pretty damn good") food and attentive service.Mark had gotten there a little before me and gotten a table. The waitress was there as I was sitting down. Interestingly, Mark had gotten a big ol' glass of red wine to start lunch...a delightful way of lunching for business people that has fallen into disrepute over the past decade or so. I followed suit.We must fight this non-drinking at lunch scourge by taking every opportunity to imbibe at lunch, and I, for one, will help lead the fight!The menu hasn't changed very much over the past few years, but really, why screw around with what is working...the place is always full, everybody seems to enjoy their meals, including me BTW:), and they just go on printing money, year after year! What's not to like about that formula?They had some nice specials (including a bunch of seafood specials), but frankly, I rarely eat seafood at non-seafood specialty restaurants in the middle of the desert. I opted for the Cuban Hamburger. A novel preparation, one that was highlighted by some of the tastiest pickles I have ever had on a burger! I actually do taste the food as I hoover it down:)PCG is still doing great and doesn't need anything more from me than my credit card for payment when the check comes...keep up the good work!I went to add this to my newly made list of favorite brunch spots and couldn't believe my eyes.. I hadn't reviewed PCG yet!?!If someone were to ask me what my favorite brunch dish was, without batting an eye I would respond "Griddled corn cakes from PCG of course". Take corn cakes and cook them to perfection (you know with a few corn kernels stuck in there), stuff them with chicken, green chillis, jack cheese, serve them with salsa fresco, potatoes and black beans. This would also probably be my last meal on earth if I had a choice. You feeling my taste buds? It honestly doesn't get any better. Outside of brunch, the food here is amazing.  The Rose Lane Chicken, The Surf and Turf, any of the fish dishes.. Everything is made with quality ingredients nothing fancy and full of flavor. They do it right. I held my college graduation dinner here it is that good. I would recommend this to the pickiest of eaters, and it is great for groups.There aren't as many places with the service and friendly staff as PCG!  I've only been there for the Yelp event, but I will definitely go back based solely on the treatment we all got from the staff.The food was amazing with combos that were perfect.  The coconut shrimp was my very favorite and I am always down for fruit and cheese.This place is very close to home and I will become a regular, whether they like it or not.Phoenix City Grille knocked my socks off with some special treats they dazzled us with at a CMYE (Community Manager Yelp Event) and I recently returned with the generous buy-one-get-one voucher they sent us home with (it expires on the 30th, fellow Yelpers who haven't redeemed theirs yet). After the delicious scallops at our Yelp event, you can guess what I had my heart set on -- hopeful that there would be a special, since they are not a regular menu offering. Fortunately for me, there was a short rib and scallop special. It was accompanied by fried green beans. The sort rib was good. Definitely tender with a real hearty, rich, beefy flavor. There was only 1 scallop. It was a little tougher than the ones showcased at our event. Trying to minimize the calories, I asked for plain green beans instead. The kitchen sent out the fried which our server quickly noted and corrected, leaving the fried ones for my dinner partner to enjoy. Lacking any substantive willpower, I nibbled one or two and they were quite tasty. A light tempura coating combined with the cooking technique offered a unique, enjoyable flavor. My "plain" green beans were dressed in olive oil with garlic, salt and pepper (just like I make at home). Still crisp, they were delicious! So, I got my wish with the special, but the the regular menu challenges decision-making abilities with so many great options! My friend got the beef tenderloin and it was, quite possibly, the best steak I've had in the Valley. It was fabulously tender (even cooked medium well) and perfectly seasoned. I look forward to ordering one for myself on a future visit. I had heard about the bread pudding from the CMYE reviews and so we splurged with dessert. It was phenomenal! Think the fluffiest, most custardy french toast flavor you've ever had! Thank goodness it was cut into two pieces -- better for a peaceful sharing. Another tip from the CMYE, thanks to Don S., I tried the Brophy Clark Pinot Noir ($11/glass) and it was love at first sip! I liked it so much, I called Total Wine to see about buying a bottle for home and searched the vineyard's website for where to buy a bottle in Arizona but didn't get very far. I guess I'll have to add that to the reasons to return to Phoenix City Grille!PCG cannot fail to please. i have been twice now, once for a yelp event and once to use the coupon they gave me at said yelp event. Both times i was blown away by the delicious food i had here. The follow up visit i brought my best friend, the lovely Barbara G and we had an excellent time!The service is great, and i am especially fond of the waiter who took care of me both visits, gosh i wish i could remember his name...but without sounding...a little...too...glaad...not that there's anything wrong with that! he was a very handsome man....but i was genuinely impressed that he remembered me from the yelp event, and both visits his serving skillz were right on par. kudos! when we sat down and perused the menu I was still a little "dazed and confused" from my morning rituals *ahem* and everything on the menu sounded ridiculously good to me, it was getting so hard to make up my mind, i was floundering until my lovely friend Barbara suggested the bacon bleu cheese burger, a girl after my own heart!We then both ordered said burger, a coke for her and a pabst for myself. We gnoshed on those delicious burgers accompanied w/ garlic horseradish mashed potatoes ooooweee! Here was a dish that was so perfectly flavoured and well thought out and deceptively simple. without a shadow of doubt one of the best burgers i've had in phx. I would recommend PCG to any and all, and look forward to when i make my return.Matt and I dined here for our Christmas Eve dinner. Since this was the first time I didn't make the trip home to San Francisco for Christmas, I had absolutely no idea what to do with my Christmas Eve. Matt and I need plans! Therefore, after doing some investigative work on the internet as to what Arizonians can do in Phoenix on Christmas Eve, I came across PCG and their special menu for the holiday. Their prime rib and sea bass specials looked mouthwatering so I made reservations. In the end, this place did not disappoint!! I will unquestionably be back. I started out with a strong and tart pomegranate margarita that wasn't too sweet. I don't like it when margaritas are sugary so this one was perfect, and a great way to get my Christmas festivities started. For my main course I opted to try the sea bass special. It came with almond crusted asparagus and some garlicky (and insanely buttery) rosemary mashed potatoes. How would I describe the entire meal? In one word, perfection! That sea bass was so fresh and delicious it practically swam right up to my plate. You can't really go wrong with asparagus but this wasn't just your regular vegetable. They coated the asparagus with a crunchy layer of almonds and it was soooooo tasty. And yeah, the mashed potatoes tasted like they had about 5 cubes of butter in them... but that's the best way to make em!I wish I had known about this place sooner because it really is such a delightful restaurant. The atmosphere isn't too lively but it isn't too dull. Tons of families, friends and large groups filled the interior so PCG really suits any age demographic. I loved the decorations that they had up for Christmas, and I highly recommend dining here for any holiday. They really do an all around excellent job at providing an awesome dining experience. When I was there I also noticed that they have a really nice bar with an even nicer happy hour... so once I get the chance, I'm going to head right back here and try it out! Everyone in AZ needs to know about this place. It's one of those solid classic restaurants you can go to for pretty much any occasion. 5 stars to PCG!PCG is a really good, reliable place to grab some good food and drinks. Sometimes the service is amazing, sometimes it's pretty good, but it is always a safe bet.I recommend the cheeseburgers and margaritas. They are very tasty and pair nicely. The atmosphere is very comfortable, dark and cozy. This is a local spot, and neighbors use it as an excuse not to make dinner at home. Give PCG a try, and it will likely be in your standard rotation, and you won't be disappointed.  The only area I think PCG could improve is with desserts. As good as the meals are, the desserts just aren't as good or enticing- which is not to say they are bad, just not on par with the rest of the place.Walking into PCG on a recent Sunday for brunch, I wasn't sure what to expect.  The place was pretty much empty.  Coming off a few less than stellar recent brunch attempts at other local spots (why is it so hard to find good Eggs Benedict!?), I took this to be a less than favorable sign about the meal ahead...  Well, I was wrong...  PCG served some of my favorite things!A mimosa with fresh-squeezed OJ started things off nicely.   :) On to an appetizer - yes, even brunch deserves an appetizer!  I was happy to see Jumbo Bacon-Wrapped Shrimp on the menu.  Now that Wildfish no longer serves them, I have been hunting for a new favorite.  These were delicious - 4 large shrimp, stuffed with cojita cheese and wrapped in bacon - perfect with the accompanying chipotle-lime aioli.And last, the main event.  The Tenderloin Eggs Benedict was fantastic.  Two English muffins graced with generous slices of medium-rare tenderloin, poached (not overdone - hooray!) eggs and tangy hollandaise.  This masterpiece came with diced breakfast potatoes (not greasy at all!) and a small bowl of fresh fruit.  Yum!  Thank you, PCG, for renewing my faith in brunch.The Phoenix City Grill was described by friends as their local "Cheers" bar. Well, I have to tell you something. Although a Norm *does* frequent this joint I'd rather come here ANY day over the tv version. This place is swank! (Sorry friends. Your description needs tweaking.)I met my friends at the bar area. I parked out back and walked in via the kitchen area. I did NOT, however, realize I would be walking through a full on kitchen. NOPE. I closed the door in confusion. Double-checked the sign outside that said, "Enter Here" and proceeded. A very understanding employee provided me "directions" to the bar. The bar zig zags around to the hostess stand. This is nice so everyone is not lined up like soldiers and conversations flows. There are standing height tables in the bar area as well. The restaurant section has booths (noted on the way to the bathroom) and copious seating. There is also a private room for events behind the elegant wall of wine.Using the company's weekly email we scored a free appetizer. The "Red chile pork tacos" come two to a plate and are divine. Grilled pork tenderloin w/chipotle aioli & pineapple fennel salsa. YUM.Having had a late lunch I could not possibly justify a decadent dinner. But I desperately wanted to after the tacos. Alas, no. Instead, I enjoyed a mouthwatering cup of the daily soup (Friday is the chicken tortilla). The group shared something called "Crispy Eggplant Bites". Goodness!Red pepper relish, goat cheese, arugula and a sherry vinaigrette are layered over a crispy heavenly crunchy shell. What this heaven is made of I should have asked. But no, I was too busy inhaling to inquire. (Four to a plate. Big enough for a group to share. IMO. However, I could see a tipsy person opting not to. This stuff is seriously good!)I also fork sampled my neighbor's plate "The Original Griddled Corn Cakes". This is a neat mixture of sweet, spice and well, cheese. And I like cheese!I'd say I'd come back and eat these things again. But NO. I want to try different things *next* time. Brunch looks a-m-a-z-i-n-g. So does lunch. And all the great entrees I had to pass on. (Aww man!)With a full belly I understood the "Cheers" reference. You come here repeatedly. If you sit in the bar area look for Jose, JP & David. All three bartenders seamlessly moved between guests without missing a beat. Our glasses were never empty.  Even though we were waited on by all three of them service was transparent.Oh! And keep an eye out for the owner, Sheldon. He's making the rounds and greeting guests too!This place is super popular for good reason. If you're coming for a special occasion or with a larger group (which they can readily accommodate) I'd recommend a reservation.

Review Text :
Bodrick's(family owned and operated) has been serving pit cooked bbq in the Charlotte area for 12 years and I am ashamed to say that I just recently got a chance to experience it.......I have definitely been missing out!I've been in Charlotte 16 years, and visited several bbq spots.....some that quite honestly shouldn't still be in existence and Bodrick's simply puts them all to shame. I'd put their rib tips, ribs, and bbq up against any of the local bbq spots without a doubt.....it's just that darn good. I'm talking about tender busting with smokey flavor meat with a kicking sauce! They call it 'Chi-town style', but I call it bbq done right!  The rib tips and bbq are their specialty but understand that they serve much more than that.....I also tried the lemon pepper wings, hush puppies, potato salad, mac n cheese, fries and lemonade which were all 5 star and easily, in my opinion, pushes them into the bbq/soulfood arena.....seriously! I can't wait to try the fish and shrimp on my next trip.   If I could suggest one thing, it would be to add bbq pulled chicken or turkey to your menu for the health fanatic in me:-)  Bodrick and his wife were a pleasure to talk with and they know bbq, and to the brother cooking.....you are the man!You'd be doing yourself a terrible injustice to sleep on this one as I had........

Here is the deal.  You have to ask for the Chinese menu.  I am not saying this is right but if you are anything other than Chinese, they will hand you the "American" menu.  DO NOT GO THERE!!  Ask for the Chinese menu.  This is the BEST Chinese restaurant that I have eaten at in the states.  I lived in China for a year and this is truely authentic western China food.  I spent a couple months in Sichuan province in the west and you are getting exactly what is served there.  Try the "yu xiang rou si" literally translated, fish smelling small pieces of meat.  It is julienned pork in a wonderful sauce that DOES NOT  have any fish flavor or smell at all.  It is SO good.  One of my favs.  Also try the julienned potato with green pepper, wonderful!!  Ma Po Dou Fu is very traditional of the Sichuan province and known all over the country.  These guys make it right using the star anise which gives heat and a numbing quality of the mouth.  If this happens, it is authentic.  You will know what I mean when you have it.  Sichuan food is a bit oily which is authentic, a chile oil to warm them, since in the west up in the mountains that lead up to Tibet (known as the Gateway to Tibet) where the winters are very cold.Cha-ching! I got lucky my first time at Szechwan Palace! I had Helen Y. with me (Jason W. was along for the culinary experience as well), and she helped us navigate the Chinese menu, explaining about Szechwan cuisine and selecting some different dishes for us to try. I don't remember everything we tried, but the two standout dishes were definitely the fish filets and the water-boiled beef. The fish was cooked perfectly, with a creamy texture and a simple, sweet flavor. The water-boiled beef was spicy and so satisfying - my sinuses totally felt clearer as I ate it! I also enjoyed the soup buns. I'm not a big lamb fan, but the lamb riblets that Helen described in her review were good and would probably be a big hit with anyone who doesn't mind the gamier taste. The restaurant's atmosphere isn't anything to write home about, but the service was decent and the prices (about $15 a person) were definitely really reasonable for the amount and quality of the food we tried. Thanks to Helen for introducing me to this place. When I go back with my husband (or anyone else who can't read the Chinese menu), at least I will have a few already-established favorites to order!If you like spicy food, this Sichuan spot has your name written all over it!  Known as one of the Four Great Traditions of Chinese cuisine, Sichuan food can be described as spicy, hot, fresh and fragrant. When you are seated, if you are white, they will give you the "Whitey Menu".  Politely ask for the "Zhangguó cài dan" or "Chinese Menu" and you will be presented with a nice, leather bound, menu filled with the best this place has to offer.  I have tasted about 9 dishes from this place and each one was excellent. A word of warning, their hottest dishes are the "Water Boiled xxxxx" dishes literally drowning in mouth-numbing Sichuan peppercorns and can be a challenge for even the most seasoned spicy food lovers.  I believe they have toned it down a bit (I was actually told this by a 10-year vetran of this spot) and the last time I had it, it was significantly less spicy, but still about a 9 - 10 on a 10pt spicy scale.  Previously it was essentially inedible to my Nordic tongue, this last time it was enjoyable.... so buyer beware.I was going to go 4 stars, actually about 4.5, but given the fact that there is not a better Sichuan spot in AZ, it gets 5 stars.  Go, eat, enjoy.I AM AN IDIOTI've spent years bitching about the lack of even a DECENT chinese place near our house (Baja Arcadia). I kept looking to Scottsdale for somewhere to eat. We've got just about everything else, from real-deal taco shacks, to excellent Pho, to fine dining. But no real Chinese food. I was looking the wrong way. Up til recently, I would drive all the way to Wong's Place in Tempe just for the real stuff.THE CHINESE CULTURAL CENTERI shop regularly at what used to be Ranch99, that oasis in the desert that makes you feel like you've been transported to the Hell that is Riverside CA. I've tried numerous restaurants in the mall over the years and always been disappointed. The one I never managed to try is the Szechwan Palace. I expected it to be just another Gringonese disaster. Man was I wrong. We eat out maybe once or twice a week, and we've hit this place at least once a week since we found it a few months ago.SZECHWAN PALACEI love you, Palace. Dan Dan Noodles. Spice. Yu Xiang dishes. We've been when it's packed full of high maintenance Chinese businessmen and when we're one of 4 tables in the place. Every time, the tiny kitchen and the wonderful servers keep their smiles in place and just give you that little shake of the head that says: "Solly, it clazy tonight!" Even though this place pleases real Chinese food lovers, there's plenty of stuff to keep my Jewish mother-in-law happy too ("happy" is a relative term).THINGS I LOVE  - Wan Fu: the worst white wine in the world (that I love)  - Dan Dan Noodles with extra hot chile  - Yu Xiang Shrimp  - Mongolian Beef with real beef, not that over-marinated rubbery crap  - Fresh veggies that still have some color and snap to them  - Incredibly spicy Water-boiled dishes  - Any of their soupsWong's thick-skinned pot stickers are still the best, but everything else at the Palace rules.BOTTOM LINEIt's hard for me to imagine a bad review being credible unless some key person was missing or they were ridiculously understaffed and got slammed. We've been there for one of those nights though, and it was still very good, once we eventually got served. As others have said: get the real menu as you walk in. Otherwise, you'll get the Panda Express version. You'll also have to grab chopsticks. Other than that, just enjoy!Asked my friend where he wanted to go for his Birthday and this is where he choose.I had never been here before,so I was excited to try it out.Lots of parking here at the Chinese cultural Center.Nice looking place inside and out. The Cultural Center is a huge beautiful building. Something that Phoenix really needs. But, it looks as if there is quite a few empty business spots here.We were seated right away,but it did take a while to get our tea. Very quickly though they brought our soup. It was hot and Sour and was very good.The lunch specials are huge plates and you can choose white rice or Brown. No substitutions on anything ,which is the norm.They dropped off the check and you pay it at the front counter. But 3 people were up there and they were all yelling in Chinese at each other about something.Four patrons were waiting to check out in a line and the were not helping anyone. It was a bit crazy. But, luckily we were not in a hurry.Nice place but, I think I like Mui's in Tempe better. My kung pao was not that spicy for some reason.Still worth a try.Close to the Airport. It is a great location.

You can't beat their lunch special.  We walk over from CPCC a lot for lunch & it's cheap, tasty & you get quite a bit of food.  Be warned, if you order the entree dinner size, it's more than enough to feed 2 people!  We made the mistake of ordering 2 dinner sized entrees one night & had enough for 2 more meals.  Their beef & broccoli is delicious!

Review Text :
If I could give the Harmony less than one star, I would. I live in the Shenk-Atwood neighborhood, so I'm not writing as an outsider. I've been to the Harmony many times, but I'm finally done being abused by the notoriously unfriendly owner, bartenders and waitstaff at the Harmony. The Harmony is worse than Seinfeld's Soup Nazi because there's no irony or humor in being treated the way the employees here treat their customers. I won't get into specifics. I can only say that I take pride in my neighborhood. My wife and I frequent those establishments that understand that they are part of a community and treat their paying customers as such. The Harmony is a black mark on our neighborhood, and I am ashamed that unsuspecting visitors to the quaint east side should have to endure the abusive, disrespectful and generally unapologetic service at this establishment. If you scroll down you'll read other comments about the owner's girlfriend who is now manager. The last time I was in there with a group of friends, she couldn't have been more rude or insulting. When we all said we wouldn't be back, she merely shrugged her shoulders. If you're visiting the East Side, there are plenty of other places that serve great food with friendly service. Alchemy, Mickey's, Wilson's, The Weary Traveller all come to mind as places that will make you feel and taste the love on the East Side.  If you're a masochist, be sure to head on over The Harmony for your daily dose of abuse. You've been warned. You certainly won't catch me sitting at this bar ever again.

I rarely do fast food, but every now and then, I find it convenient, cheap, and oh so appealing, especially when fast food drive-thru windows exist!So, on a recent Sunday, upon realizing that I had two hungry kids in the car and nothing too appealing at the house to eat, I made my way toward El Pollo Loco, entered the drive-thru, and within 10 minutes, was headed home with a feast for all!I ordered a salad for myself, some chicken nuggets and sides of mac and cheese, corn, broccoli, and french fries for the kids.  However, I arrived home to find that they forgot to include the broccoli.  Bummer.I liked my salad and the kids liked the nuggets and fries.  The other stuff, not so much, but there's always something that doesn't get eaten at my house with 2 little ones that are hit and miss picky eaters.  I noticed El Pollo Loco offers some family style meals and everything is moderately priced, so I may just return again soon to try more from the menu.

Review Text :
This was actually the first time I've ever been to a Dave and Buster's.Walking into such a huge space, especially coming from the often narrow venues in San Francisco was strange.Un-nerving actually. Because Dave and Buster's is all about excess. Almost obscenely so.As far as food - their stuff is standard. Most of it is fried and as another reviewer pointed out - not very healthy. At all actually. You have to really scour the menu to find some somewhat decent viable and nutritious options.But most people don't come to Dave & Buster's for food. They come for the games.And while I've never been that into video games or arcade games - my brother and sister always have.  I was apprehensive about having a good time here  - but after awhile - my siblings' enthusiasm about the place became contagious and I found myself really enjoying myself.Especially once i realized that I have mad skills at Skee Ball. And proceeded to dominate.Trust.

Review Text :
This is the Wendys that made me never want to eat at Wendy's ever again.  To think I gave it a second a third and even a FOURTH try!  I guess convenience gets dollars but after so long, you'll stop getting mine.The employees here are always fighting when you go in about shift changed and duties and the attitude carries itself right over to the register.  The management isn't any better telling me to go somewhere else if I don't like it then.  This place is the reason people scoff at giving $15 a hr to fast food employees.  The frosty is never frosty always runny.  The burgers are slapped together and the dining room looks more like a daycare after a long day than a place you would want to sit down and eat.The only good thing about this place is the exit so you can swiftly leave and never come back.This Wendy's is not the best one in town, but the staff here is really sweet.  My co-workers and I go to Wendy's every Friday.  It is nice when you walk in the door and they say hi to us by name. Then when you order your food they already know what we would like to order.   The location of this Wendy's is across for the VA hospital.  So you will see a lot of doctors or nurse here and sometime patients.  I will say that this Wendy's could use a makeover.  Hopefully one day they will, and then people may want to actually eat here.

If you're like me, you probably enjoy watching people eat hot dogs and will want to make D's a destination when hanging in the 'burgh. What? I can't be the only one. Seriously? Fine. Then excuuuUUUuuuse me. I'll rephrase for the supposed masses.If you enjoy eating hot dogs, you'll want to make D's a destination when hanging in the 'burgh. It's a great place to go and get some tubed meat in a variety of different mix and match combinations and also a great place to meet new people... perhaps you'll even meet someone who shares your love of you eating hot dogs and you can shower them with many moments of which they can watch you eat your beloved wieners and y'all can live happily ever after. No? Ugh, fine. Then just eat the damn hot dog all by your lonesome. See if I care.I came in with a group of friends for a semi-liquid lunch and though it was the beer cave that brought us in, I was secretly more excited about watching my friends eat hot dogs. You see, I'd been feeling super sick for the entire duration on my Pittsburgh road trip. I think it was a bad Cholera strain. Anyway, my party of six allowed me to sleep in extra late while they wandered around some graveyard by our hotel with scones until I was all puked out and ready see what the light of day looks like. I was feeling bummed that I had to hibernate through my original morning plan of going to the zoo, but the thought getting to see my pals suck down chili dogs all Jack & Diane style really helped lift my spirits.We walked in, sat down and I was immediately excited to be sitting across from their epic celebrity mural. It's like a pop-culture/history 'Where's Waldo', only there's no Waldo, and instead Gandalf, Wolverine, John Candy, and more. I spent the entire time between ordering and the food coming out staring at the wall and finding new peeps. My only gripe on the artwork is that the mural was seriously lacking in Bill Murray biz-nasty, so for that I have to subtract a star. Okay, no. I'm only (half) joking about the star thing. I'm actually deducting the star because their veggie dog was pretty damn terrible. I mean, the toppings (I got the chihuahua with cheese and jalapenos) were fine, but I think I've microwaved dogs that tasted better than theirs. It was so freaking rubbery and tough and chewy... like bad calamari or trying to chew a whole pack of rock hard Bazooka Joe at once. My jaw was tired from trying to force my tearing teeth into that little soy sausage but the worst part is that I had to devote so much extra time to eating my stupid wiener that I missed being able to watch my friends eat their hot dogs. Boo-urns. Next time, I'll skip the veggie dog and go with a wrap or pizza or burger or something that'll allow for more wiener-peeping.On the other hand, the veggie pub fries were damn good and something I resented having to offer to share them with my friends... but I did offer because I felt like it would detract from them getting 'weirded out' at my wanting to gawk at them like I bought a ticket to watch them eat hot dogs... even though that wishful thought didn't pan out anyway thanks to the lackluster veg-dog I ended up with. Their beer selection was stellar and their beer cave in back was a fun shopping experience and great place to find a few rarities. They actually had the Rogue Voodoo Doughnut bombers that you can hardly ever find. Unfortunately, my sickness impaired me from imbibing and I actually spent the latter half of the time there barfing in the bathroom (not to the fault of D's) while my friends shopped for a bevy of beer in the cave. Also worth mentioning is how friendly everyone here was. Lots of helpful staff members and even the other ladies in the bathroom who were concerned with my hurling to the point where they wouldn't leave me alone and I had to lie and say that it was no big deal, I was in my first trimester and the morning sickness was getting the best of me. Very nice people those Pittsburgh folk are.CM and I visited D's yesterday (Sat.) at around 7pm for dinner.  Given that CM lives right around the corner, and that I had a City Dining Card, D's had been on our list for awhile, and we were eager to check it out. We happened to arrive right when the Kentucky Derby was in full swing, and there wasn't a table to be had, so we gave our name to the hostess to be texted when a table became available (Note: D's uses NoWait).  Fortunately, we arrived right at the end of the derby, so several tables soon cleared out, and we received the text within 10 min., despite an estimated wait of 15 min.Once we were seated at one of the high tops next to the mural, we perused the menu to decide what to order.  Because I don't eat beef, I decided to go with the turkey dog ($5.50), style of the month for May (topped with pierogies, onions, and sour cream), as well as a veggie dog ($5.50), Angry Tiki style (topped with bacon, pineapple, hoisin sauce, and spicy cheese sauce).  CM decided to go with the bratwurst dog ($6.50), Mason Dixon style (topped with chili and coleslaw) on a wheat bun (+$.50) and a turkey dog, Big Ben style (topped with fries, cheese wiz, and cole slaw).  In addition to the dogs, we ordered a large order of fries, pub style ($8).The fries were brought out first, per our request, so that we could munch on them.  I'm pretty sure they were the largest order of fries I've ever received--they would have solved the Irish potato famine in a jiffy!  They came drenched in cheese wiz and generously sprinkled with real bacon bits (not Bac-Os!), with a sizeable cup of ranch dressing on the side, which we promptly poured on, as well (yeah!).  Despite all the dressings, the fries were pleasantly crispy, due to being of the battered variety.  However, over the course of our meal, they became progressively more soggy, due to the dressings soaking into them.  Between the two of us, we finished about 2/3 of them--not too shabby, esp. for people of our size!As for the dogs, to my surprise, I was more of a fan of the Angry Tiki than the pierogi dog of the month.  When it comes to the dogs themselves, I preferred the turkey dog to the veggie dog, which I found bland.  However, the toppings of the Angry Tiki dog were so flavorful that they masked the blandness of the veggie dog, which was only detectable when I bit into it alone.  Although I thought the turkey dog itself was more flavorful, I wasn't impressed as much by the toppings, which consisted of what were no doubt Mrs. T's pierogies and too many grilled onions for my taste (I removed many of them).  CM preferred the turkey dog to the bratwurst dog, and the Big Ben to the Mason Dixon style slightly, but enjoyed both styles.The service at D's was friendly and efficient--our orders were placed and fulfilled promptly and with a smile.  During the short time that we waited for our food, CM and I enjoyed examining the mural, which contains many real life and fictitious characters, and the monk decorations on the other wall.  Although we didn't order any beer, we checked out the beer cave before leaving, and were quite impressed with the selection--now CM has a neighborhood go-to spot the next time he needs to bring a six pack to a party!  With the City Dining Card, our total came to $23, which I felt was quite reasonable for the amount and quality of food received. In sum, we were very pleased with our experience at D's, and would definitely return, esp. in light of the proximity to CM's residence and the extensive beer selection.

Amazing!  From start to finish this place was incredible.  Great french host (Mgr?).   Great french waiter, helpful and funny.   The support staff was way above average always, plates cleared and drinks filled in a timely manner. I REALLY like the fact they don't rush you and try to flip tables, we were there about two hours. This is a quaint little stand alone restaurant that also has a small bar and a few tables out on the patio.  I'll be back soon just to visit these areas.   We started with a nice bottle of french wine.For the appetizer:Brie en CrouteCreamy Brie coated with toasted almond slivers andwrapped in puff pastry, then baked, served with toastedbaguettes and port reduction The main courses:Poitrine de Porc ProvencalePan roasted pork tenderloin crusted with herbs d'provenceand served with sweet corn and goat cheese polenta fritters,sauteed pea tendrils with grape tomatoes and leek fondueAnd...Coquille Saint-Jacques a la SophiePan seared Sea Scallops served over sauteed ricotta gnocchiwith a citrus and shaved fennel baby arugula saladfinished with tarragon beurre blancFor Desert:Raspberry BruleeChambord soaked fresh raspberryinfused in vanilla creme brulee----- I need to get creative and come up with more birthday's, anniversary's, holidays, or some other random reason to splurge on a place like this more often.Dottsy Z. and I met here last week to try their new happy hour and we had an amazing time! The weather was perfect, the patio beautiful, and the company was amazing.Their happy hour menu featured a nice variety of white and red wines, all for $6, plus we tried the escargot, pate, and frites as well. We spoke to chef, who was very knowledgeable and able to accommodate gluten free items, especially if you call a day or two in advance. We topped off the night with a decadent creme brulee and imported cocoa dusted truffles, which capped off the evening on a perfect note.4.5 starsI had my first date with Jessica F here! It was supposed to be a big group (yeah you FLAKES) but it ended up being just her and I and we were treated like ROYALTY!Let me get some disclosure out of the way: Thomas was our server, and he is also a friend of mine. That being said, he was professional and courteous. He definitely had his "Top Notch Waiter" hat on that night. You probably wouldn't have been able to tell we are friends.We indulged in some of the wine specials for their happy hour. Each glass I had was only $6. We decided to try the escargot (nice and garlicky), the pate (delicious) and the frites (they were frites). The main event of the night for me was the Beef Bourguignon. Omigosh, friends! I dream of this dish to this very moment. The beef was perfectly cooked and the burgundy sauce was FANTASTIC. WHEW! Did it just get warm in here? I was so full and happy after that amazing meal!I will most certainly return to Sophie's in the hopes of giving them the 5 stars I'm sure they deserve!Food poisoning for two, please...I am really confused by all the 4-star and 5-star reviews for this place. The 4-star average Yelp rating was the reason my wife and I chose to dine here during our stay in Phoenix. Yelp, you really let us down this time.So I was on company business travel in Phoenix the week of March 12th and my wife was traveling with me. We had a French impulse that Tuesday night and tried to crash Petite Maison in Scottsdale, only to find out that reservations were required and there were no tables available. The following night, still craving French cuisine, we decided to stop in at Sophie's French Bistro in Phoenix.The first warning sign was that the place was entirely empty during peak dinner hours. However, encouraged by the strong reviews on Yelp, we decided to go ahead and order. We took advantage of a couple of happy hour specials and ordered the following...3 Cheese PlateChef's PateCalamariCrispy Duck BreastCreme BruleeThe food was average at best. My wife and I both tend to critique food as we eat it, and we both found ourselves commenting that the portions were small and the food was overpriced for what it was. Most of what we ate was bland and the pate had a very odd flavor and consistency.The fun started about 4 hours later when we were back in our hotel room. We both started experiencing various internal moaning and groaning, followed by the onset of stomach pain. No big deal, I thought... By shortly after midnight, we were each fighting for time in the bathroom, taking turns to vomit up everything we had eaten that night. I'll try to spare you the details, but this was the kind of violent and uncontrollable vomiting that I have only experienced perhaps once before in my entire life. Needless to say, diarrhea was also involved.After going through this for a good two hours, my wife and I were both thoroughly exhausted and dehydrated. My wife even told me she felt like she was dying, and said that she had never felt this bad before - not even during child birth. o.OSo by around 2:30am, my wife was begging for me to call an ambulance. For a while, neither of us could get up off the floor to reach the telephone. I eventually found a break in the vomiting and managed to sip down enough water to recover slightly. I carried my wife out to the car and asked the hotel receptionist for directions to the nearest hospital.We drove to John C. Lincoln Hospital on Dunlap, which I recommend if you ever get poisoned by Sophie's French Bistro. I managed to get there without hitting anything, which was remarkable since I could barely see straight and could barely function at all. Once inside, my wife completely collapsed and was unconscious briefly. The nurses and doctors rushed her into the ER and brought her back around. They gave her a shot of morphine and then hooked her up to an IV drip of fluids. As I waited, I continued to experience vomiting and tried to keep myself hydrated. Despite being in a hospital, I was determined not to check myself in for treatment, not wanting to add further medical bills.Sometime around 5:00am, my wife was ready to be discharged. The official diagnosis was acute food poisoning. We were never able to identify the specific meal at Sophie's which poisoned us, as we both shared the same courses and ate equal amounts each.However - and this is the kicker - when the doctors asked us where we had eaten dinner and we told them it was Sophie's, they remarked "oh, that place!". We learned that the ER at John C. Lincoln has seen 3 other cases of food poisoning caused by Sophie's. The hospital took our information for the purpose of compiling a complaint against Sophie's with the AZ Department of Health Services. They told us that once they have at least 10 confirmed cases, then they are required by law to report the incident as a disease outbreak.This all would have been nice to know before we chose to dine at this place. I can only assume that the other poisoning victims either don't use the internet, or are still laying in a pool of vomit somewhere, too weak to write a review.Please, please, PLEASE don't put yourself through the same hell that we went through that night. After this experience, we lost all desire to dine in Phoenix ever again. Thanks, Sophie's, for ruining our trip.For the record, we did have an excellent meal at CIBO Pizza the night before we were poisoned. I highly recommend CIBO. Great food, without food poisoning.

Ahhhhhh. The neon green relish. The crisp, fresh pickle and tomato. The poppyseed bun. The real Vienna beef dog... well, it was a bit soft but in general the food here to me says west 35th, 55th off the Dan Ryan, or even 95th and Ewing if you know what I mean. They've got the lingo. Fresh cut fries, pizza puffs. Sadly the decor to me says something more like Fullerton and Clark. It's just a little too nice. I know that's a strange complaint. The tables and chairs look right, but that glass-and-brass sneezeguard and the tasteful mural... eh. Its just not tacky enough. I want to see posters of thick eyebrowed women holding up kronos gyros. I digress. Tasteful decor is not a dealbreaker though. I'm sure I'll be back.

Just in case anyone was wondering... the Italian beef sandwich and hot wings are just as tasty when you take them to go. You know... in case you needed that information. I crisped up the waffle fries in the oven when I got home, and it was like sitting there. But without the friendly faces and awesome tap line up.

Review Text :
Just got in from a great evening at Grinders! Who knew you could hear amazing blues music for free -- in Sunnyslope of all places -- on the 2nd Saturday of each month!? I did, actually. The real question is why don't I go every month!?So, now I'm hopped up on a dirty chai latte and I must share the details about this neighborhood gem. Truly, the Valley's BEST neighborhood coffee shop! For a number of reasons...1.) Grinders is a place where everyone feels welcome from high school kids to retirees taking advantage of the free wi-fi.2.) They roast their OWN beans. That's right. They wheel a roaster out onto the same concrete slab that becomes the stage for Valley blues legends like Ronnie Whitehead on 2nd Saturdays and roast the beans for themselves!! I find their coffees to be pretty earthy and smooth. 3.) The fudgy pecan brownies are rich and chocolaty. The scones are biscuit-like and just the right amount of barely sweet. (I haven't tried the danish, but they look deadly!)4.) They are generous in sharing their own talents and promoting the talents of others, ensuring access to arts and culture. Each month, they allow a different local artist to show their work on the coffee shop walls. And while ordinarily they are not open past 6 p.m. on Saturday, an exception is made on the 2nd Saturday of each month when you can sit outside and listen to  live jazz and/or blues from 8 - 10 p.m.  And, by the way, Dennis, the owner, is a bad ass on the harmonica! We really are so lucky to have such a great business, doing great things, in the community!There are so many great things about Grinders!  Rotating Art from local artists (and not the ones trying their hardest to win the next hipster award), live music with great jazz bands, excellent coffee and tea reasonably priced. The fourth star is awarded for the pecan/cream cheese Danish thing the server recommended. It was so good I couldn't decide weather to scarf it down or savor each bite.

Ew! Ew! Gross! I know that's not the most mature thing to say, but that's what comes to mind when I think about this place! Sad thing is, I've been here a couple times. Every time I kept thinking it would somehow get better, but no, it doesn't! The Miso soup they serve has this weird after taste, and to be honest, doesn't taste like any Miso soup I've EVER had! So on to the sushi, oh yeah, it's gross too! I think I kept going back because the size of the rolls are humongous. The thing is the fish does NOT taste fresh at all! It's always luke warm and....just.not.good. Oh well, I tried. But I'd suggest you not!

So Dallas G and I were thinking of a lunch spot.  I suggested Cibo, Matt's, or Valley Pizza, and he thought of Focaccia Fiorentina.  I thought FF sucked the first time I went there but was willing to give it another try. But when we got there ol' Dally had a "better" idea and suggested Athenian Express.As we pulled in, some unacceptably angry looking woman glared at him for a reason that will presumably remain unknown to us.  (Please enjoy my multimedia Yelp.)http://twitter.com/spirit_fingers/status/5209414090In retrospect, I think she was our guardian angel trying to scare us off.  Inside, the place looks quaintly divey.  I asked if anything was so much better than the gyro that I should get it instead, and was told that the gyro is the way to go.  Feta or no feta?  I wondered if it was an avalanche of feta or just a sprinkling.  He puts a lot on there.  Fine, no feta.  I get the potato salad with it, and an order of spanakopita--which I ordinarily love.We sit outside.  The spanakopita arrives.  It has little cheese and is not flaky.  Tastes kinda like shit.  Served with crappy tzatziki, which I don't think is the appropriate side for spanakopita but whatevs.http://twitter.com/spirit_fingers/status/5209643122Next, my gyro arrives.  The gyro meat is covered in three slabs of tomato and a mountain of onions.http://twitter.com/spirit_fingers/status/5209752658As you can see, at this point I'm fearing the worst.  Look, I like onions and all, but when you leave fresh onions out in the air for too long they become veeeerrrry rowdy.  Like so rowdy that eating one would be enough to burn your mouth and render you a pariah.  So all that's left of my gyro is three slices of "gyro meat" and tomatoes.  And the little side cup of tzatziki that is only filled a third of the way.  The gyro meat tastes like... nothing.  I am underwhelmed.I move on to my side of potato salad.http://twitter.com/spirit_fingers/status/5209805283Normally mustard potato salad has a pastelish yellow hue, but this one looked like it could be seen from space.  Whatever it was, it was odorless and flavorless, so I can only assume it's some undetectable poison like polonium-123.  If I die, I leave my rapier-like wit and boundless charisma to my son, Samir.  You all can fight over the rest.Anyway, the restaurant pretty much blew.http://twitter.com/spirit_fingers/status/5209947387I'm not an arsonist, it was a joke, relax.  But not as big of a joke as Athenian Express, which must have suffered a precipitous decline in quality if even Dallas G (and his notoriously low standards) ever liked it.Every day that Richard Z is in my hood, I play emotional Russian roulette with our lunch spot. Is he gonna hate it? Is he going to order the wrong item and blame me for the rest of the day? Should we go with the tried and true. Should we try a new locally owned small business gem and raise Phoenix out of the fiery ashes of its universal assessment as the smallest of the big cities? The guy's a real Nazi about his sustenance. So today, as we're walking to Focaccia Fiorintina, where we just should have gone to begin with, I'm like, "OH! Do you like gyros? Your last name is Greek. Let's go to Athenian Express!" Well, that was stupid. I really really really hate ripping on mom and pop shops. I hate giving two star reviews to family owned restaurants. But damn... You made me look like a REAL arsehole, Athenian Express. Poor Richard Z has been lamenting about how empty he feels all afternoon. And being the people pleaser that I am, well, I'm just devastated. The lady that took our order, no doubt a solid and very decent human being, was unwilling to play along with any banter whatsoever. For two extroverted numbskulls like us, it just takes a little bit away from the charm.And the spanikopita arrives... I find it too spinachy. He finds it too bready. Just goes to show you can't please everyone, or in this case anyone. My sandwich was literally inedible. Not because of the taste. I picked it up and the whole thing fell right apart. My tray looked like a murder scene. Ketchup, who for so long suffered as the understudy in this WAY off Broadway spectacle, played the part of my disappointment. When I asked @spirit_fingers about his meat, he said, and I quote, "It's not offensive." I remember liking this place in my past life. Today, it was not good.I'm a huge fan of Greek food.  I've been to Athens, and I loved it there.  And believe it or not, I like "express" aka fast casual restaurants where you order at the counter and they bring your food to the table.So, when I found myself downtown and hungry for lunch, heading over to Athenian Express was a no-brainer.  I can't say that I'll be rushing back, but it was fine... it delivered on what I was in the mood for on that day.Lunch pricing is super affordable and portions are large.  The Greek Salad was nothing special - I've definitely had better (but I've had worse too). **One key thing to note: I do not recommend adding chicken to your salad.  It's not the greatest quality chicken.  If you do go here, stick with the vegetarian options.

Review Text :
Located at Sharon Corners (behind Harper's/McD's) is some superfantastic breakfast eats!I had it in my head that OPH was going to be 1. expensive, because Southpark and 2. crazy crowded.  On a weeknight around 7:00, I was wrong on both counts.  Now, don't get it twisted - on the weekends, this place stays at full capacity, but the Tuesday dinner crowd was light, seemingly consisting of mostly regulars.  With a prime corner spot in the shopping center, parking is plentiful but the lot is crammed and the spots are on the narrow side (for those of us killing the planet in our SUV's).  I was warmly greeted when I entered and promptly seated.  My waiter came over immediately to get my drink order, came back a moment later and I was ready to order.  My food came out very quickly, and was smoking hot.My food:2 eggs over well - cooked perfectly.  Eggs were fresh and delicious.4 slices of turkey bacon - it seemed to be Butterball?  It tasted exactly like what I make at home, only it wasn't burned like I always manage to do.  3 pancakes - so good, so very very good.  Fluffy, not crazy sweet - with butter and some ample pours of the warm syrup, I could have eaten my body weight in these pancakes and I find myself craving them.The total for my meal, without tip, was $8 (I had water to drink).  The food was delicious, service was wonderful, the gentleman who seemed to be the boss that evening was very pleasant.  I will definitely return to OPH.

I must admit, I do like the brews.  I also like the white cheddar mash potatoes.  Other than that, meh.  The food is pretty forgettable.  Another "brewery" that sadly fails to be anything special in the food department.  With the restaurants upping the ante on 8th Ave, you may want to kick it up a notch Rock Bottom.  But how would anyone know to?  It's a chain.  Whomp whomp!If your in the market for a beer or two this could be an option. They have a nice seasonal selection and it's all tap which I prefer. I also like that most of the seating is booth. On my visit the service was lack luster. I have no idea where the waitress went for half the meal and her listening skills left much to be desired. I went with a beer sampler. It was nice being able to try everything they have. I of course went with the pumpkin beer. For my main dish I had stuffed peppers which I honestly enjoyed. They had a great flavor. My only issue is the rice that came with it was a bit under cooked. If service was better and my rice was cooked I would have given this place a solid 4 stars but that unfortunately wasn't the case on this particular visit.

Review Text :
Anyone who's been to South Phoenix knows that Mexican restaurants in that area are about as ubiquitous as bad drivers in Phoenix. My husband and I have lived in the area for 9 months or so but have always been a bit intimidated by just how much selection there is. To make matters worse, there aren't many Yelp reviews of places around here, so we keep feeling like any choice we make is uninformed. (Whatever did we do before Yelp?!) One night, we decided to drive down Central and look for the restaurant that was the most crowded with locals. (Naturally, Poncho's was crowded but we have been there before and find it good but not particularly authentic). Las Glorias--a white and blue building with fish painted on it--was packed, so we made a mental note and decided to return. We came back on New Year's Day when it was decidedly less crowded but the food did not disappoint. In fact, it was downright delicious and this place is definitely our new local favorite. As you can see from the pictures, this place is even more themed inside. There is kitschy nautical decor everywhere--my personal favorite is the lighthouse on the wall that lights up. This place could be covered in real barnacles, though, and I wouldn't care. The food was just that good. To start with, the tortilla chips were hot and fresh out of the oven and the salsa was perfect with the perfect consistency and flavor. For our entrees, I got the Camarones Culichi ($12.50), and my husband got the Camarón y Filete Empanizado ($12.50), which is essentially breaded fish and shrimp served with rice, beans and salad. My shrimp were the freshest I've had in Phoenix with a sweet flavor and firm texture and the culichi sauce (a spicy green chili cheese sauce) was creamy but spicy at the same time. Even when I had finished the shrimp, I found myself dipping chips into the sauce. Can't let something that good go to waste! My husband's fish and shrimp were also excellent, with a slightly spicy and crunchy breading. They were even better dipped in one of the provided hot sauces (don't remember the name but it had a brownish color and tasted smoky). Our experience at Las Glorias was so great the first time that we decided to order to go from there recently. It's nice that they have a website with a menu since most local Mexican places do not. That time, we sampled the Camarones a la Diabla (again, great shrimp and kickin' flavor), the Crab Enchiladas w/ green sauce (incredible flavor and not too rich, but we could have gone without the few shell pieces we encountered), and the Ceviche Tostada (super fresh and perfectly spicy and a steal at only $3). You may have a local Mexican spot you love but there's something distinct and really wonderful about a seafood-only Mexican restaurant with eccentric decor and excellent fresh food. Venture on down Central (yes, south of downtown) and try it for yourself!Yelpers! You're letting me down here. Why has no one else reviewed Las Glorias yet? There are so many good reasons to go but I'll list a few:*It's only 10 minutes south of downtown. Yes, it's South Phoenix, but you'll go further for Los Dos Molinos and it's not even that great. *The people are incredibly nice. They don't speak any English so you'll have to order in Spanish, but they're always polite and smiling when I go in to eat or pick up. *The food is damn good. Fresh seafood options include incredible ceviche tostadas, mouthwatering Camarones Culichi, grilled fish in garlic sauce and more. *This place needs the support of more Yelpers to survive. It's weathered the last two years, but I'm always afraid they'll close their doors. And that would be a loss. Come on, give it a shot! If you don't want to eat in, you can order to go. We've done it many times and the food is always great to have in front of the TV with beer.

The Rusty Nail is a neighborhood diner-style restaurant that serves Pittsburgh-centric comfort foods.  Meatloaf, pasta, and hot roast beef all grace the menu.I came here with my dad who ordered a hot roast beef, and I ordered a bowl of spaghetti and meatballs.  Both meals were right around $10 and delicious.  The portions were huge, and the waitstaff was very friendly.I'm guessing it was the owner, but a nice guy came around asking everyone how their food was and making small talk.  Nice touch.

Review Text :
Duck and Decanter is surprisingly uninspired food.  I wouldn't recommend this as a meal for a downtown diner unless your choices are down to this and Quizno's.  My prosciutto sandwich was dreadfully boring, equal to something you'd probably get in a nice, fancypants hospital like the Mayo Clinic.  There, it would be awesome, but here, as a downtown staple is not noteworthy whatsoever.So as often as I go and as much as I enjoy this place I decided to update my review.  This is absolutely my favorite spot downtown for a sandwich.  Sure you can get Subway or Jimmy Johns for cheaper (not by much) but here you get QUALITY.  Their menu selections has something for just about anyone (they now started carrying gluten free bread) , sandwiches, soups, salads and pastries.  They also have a convenient online ordering system so you can place your order and pick up when you are ready.  Their sandwiches are fresh made to order with exactly what you want.  Try one of their signature sandwiches, YUM! Or keep it simple...it's your choice. If you are not that hungry they offer a mini version of most sandwiches (using one slice of bread but super generous fillings)  I personally prefer to keep it simple, generally going for one of the following, ham sandwich on dark rye with everything, egg salad on dark rye (no cheese) with everything or peanut butter (house made) with honey on whole grain. They offer a variety of beverages including beer, wine and fresh brewed iced tea. You can feed your sweet tooth here with a variety of pastries or select candies they offer.  A happy hour is offered in the evenings, sometimes with live music.  The service is quick , friendly and the ingredients fresh.  Crisp leaf lettuce and tomato on your sandwich are not treated as an afterthought here.  They take pride in their quality and presentation.  Skip the big chains across the street and shop this local AZ business.*Thumbs up* This place is has some really good sandwiches, more specifically the Duckling. Ofcourse you will taste the roasted duck in it, but what I'm pointing out here is that the flavor and goodness of this sandwich is truly amazing. It really hits the spot! Oh yeah, the coffee here is great too. Service was okay so it was all fine.I go back and forth about this place. On one hand, there are some really great things. I love building my own sandwich at Duck and Decanter because they have so many great things to spruce up your order. You can add so many extras to your sandwich to make it delicious. Russian mustard, plump juicy avocados, turkey salad with blue cheese, sharp cheddar spread? Yes, please! They also have great fresh brewed iced tea every day in a variety of unusual flavors. I'm an unsweetened iced tea junkie so I love this.On the other hand it takes a really long time to get your food and sometimes it tastes so blah despite putting a crapload of extras and sauces on it. Then it costs like $10 because you had to add all the extras for flavor. Shouldn't flavor come free?I think it should.Two words- Smokey Forest.It must be me or I just never order the right thing, not sure. Everyone I know that has ever mentioned the Duck tells me they like it. Yes I have been several times over the years. But a few days ago I was at our office which is on 7th ave just south of Thomas. I was really hungry and wanted something to eat, this in it self is kind of unusual as I can more than likely wait until the end of the day before I have to eat. Plus the fact I have enough fat on me to last a few months I would not be starving to death any time soon if I missed a meal or three. So I asked Bruce, you remember Bruce he is the guy I am always asking things when down at the office. I wanted something delivered as I wanted to stay in the office to get a contract ready for signing. The only place he could think of was the Duck, but he said he could go and get it much faster. So I said ok and gave him my card and told him to get what he wants and order me I think it is called the Ducky or something like that.  Man he was back much more quickly than I had expected him to be, so they must have been on the ball in making the food. But the food as I always find; just nondescript. NO discernable flavour just a mish mash of textures and blandness. So I can say I like the building, the quickness they have gotten my food out and the patio. I guess the folks are also nice, but do not remember them so they were not not nice. I just do not get the praise this place gets, I find much better food for less elsewhere. But hey it might just be me since I am of the minority on this subject.I must say I can't believe I have not yet written a review on The Duck yet. As literally one of my favorite places in town one would think it would be at the top of my to do list. Maybe it is my secret desire to keep it a secret, as best as I can, so that it does not turn into a zoo everyday and I can't get my yummy sammies. It is also extremely surprising to me that some have gone to lengths of posting a negative review of The Duck. It seems that in those cases they are wanting The Duck to be something it's clearly not; a mainstream-mass production-delivary running-squeeky clean-just-like-every-there kinda place. If that's what you are looking for then I would suggest going to AJ's, they might be a better fit for you.Duck and Decanter has been around for longer than I have been around. They have won award after award for the best sandwich in town. I am surprised Kanye hasn't busted in on a subway commercial and told Jared that he would let him finish, but Duck and Decanter has the best stuff EVER! It has a homey feel, that makes you almost say (as Jeff L. put it) "Am I still in Phoenix?" They have daily soups and special sandwiches. Their cheese is out of this world, the best provolone I have ever had for sure. They slice all their meat in house and very thin, perfect! I would tell you what sammy is my favorite, but that list would go on way too long. Turkey on a croissant, bree with roasted red peppers and prosciutto, garlic chicken salad, BLT.... The Duck is the perfect spot to have lunch out on the patio on a sunny Saturday or Sunday. They have a musician playing music most of the time and sometimes even have cute little farmers markets and art fests. It is perfectly tucked back in the shopping center with Sports Authority shielding you from the hustle and bustle. There is a fun grass area for pets and children to run around on. They also have some great knickknack shopping available to pa-ruse while you wait for your food. They have all kinds of coffee, tea, dishware, cookware, marinades, candy, drinks, wind chimes, magnets, jewelry, specialty gifts, and so on and so on. You can also call ahead and reorder to avoid the sometimes very long line. Have fun!I've never seen a real duck at this Decanter, but I'm pretty sure that if they knew what a great little treat this local business is, they'd be lining up and quaking to be let in. Duck and Decanter is an adorable little local deli, wine bar and gift shop in Phoenix. With a perfect patio to enjoy lunch on a nice day and a gift shop with unique finds to browse through while you wait for your sandwich, it's an enjoyable experience all around. The food here is freshly made and up to gourmet par. They have a selection of cheeses to satisfy any dairy like and the wine is equivalently nice. I like to visit the Duck when I want a quality lunch and need it in a short period of time. My go-to sandwich is the ham and brie with honey mustard. It's a big sandwich too so I always have a left-over afternoon snack. They have a huge selection of drinks and chips -- including baked lays and for the times when my sweet tooth takes over, they have a variety of brownies, cookies and candy as well. I always enjoy browsing through the gift shop and it's a perfect stop if looking for a unique gift that's off the beaten path. Duck also supports local AZ so they have several events throughout the year with local businesses and promote other local happenings around town. The wine bar is intimate and full of spectacular vinos. I always forget about the wine bar and need to remember to visit more often. All in all, Duck and Decanter is a true treat for my taste buds every time I visit. If you're in a hurry, call ahead and place an order to pick up because it can get pretty busy during lunch time. They also deliver!I dig the Duck.  I don't even really know what to call it.  Part store, part bar, part deli, part someone's living room who doesn't make you feel guilty about not helping with the dishes, only catch being you actually have to pay for your wine and cheese (which I'm totally fine with if it means I don't feel guilty for not helping with the dishes).Basically the duck has everything you could possibly need dispersed at different locations around what appears to be a large cabin with a lush green park in front.  You get your items (wine, coffee, sandwiches, whatever) and you mosey around, find a place to sit and enjoy them, just like you would in your own backyard, except your own backyard probably doesn't have as extensive of a wine collection or an award winning cheese department (and if it does, I officially hate you).I like to come here for happy hour (M-F, til 7:00, $2 off house wine and draft beer) or on Sunday afternoons to do a little daydrinking and people watching.  I don't have kids or a dog, but people that do seem to love this place.  Normally I don't prefer my wine with children (probably why I don't have kids), but the Duck's overall mellow environment somehow soothes me to the point that I find myself actually enjoying the presence of the mini-humans. And if I enjoy anywhere enough to actually consider motherhood, it's probably worth at least a dozen or so stars, but Yelp only goes up to five so five it is.Duck & Decanter is my go to spot for supreme sandwiches, so dang tasty!I cannot testify for the entire menu, I have 2 favorites that I keep going between. But I can attest to how delish their coconut macaroons are, they are soft, moist and sweet, perfectly cooked on the outside and soft and tender on the inside. Also they carry Fairytale Brownies, and I know those are bomb! My 2 favorite sandwiches right now are the Vermont Treat & Sonoran Chicken.  The Sonoran Chicken has a spicy oil & vinegar sauce like and has jicama, bell peppers, cilantro, corn and green onions with chicken all mixed together and I always pick to have it on ciabatta bread with Swiss cheese, tomatoes and some lettuce, omg this is such a great sandwich! So good I crave it at times! The Vermont is a maple glazed ham sandwich with pine nuts, spinach, sliced apples and cheddar cheese, omg this is heaven on bread!  The blend of the ham cheese and apples are amazing, beautiful flavors happening their!This location is pretty sweet too, there is seating upstairs as well as downstairs, and on the weekends there is live music out in the patio area. And there is a even a beer & wine garden and a cozy fireplace too!Yep this Duck & Decanter is becoming a favorite of mine. I'm sure I'll be back in no time.

Review Text :
Mac Alpine's is an Original Soda Fountain.  Pretty sure it's the only one left in the city.  When you walk in you can sit on one of the stools at the original bar and one of the lovely folks there will make the drink or ice cream desert of your dream.  A fizz, an egg cream, a malt or even a simple Dr Pepper float.  You name it, they can make it.  The ice cream deserts rock in their simplicity.  There are some very cool original booths still left, and some extra seating in the back.  It's not a huge place by any means, but I've never had to wait for a table - even when they were a stop on the First Friday bus route.  Folks who came by acted like they were in a museum - just looking at all the cool stuff - some of which is for sale - and left.  They have NO idea what they were missing out on here.  The ONLY thing that makes the place not get 5 stars is that they don't offer french fries.  Their burgers are awesome - but without the fries, I stick more to their amazing BLT or their messy but good good egg salad.  Both of those go great with their potato salad - which I think is one of the best ever.  The absolute best part?  We had 2 meals, 2 flavored drinks and 2 deserts and it cost less than $25.  Bam baby.Have you ever watched those dumb/boring/nerdy space documentaries that tell you lies regarding the impossibility of time travel? Some dude with a talking computer tells you "...currently, there is no way to deviate from the space-time continuum"... Lies! I'll tell you how to do it.  You don't even need to buy a time machine on eBay like Kip Dynamite. Just get into your car (no, it doesn't have to be a Delorian) and drive to 7th Ave and Thomas Rd (just south of Thomas on the E side), and BAM! You, my friend have entered another dimension.You walk into this place and you expect to see Cowboy Biff sitting at the bar. Unfortunately, all you see is elderlies shuffling about. Well, they must know something that we all don't. Like an old man/woman secret that they only tell their peers. You, my friend, have just learned their secret! Sit down and order yourself a Black Bean Burger. What? You say you don't like vegetarian food? Well, neither do I! Trust me. Do it!While you wait, you can imagine you are your grandpa at 12 years old. Just stopping into the local soda fountain shop to get a smooth refreshing malt. Being a 12 year old in the 1930s, you notice how modern and sleek the decor is in here. Ice cream adverts everywhere... Makes you want to stay 12 forever."Mom, can I have some ice cream?" Oh, I mean "Sorry, can I get a strawberry malt with that Black Bean Burger? Ahem, thanks..."Who puts celery in chili?No french fries?Carrot and raisin salad on the menu?Cute old-fashioned decor, but really I just wanted to dust the place.This was my third time and probably last . The service was terrible. No particular server assigned so therefore no one to check on us. Our dirty dishes from lunch were still on the table when ice cream soda dessert arrived. I guess management did not anticipate being busy the Sunday during memorial weekend.I love Macalpines it's in my neighborhoodI get the whole vibe .With that being said They need to get a touch realistic they are becoming over priced its Thrifty ice cream Not Ben and Jerry's I'm not complaining But when a Sandwich ice tea and a Ice cream is costing $17.50  then $21.00 withTip I  think it's a little too much ..., just saying

Review Text :
Might I say that this is one of the best places in Pittsburgh to get a late night bite and brew?  Yes, I might and will say this.After a frustratingly long day during a frustratingly long week at work, I decided I needed to stop here and ease my nerves with some comfort food and try out a few brews.  This, my friends, is just what the doctor ordered (no pun intended in relation to my work).My friend had beat me there and already had one of each in front of her.  She decided on the Trailerpark Tatchos and I'm not quite sure what she had to drink, but it was interesting in an interesting glass.  The Tatchos were amazing.  Nothing more than nacho toppings on tater tots, but a brilliant idea none the less.  The mixture of tastes on the fried up tater tots was great.  In a single bite you got spicy, hot and cool.  I decided that I needed to order something else myself, as I feared that my friend might end up raising her lip and snarling at me for eating more than I should.  I got myself an order of Cloudy and a Chance of These.  I dare you to take a wild guess as to what this order pertained to.   DING DING DING...you, sir get a prize...not really.  Nothing but an order of meatballs swimming in a big huge potion of their sauce.  Served with a side of bread to sop up what the fork missed.  The right combination of spices mixed with the melted cheese on top was what did it for me.  And that bread made sure I didn't miss a smear of that sauce.As for the brews, I tasted three different ones while I was here.  It was kind of hard to choose, but their nifty little binder filled with the choices made it easier.  What also made it easier was the fact that our waitress was able to make suggestions, not just guesses like most places.  Different flavors hitting my palate at just the right time made for a great night here.  I will definitely keep this on my short list when I need to calm myself after a hectic day at work.It's time for an update, as promised, since I revisited Harris Grill the weekend before last.  This time, I came with CM and a friend of his for dinner, instead of late night drinks and snacks.  Although we came at prime time (around 7:00pm on a Sat.), unlike my last visit, it wasn't crowded at all, which was probably due to the snowy/cold weather.  This time, instead of being seated at one of the cramped tables next to the staircase, we were seated at a prime corner table upstairs with a great view of Ellsworth Ave.  Between these factors, our visit was off to a good start.After perusing the menu, I decided to go with the pork shank special ($17), and CM ordered the jerk chicken tacos ($12).  Additionally, as promised, I ordered the large mac and cheese again to split, to which we decided to add bacon ($13).  CM's friend went with the turkey burger ($9), which came with fries.  Upon being served, my pork shank entree looked quite impressive, impaled with a knife and surrounded by steamed veggies and some mashed potatoes.  When I tried it, however, it tasted like something from a chain restaurant--meaning that while it wasn't bad, it wasn't particularly special, either.  I didn't try CM's jerk chicken tacos, but he seemed to enjoy them, and I didn't ask his friend what he thought of the turkey burger, so I can't offer an opinion on those items.As for the mac and cheese, this version was better than the version I'd had previously.  This time, it had an acceptable amount of cheese (although it would have been improved by even more...), and the bacon added some savory depth to the flavor.  As before, it came sprinkled with bread crumbs underneath the bacon, which gave it some extra crunch (as mentioned previously, I enjoy bread crumbs on my macaroni).  However, some of the noodles were a bit burnt (see photo)--perhaps this was due to toasting the bacon and bread crumbs on top?  Overall, while this was an improvement over the prior version of this dish I had here, it was only okay to good, failing to crack the top echelon of PGH mac and cheeses (score: 7.0/10).Service was about what I'd expect for a place like this--not super attentive, but there when we needed it.  The check for CM and I came to around $50, which seemed steep for the quality of the food received.  Fortunately, I had a City Dining Card, which knocked off $10, but even so, with tip, we still almost cracked the $50 mark.  Taking everything into account, I'd be willing to return for Happy Hour or Bacon Night, but I doubt I'd return for (regular priced) dinner, since the quality:price ratio was lower than I'd like, and there are many other options in the area. 3.5 stars.I love Mac and cheese.  After seeing the pictures of a variety of mac and cheese options, I knew I needed to test out Harris Grill.I came in with two friends a few days ago.  My friend and I split the "I Can Has Bacon Cheezeburger" and an order of Mac and Cheese.  The total for this was about $12.50 with tax each. The burger was good but not special.  There was more bacon on the burger than most places, but it was not the star of the meal.  The mac and cheese, however, was fantastic.  The portion was quite large, and our awesome waiter brought us some Sriracha, which was a great addition!  There was lots of rich cheese sauce, which was extra yummy on our french fries.  This is one of the top mac and cheeses I have had in Pittsburgh.The place is a bit dark, and even on a Wednesday night, most people were already toasted at 6 PM.  The witty menu is fun to read while waiting for food as well.Parking can be challenging on Ellsworth so be prepared to walk a bit.

Review Text :
I heart (attack) Texaz Grill. My tummy (arteries) were filled with good ole, down home cooking. My NY strip was perfection and dripping with flavor (cholesterol). Rickie's a Texas boy so he knows his chicken fried anythings, and his chicken fried chicken was smothered in love (gravy) and he nibbled every bite (inhaled like there's no tomorrow). I chased my taters, sauteed shrooms and steak down with a cold Dos XX and a Patron shot. All this with attentive and friendly service. The room reminded me of the shack Steve Martin lived in, in the beginning of The Jerk. And for this place, the license plates, posters and bric a brac that cover every corner, including the ceiling above the urinal, yes, guys get this...when you have to pee so badly, you arch your  head back with an eye rolling groan...that's how I saw the posters on the ceiling. But all the kitchy crap everywhere works for Texaz Grill. The menu has all kinds of steaks and wonderful sides. The only thing missing is a defibrillator.First time back in a couple years...This place serves the best Chicken Fried Steak in Phoenix! The staff are friendly, fast, and knowledgeable. Menu is simple and to the point. The memorabilia from Texas and Arizona should be in a museum. The prices are very reasonable! In fact, next time we are going to split one order. The "bigger than the plate" (and the plate was huge) CFS is only $12 and that includes a salad, bread, and fries...Damn, I need to get here more often!So it has been a little over a year since I was here last. The place still holds a 5 star review from me. I tried the CFS and it WAS good. I never really cares for CFS but figured if I was going to like it I should get it from the best. It is a 7inch plus slab of tender beef, lightly battered in a airy type of batter. Think of soda water infused batter. They then slather the middle with a creamy and yummy white gravy. They serve it with mashed and corn with a biscuit on the side. The corn was cold, the mashed were OK and the biscuit was just OK. The price for lunch was $7.99 of something really reasonable. The Chef salad with chicken looked killer.TexAZ Grill is a low key hidden gem in Phoenix.  It's location is modest, its decor is eccentric, very Texan inspired, and the size of the restaurant is fairly small.  The portions however are not so small.  I went for Brunch and of course I had to try the chicken fried steak everyone raves about. I was not disappointed in the CFS, just as the man other yelpers state, it is Indeed very good. Not made of the usual ground beef type of meat, it was more of an actual deep fried thinly pound steak.  What also came as a surprise, was how much I enjoyed the side dishes. The gravy was amazing, as were the biscuits and if your thirsty, may I suggest the Turlingua Sunrise. I cannot wait to come back and try a big juicy steak. God bless Texas!Nope, nope, nope.I came here on the recommendation of other fellow Yelpers and I am so disappointed.Firstly, parking is a mess.  Next, I came with my husband and two year old daughter and the hostess told me that they don't have a high chair that can accommodate a two year old so she had to use a booster seat.  The problem is that she's at that middle age where she's almost done with high chairs and still too immature for a booster seat.  What a mess trying to keep her in her booster seat and contained.  She wasn't noisy or badly behaved, per se, she just wanted to stand up in the booth and look around and fidget with all the condiment bottles on the table.  Also, can I mention that the booths have a weird half wall that obscures the other diners from the chest up, but is open from the chest level down, so someone in the other booth could easily reach underneath the wall and dig around in your purse if they wanted to, or your two year old can peek underneath the booth wall to play peek-a-boo with the diners on the other side?  It's pretty weird.So the waitress came over took our drink orders with a minimum of small talk (or overall friendliness).  We perused the menus.  My husband chose a beef brisket sandwich.  I wanted a t-bone steak, I had been craving one and I was looking forward to it.  We ordered our dinners and it's worth mentioning that at NO point did the waitress acknowledge that presence of our daughter.  She never asked us what she wanted to eat or if she needed anything to drink either, apparently she was invisible.  Seeing as how there weren't any kids meals on the menu, I just assumed we'd feed her from our own plates, but interestingly the waitress just assumed that too because she didn't even ask if she'd be having a side order of something as her meal,  She just looked right past her.  If I sound pissed it's because I was.  I don't need the waitress to pinch her cheeks and make baby talk with her, but to merely acknowledge the fact that there were three human beings sitting at the booth that night would have been covered in 'Basic Manners 101'.So my steak was very flavorful and tender but BADLY undercooked, terribly fatty and a sickly color gray.  (It didn't have a nice sear or a good caramel color to it.)  I ordered it medium rare, but instead I got bloody, almost blue meat.  And there was so much fat that I only got about half meat, the rest was all scrap fat and the bone.  My sides were non-descript.  I think my mashed potatoes were probably decent, I honestly can't even remember that's how non-descript they were.  The roll and bread 'basket' that came with my food (one little roll and one little cold biscuit) were hard and tasted store bought.  And my hungry toddler didn't even want them.  My husband's beef brisket sandwich was a pathetic, dried out, flavorless waste of good money.  We didn't even bother with desserts.I had a margarita; it was very good, but beguilingly strong for how petite the rock glass is that it was served in.  After I finished it the waitress came around and asked me if I wanted another and I declined, but my husband (a non-drinker) immediately piped up and said "Yes, she'll have another!" and shot me a playful look, and rather than looking to me so see if I *really* wanted another $7 margarita or not she simply walked away and had the bartender make me another one!  WTF?  So within a couple of minutes I had yet another very, very strong margarita sitting in front of me.  Now I'm no cheapskate but I don't like to waste money so I choked down that second margarita and it was the proverbial 'straw that broke the camel's back'.  I may have finished it, but it definitely finished ME.  I spent the rest of the night stumbling and mumbling to myself about someone slipping me a mickey.  I've never, ever had a margarita that strong and I am a very well seasoned drinker.   What of Earth did they put in them??So to sum it up I spent over $60 (includes the tip) for 2 small Molotov cocktails disguised as margaritas, an undercooked, fatty, t-bone steak, an inedible, dry beef brisket sandwich and a big serving of NOTHING for my child.  Never again.The two stars are for the flavor and tenderness of the otherwise failure of a steak and the extreme value for your money on the alcohol.  THAT'S IT.Living in New York city for so many years I would chuckle over tourists. Just standing abruptly in utter fascination, usually in the middle of the sidewalk, blocking commutes in Times Square. In the office we would chalk it up to visual overload. So when I walked into TEXAZ Grill and behaved similarly I laughed at myself. Opening the doors to this restaurant was unbelievable. Memorabilia from the Great State of Texas. Covers. Every. Square. Inch.  Neon lights greeted me.  "Texas!" (Also neon shapes of Texas were everywhere.) An old school juke box. Beer signs galore. Guitars hanging. A giant gull head. Horns. John Wayne behind the bar. "Happy Birthday Texas!" The best collection of inappropriate stickers *ever*. License plates of every state covered the bar. The collection has been cultivated over 28 years by the the owner and patrons. (Tip: When you go, feel free to bring stuff in!)Anyhoo, stuff. My eyeballs were full. Finally I made it to the bar and met Tammy. (A hoot who has worked here 18 years!) After inquiring where I was from, a peppy response, "Well, welcome to Texas!" (And so I fell in love with this place. Before food even factored into the equation.)ENTREESSo the food... A tad concerned there wouldn't be a healthy option to consume I was incredibly wrong. (Plenty of non-fried options!) The ribeye steak was to die for. (Perhaps the mashed potatoes with gravy were necessary to consume. But I just had to try them!) The meat was prepared to the exact pinkness level requested. I can't even describe the level of food happiness that transpired that night. The meat was just so tender. I had made the mistake of noshing on the spicy hot peanuts available on the bar, as well as eating my way thru the delightfully prepared coleslaw that accompanied the meal.Amateur hour. Yes, definitely eat the coleslaw. It was flavorful and not too heavy in mayo. (Or try the salad with the blue cheese. Wonderful chunks of cheese.) But leave space for your meal!As I wasn't dining solo I had the opportunity to sample a burger. Holy bejeebers. This isn't a frou frou burger. This is a simply prepared burger, sans grease, on a beautiful bun with high quality meat. DESSERTWe earned a bread pudding! One second and I'll explain how. Tough decision as to what to pick but we went with the french bread in an egg custard with toasted pecans & raisins. Why? It was topped with a bourbon sauce! Dense and delicious. Served as described. Warm. Mmm mmm mmm! Biggest scoop of ice cream too!CLEAN PLATE CLUBClean you plate at lunch and get one punch. Two punches for dinner. EIGHT punches equals ONE dessert! How sweet is that? :)HHMon-Thur 3-6pm1/2 bottled beerWine by the glassAll well drinksAs they say there "It doesn't get any better kids!"We loved sitting at the bar for dinner! Great experience!I've always loved this place. Texas food is always good. I enjoy this place but just can't come here to often. TEXAZ is an unassuming place on the outside and settled in a very tight corner of the shopping center. Like I said very unassuming. Once you walk in then BOOM. It's like a time warp taking you back to Texas in the 1970's. Place is decorated with old pictures related to Texas, road signs, animal heads, caps, and old license places. Very interesting and very loud. Everyone talking, eating, and having a good time. We started out with our usual fries okra. This is the only place I can find fried okra in AZ. Nice change of pace. Love the okra. Nice and crisp. Love it. So I ordered their famous Chicken Fried Steak. They say it's the best in AZ and I can't disagree. All meals comes with a side salad. Salad doesn't look that appetizing but it's not bad. House dressing is pretty good. Anyways, the CFS comes with two huge pieces hanging off the plate smothered with gravy and comes with mash potatoes. Very crispy and fresh. Not greasy at all. Really good. Best in AZ hands down. Only problem is that it's too much food. I couldn't even come close to to finishing it. I saw two guys at a table across from us share an order of CFS. Very smart and would probably recommend sharing this huge meal. My wife ordered the Fried Catfish. Two large pieces of fish with a side of mash potatoes. Wife loved it. Not greasy at all. Fresh and moist but again a lot of food. So good. Everyone's ordering the CFS and fried catfish. There's a reason. My son ordered the prime rib regular cut. Really big piece of meat with a side of mash potatoes. My son really liked the prime rib. He's a fussy eater and he really like the prime rib. So when he likes it then I know it's really good. Looked juicy and fresh. We were stuffed with all this food. Packed up our leftovers but you can't leave this place without dessert. We shared the pecan pie. Oh my gosh. Your probably laughing right now but this is the best pecan pie. Had pecan pie from Texas and all over and this is the best I've had. It had a hard topping that most pecan pies don't have. A little chewy and not as sweet as most pecan pie. Crust is outstanding. Hands down yummy. So the food was really really good. The service was also outstanding. Once we sat down our server was there for our drink orders. Food was brought to our table really fast and they cleaned off our dirty dishes very quickly. We also had our server and owner check on us to make sure everything is okay. Everyone makes you feel at home just like in Texas. So good food (aka little too much), good service, and good dessert. Enjoy and bring a wheel barrow to roll you out. It's that good.

Restaurant name  Jerusalem Middle Eastern Cuisine

Review Text :
The complaints I've heard about this restaurant are numerous, ranging from bad food to the infamous Soup-Nazi-like owner.  So why did I give it so many stars?  Many people would hesitate before eating at Jerusalem Restaurant, and I can't blame them if they have been spoiled by American restaurant standards.  In defense of these kinds of restaurants everywhere, I would argue that you have to be at least a little adventurous (and patient) when it comes to eating ethnic food.  I've become a regular customer because Jerusalem Restaurant is just so STRANGE, and kind of endearing in its own way.  I know that there are limitations to excusing poor service/attitude because of cultural differences, but I have never thought of the owner as malicious or incompetent.  Every visit, one of my friends makes an attempt to get the owner to smile (I've witnessed it, and it is a truly uplifting sight).Below, I've documented some of my observations while eating there.  I know that these are probably factors that cast the restaurant in a bad light, but personally, these are the type of experiences that have made me come to enjoy (at least for humor value) my visits to Jerusalem Restaurant.  Read on:* I first came into Jerusalem Restaurant with friends, and we all decided to order the daily combination plate.  When we got to the counter and placed our orders, the owner just asked each of us, "Meat or vegetable?"  We all requested meat, assuming that we would just receive whatever he was making for the daily meat dish.  To our confusion, when we received the meals, we each had been given a different meat: lamb, fish, and chicken!  (We learned later that you can just request a specific meat.)* I have struggled to decipher the numbering logic used at this restaurant; this is the first example.  When you look at the front counter, there are sheets of paper that show a condensed menu, just the most popular items served at lunch.  Instead of writing Combo #1, Combo #2, etc., their items are listed as #576, #708, etc. (not even in sequential order!).  * This is the second example involving weird numbers.  After you order, the owner will write a number on a piece of scrap paper and hand it to you.  This number is separate from the receipt, so it does not correspond to the price of your meal.  My friend and I thought it over, and we interpreted this as the same system employed at fast food restaurants, where your number is called when your order is ready.  When we looked, my number was 16 and my friend's was 28 (again, not sequential, even when he had ordered right after me).  Then, when our food was finished, the owner just waved at us instead of calling our numbers.  ...Huh?* Unlike most restaurants, the owner doesn't leave unlimited boxes of napkins at the silverware station or your table.  Instead, he leaves just a few napkins (less than 10) at the front counter, so you always feel bad about taking more than necessary.  Great economic/environmental tactic...?I'll briefly summarize a few more important points if you decide to try Jerusalem Restaurant:  (1) Order the spiced hot tea in the winter, (2) the restaurant is only open for lunch, not dinner, and (3) no matter how much you're initially intimidated by the owner, he is actually a warm person once you become familiar with him.

Restaurant name  La Gondola Pizzeria & Restaurant
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
I stopped by La Gondola for a quick dinner about two weeks ago before seeing a show in the Cultural District.  I was curious as to how it would compare to the other nearby slice shop, Cafe Milano, which left me underwhelmed.  Ultimately, my assessment of La Gondola ended up being similar, but at least the owner was friendly and didn't aggressively upsell me.To get an idea of what their pizza is like, I ordered two slices--one of the thick crust Sicilian, and one of the thin crust regular ($2.50 each, I believe).  Additionally, I ordered a small side salad ($3.50).  The salad, while not anything too special, was enjoyable, esp. given the price--I especially enjoyed the generous topping of pizza cheese.  As for the slices, I could tell they were made fresh, based on the amount of time that they took to come out and seeing the owner ladling sauce on them before they went into the oven.  I have to agree with Chip's assessment here--they struck me as fairly average in quality.  While there was nothing wrong with them, per se, they just weren't very memorable.  I can't speak for the toppings, since both of my slices were plain (the thought of ordering a topping occurred to me too late), but a good pizza stands on its own.  While I guess $2.50 is relatively inexpensive downtown (esp. in Market Square, where the rent must be sky high), it's more than I'm used to paying for slices.On a positive note, the owner was very friendly, as I mentioned--there's always something to be said for service with a smile.  On the flip side, however, the furniture is looking pretty run down, with large visible tears in the upholstery, and could definitely use an overhaul.  Overall, not bad, but also probably not good enough to make me seek it out again, given the competitive downtown dining scene.  3.5 stars.

Review Text :
So me and my buddy (coworker who is hourly) decide to go to lunch today.  What's the catch?  We don't know where to go.  We decided to go somewhere we haven't tried before that was off the beaten path. Enter Harvey's. Er, well, actually we did the entering.We get into the place and it is a narrow bar with a line of tables to the right. We sit. We wait.  Finally, after much gab, the Waitress/Bartender comes up to our tables and says 'Hi' then proceeds to stare at us.  Anticipating the usual question 'Can I start you guys off with something to drink'  I order an RC cola and my buddy does the same.  She recommends the Cheeseburger so thats what we get.  I also ordered a mixed basket because (FOR SOME STRANGE REASON) fries aren't included with the burger! THIS IS AMERICA PEOPLE!!!!!Along with the burger and fries, we got a lot of time to chat.  and I mean a LOT.  They sure are generous with time!!! Eventually, I ask her to put it in To Go containers and they give us the fries and cokes free.Also, just a side note.  Please eat your food before coming on to Yelp and reading reviews about the food you are eating.  Some of these reviews almost made me vomit... almost.I am a dive bar expert.  I love me a good dive bar.  The darker and older the better.  The surly regulars on the fringes of society are my people.This place is shit.  Not 'The Shit'.  Actual shit, as in a piece of crap.We ordered wings, after the bartender bragged how they were the best in town, and the regulars started laughing about how they just cooked a bunch of fish they caught locally in the frier, and that our wings were gonna taste fishy.  Not in a "we're fuckin' with you" way, but more of a "we have no sense of self" way.Homo say what!?!?They did taste fishy!  We each ate only one.  Everyone was having a great time about it.  We left an entire plate of uneaten wings, and nobody gave a shit.  Fine, no problem.  We finished our beers and left.Even if the wings weren't trouty, they were way too big.  Bigger isn't better in the case of wings.  They aren't actually buffalo wings, and shouldnt resemble some bloated and abused fictional beast.  They should be from chickens.  SMALL CREATURES CALLED CHICKENS.The end.I finally got around to coming here last night, and I really like it!  I knew what I was getting into because A) I've been to the original wineburger at 19th ave and Bethany Home already, B) I've read the reviews and C) I knew that these two places were originally started by a pair of brothers many years ago.Walking in, its a real divey type place.  Wood paneling on the walls, simple no frill tables and chairs, with limited decorations and dimly lit.  It's set up exactly like its sister location the original wineburger, with half of it being a bar with chairs and tables, and the other half being a pool and congregating area for those that want to do more then sit and hang on the bar.  I also saw a pinball machine, which was pretty cool as well.They have a few TV's hanging from the walls behind the bar with a variety of sporting events on for you to watch. Granted, I'm not a huge sports fan, but it's better then staring off into space or what not.  I sat at the bar, since I felt more comfortable there, and there wasn't to many people in here, so there was more then enough seating for me. I felt really comfortable here, and didn't feel like being around a million people anyways.They have great beer and alcohol specials during happy hour, and they have a decent menu of items to choose from. Prices are great, and the bartender here was really super cool.  Him and I chatted throughout my meal and I really enjoyed the conversation.  I went with the Jumbo Hot dog, and it was tasty...charbroiled and all, I really liked it here.If you want a low key night out, go check this place out. Divey, dark and not half bad. Will be back in the future. I think I like it here better then I did at the original one.It's a dive bar where they make "wineburgers" on a flat top behind the bar. It smells of cleaning products, stale beer and grease. It's nothing you don't expect and everything you would.

Restaurant name  Spinato's Pizzeria
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
I like pizza, but it's always been hard to distinguish why I would choose one pizza over another. This pizza had good cheese...that pizza had good pizza crust....but what makes a pizza memorable? I still don't know the answer, but one example of a pizza that stands out is Spinato's. I discovered Spinato's cheesy goodness years ago. My sister asked me to pick up a pizza from this place called Spinato's on the way to her house, but actually...it wasn't even technically on the way to her house. Having never heard of Spinato's, I figured it was just going to be another average joe pizza experience. Then she told me what she ordered: sausage and pepperoni. Sausage? Really? But she swore by it which was random for her to swear by sausage so I went with it, thinking either she's gone off the rocker or this pizza might be something different. I had to smell the pizza for a 10 minute drive on the way to her house. It took everything in me not to pull over on the side of the road and gobble a slice then and there, but for me it's almost as much about the experience eating the food as the food itself, so I wanted to cherish the moment. So to make a long story short, I got home, took one bite of the pizza, tasted this sweet and salty sausage on fresh dough with the cheesy of all cheeses and I knew why my sister made me drive out of my way to pick it up. Now, I live by about 10 pizza places, but I would actually drive the 20 minutes to Spinato's for this pizza. It's hard to explain, but it's something about the combination of ingredients and the authentic pizza parlor feel when you bite into a slice. It's just one of those pizzas you have to try in your life. So, if you are ever in the area or up for a drive, my suggestion is giving Spinato's a try. For pizza in Arizona, it ain't bad!I rarely visit a restaurant where the service stands out to the point that it deserves an update to the five star review I already gave it. While visiting Spinatos recently, I couldn't help but notice how very friendly the restaurant staff. Immediately upon entering, we were greeted by a very friendly hostess who showed us to our seats and grabbed us water right away. Then, the second the the hostess left, the waitress appeared and enthusiastically greeted us. The friendly service continued until the moment we left and it left a lasting impression on me. Staff is normally friendly, but the Spinatos staff definitely woke up on the right side of the bed and you can tell that they truly love where they work! Great pizza and great staff! A + Spinatos!I HATE when I have a preconceived review of a 5 star rating and I get disappointed. I just wish I tried this one for lunch not a full dinner. Spinatos disappointed me big time. The waitress was a ditz, seemed like she was busy thinking about drinking as soon as she got off work. The pizza was OK... they did not ask what crust we preferred and we got the thin. (not my favorite) The toppings were very sparse and not that fresh. (we got the 6 toppings on kinda like a "everything" The sauce was so sweet I thought it was a frozen kid pizza. The salad, while large, was brown wilted, bagged lettuce. The tomatoes were dry and colorless. We asked for garlic ranch and she gave us Italian. They do not have Blue Cheese dressing either The ravioli was boring, the bread stick was hard and dried out. She came by asked what type of gelato the kids wanted, came back 5 min later and had totally forgot she asked asked already. I was not impressed at all by the entire meal.I have been the biggest Spinato's fan since the once small pizza parlor had one location in the valley. It has been exciting to see them grow. I guess what I like the most is the service is always the same no matter which lcoation you dine at. Even the food it consistanct. I recently dined with my family this past Mother's Day. The whole crew my family, friends and I came in to dine at one big table. We ordered a variety of all the fixings so we can all have the pleasure to sampele each other's favorite entree. The portion size of our pizza, garlic toast, cheese toast and salads were reasonable. I tried something different this time. I went with the Gluten Free Pizza. Boy was it yumm!. I did not feel like I was missing out on anything. Matter fact it was so good not one person at the table had an opportunity to sample mine. It was gone in no time. Everything is made fresh at Spinato's. They have some of the tastiest freshhome made sauces. Be sure to check out the website. You can order food to go.This is legit pizza, and I am a real tough critic when it comes to pizza. We ordered two pizzas: Italian beef pizza and a sausage/mushroom/ black olive pizza. Their sauce is sweet, but not too sweet. Their Italian beef with giardiniera pizza is the best version I have had. It's clear that the Italian beef is made in-house.  The sweet sauce balances the spice in the giardiniera perfectly.  Thier sausage was good, but not the best I have had. I like fennel sausage with a little more flavor. Overall, the pizza was great. I will be going back to try an Italian beef sandwich.

Review Text :
I think that Myles and Kristin already said a lot of what you need to know about this sketchy-looking but oh-so-handy-to-have-nearby Chinese place, so I'll just hammer out the highlights:-Closed Mondays -Delivery area goes from 34th Street (E) to 35th Ave (W) and 1-17 (N) to Dobbins (S). Do note, though, that we live off of 19th Ave south of Dobbins (about 1 mile south of the southernmost boundary of the delivery zone) and they said that they would deliver to us without a problem, so definitely still try if you're just outside of the zone. -There is a $12 pre-tax minimum for delivery -Food is decent quality for the price and not as greasy as one would expect-Paper menus have some decent coupons on them. Best one gives you 10 free crab puffs or 3 free egg rolls with purchase of $15 or more-Lunch specials are ridiculously cheap (from $3.50 - $4.50 for entree and rice; $4.15 to $4.88 for entree, rice, egg roll, and crab puff) and are served until 3:30 pmDefinitely not worth driving to if you don't live in South Phoenix. However, if you do live in South Phoenix, this is a cheap and reliable Chinese dine-in, pick-up, and delivery place.

This place is so accidental hipster, and defies categorization. Is it a diner? A bakery? An auntie's living room? Let's just say if a donut shop and a small restaurant played Tetris, this would be the result. The eating area is quiet - no music, just the drink cooler humming - and the experience eclectic - mismatched formica tables, plastic cups for water, and tea cups with feet for the Turkish coffee. The Turkish coffee was weaker than expected, but wonderfully aromatized with cardamom. There was so much food my eyes pin-balled for a minute. The red lentil soup made with sprouted lentils came in a bowl - a real bowl, not a cup-sized bowl. We also had the gyro plate which was satisfying, and mousaka entree which was like an eggplant, potato, and tomato casserole over yellow rice. By itself, the mousaka would last me two additional meals. We couldn't resist the Boston creme donut, which turned out to be the best I've had in Madison, and a gigantic cinnamon roll fritter. Plus the two coffees, the total came out to be $25 (!!) and some change. The service is a relaxed pace, but the owners were charming and seemed to enjoy us enjoying their food. My five-star ratings often depend on how likely and how often I would return, and this place definitely makes the twice-a-month cut.

Went to lunch with coworkers on a Thursday, it was a last lunch outing for one of our coworkers who is leaving the company and one of my coworkers  suggested we get Chinese food, now still being new to our area we didn't know where to go, so whipped out the Yelp App and searched for Chinese food near here and found Panda Garden, so the place was set and off we went.We were a party of 5 and we didn't have to wait got seated pretty quickly for being high noon, sat at our tables and looked the menu, I was impressed with the selection they have for their daily lunch specials, and if those didn't interest you, they have a great looking lunch menu too. And the daily lunch specials even run on sat too, thought that was a nice touch as well.I wish I caught our servers name, I believe she might have been the hostess as well, she was very friendly and very nice, we all told her it was our 1st time there she asked us were we work and just had conversations with us, felt like a nice family place.I ordered the Gang Pang Chicken lunch combo with Lo Mein Noodles, I wanted to try something I never had before & something that was spicy, and this dish looked like the winner for me. The chicken was lighted battered and covered in this great tasting sauce and it had sliced green onions & fresh jalapenos, and with the lo mien noodles, that dish was delish!!  I just need to remember to ask for more heat next time, but that's because I love things spicy hot!Happy to found Panda Garden and looking forward to adding them to my fast lunch time eats!

Review Text :
Pittsburgh is a funny city. There are fantastic high end restaurants (e.g. Tamari, Spoon, 9 on 9, 11, etc...), but not so many medium-to-low-end restaurants. Well, La Feria is the clear exception. For $15 (or less) you can have an amazing Peruvian meal. My wife and I are experimenting with vegetarianism (I know, we're missing out on a lot of yummy meals!), and La Feria is particularly great for us. They always have 2 veggie specials that are great. Last night I had this bean and pumpkin dish which was fantastic.The atmosphere is pretty laid back and the staff are friendly, so for a quick and tasty dinner, this is the place to go.

Restaurant name  That's A Wrap

Review Text :
Fresh. Convenient. Cheap. And I'm not talking about me as a date. It's That's A Wrap! Or It's A Wrap. Or Wraps N Things. Not sure, but me likey! I've only had one thing and it was the turkey wrap with cream cheese and strawberry preserves in a whole wheat tortilla. Dee lish! Side pasta dish was, well, your basic cold side pasta dish. The day we were there, the room was luke warm at best. No A/C! Almost made me want to run for the hills. But we got it to go and enjoyed it at home. Besides the customers who were there were stinky teenagers with pants hanging at their knees, bad posture and sad, sulky little faces. Oh, puberty!Dear That's A Wrap,I've only met you once, but it was love at first sight... I found you easily - on 7th street just north of McDowell and lots of parking in your private lot made me happy. I walked in and felt comfortable immediately - very casual, laid back atmosphere and welcoming staff. Since my lunch companion was a little late, I had time to observe the place, the menu, and even read a New Times that was out for your patrons. A few things I noticed during my wait:1 - you are incredibly fast and efficient!2 - you have smoothies on the back of the menu and they look delicious!3 - you don't mind when people special order4 - I didn't hear any whining or complaining at all while I was thereThe list could go on, but my friend arrived and we ordered.  I had the 'Veggie Jackson' wrap - no onions or rice, add tofu with a side of fresh fruit. My friend had the 'Very Brady Clubster' with a side of fruit as well. We both commented how delicious our wraps were and the fruit was good too! The veggies in my sandwich were grilled to perfection and the combination of flavors from the feta and balsamic salsa blended just right.  I felt like each bite was a party in my mouth.  Sounds cheesy, but I swear, it's true!  Serving size was perfect and so was the price!  (Everything on the menu is $6.95 or less and even if you add chicken or tofu, it's less than $1).It's going to be kind of a hike for me since I'm moving further north, but I will be back for sure...See you soon, my new love!:)GabiThis is the kind of faux genius I am:  I went to the wrap place and got a bowl.  Truth be told though, it was the right move, at least for me.  On a day when I was newly in town and running on fumes, That's a Wrap saved my bacon with some BBQ. Unsurprisingly, I have a soft spot for BBQ, and the bowl available here shows up tasty, packed thorough with veggies and rice, and warm chicken doused in BBQ.  If you're going, get there early as the place was jam-packed when we hit around lunchtime, but even so, service was quick and we were able to procure a table without too much waiting.  Next time I'm in the neighborhood, I definitely wouldn't mind stopping back in.I took advantage of That's A Wrap for their catering services yesterday and once again, was totally impressed!  I called around 10am for a 5pm delivery... I wanted to make sure that those of us who were working at the Phoenix Art Museum all day preparing for the pARTy had some fuel to get us through the evening.  Sure enough, That's A Wrap delivered - literally and figuratively.  I ordered a platter of assorted sandwiches, fruit, chips, cookies, and bottled water - it was perfect!  Everything was delicious!  It arrived right on time and it was all labeled so it was easy to figure out what you were eating.  I had the "Godfather" wrap (Salami, ham, and provolone wrapped in a honey wheat tortilla with lettuce, tomato, red onion, sun- dried tomato mayo and a drizzle of olive oil).  I don't usually choose salami and ham but for whatever reason, this is the one that sounded best to me yesterday - and it was!Thanks That's A Wrap for fueling me and all of the yelper helpers for the pARTy... I'll be back to visit soon!Delicious!B introduced me to this place because he eats here at least twice a week, and my god, I now understand why. They have the most delicious wraps I have ever tasted in my entire life!Fresh delicious ingredients that are actually healthy for you.. and I love nothing more than healthy food that doesn't taste healthy at all.. for instance, the teriyaki 90210.. Grilled teriyaki chicken, crunchy veggies, fresh ginger slaw & jasmine rice.. amazing! Rocky VII, who doesn't love cheese-steak?? Not the healthiest choice they have to offer, but goddamn delicious. Ive also tried the Gringo Star which is the mexicany wrap and The Godfather with salami, ham and my favorite, provolone. I usually get the pasta salad to accompany my lunch, which is also, very yummy. Ive literally never tried anything here my mouth didn't instantly fall in love with. Really, the only thing that sucks about this place is the parking lot.. its tiny! You're lucky if  you can even find a spot during the lunch rush, and if you do, you're lucky if you can get your vehicle out of there once you've parked. People create their own spots at this joint, sometimes behind your car.. but really, park across the street and walk if you have to, it is absolutely worth it!

Restaurant name  The Wrigley Mansion Club
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
Is it an historic mansion, high above Phoenix, with a famous history of who's who? Indeed. Was it a fun venue for a concert by CeCe Peniston? Absolutely. Did I enjoy the limo, wine in the dressing room and VIP treatment from their staff? You bet your sweet ass I did. But the smell. Seriously. Like my geriatric Aunt Helen's closet. Or the community room at a convalescent home. Or Bea Arthur's hair. Here I thought it would smell like Juicy Fruit.Sweet.  I went to the bar, Geordie's, for my first visit to the Mansion.  Had a few glasses of wine and then started to wander.  What a neat place to get away from it all and relax.  The bar menu is pretty limited so keep that in mind, oh and I hear that this place closes for special events so always call ahead. And the view is not too bad either.I have now attended a few events at Wrigley, or "The Mansion" as I like to call it. "What are you doing tonight?""Oh I am attending a little soiree at 'The Mansion." I want to live here,,,and be Batman...maybe Iron Man, I haven't decided for sure. Go here. Be Tony Stark, or Bruce Wayne for the night.There is something indescribably awesome about donning the pocket square and having drinks and socializing in a friggin masion.The drinks tend to be pricey but if they weren't I don't know if I would feel nearly as cool being here. When I live here I will throw crazy UYEs so you should all be prepared to dress the nines and party all night.I love the Wrigley Mansion! I was there a few years ago for a wine maker's dinner and it was beyond memorable: the food, the wine, the views.And, just last night about 12 of us gathered to celebrate a birthday. The staff were very accommodating and offered us the loft above Geordie's for a semiprivate feel. We didn't have any "minimums" or "room rentals." Our server did a great job and got quite the work out going up and down the stairs with our drinks and food! Happy hour runs until 7 and features $5 specialty martinis, which are full size and strength! There's even a tequilla-tini that tastes like a margarita and looks like a Mexican flag!The executive chef came up to welcome and thank our group, which was such a hospitable gesture! I told him how I enjoyed the truffle fries and the burger (see Andrew K's review - BTW, I'm the one who screwed it up by saying "not too much pink") and he explained how they pride themselves on knowing where all their food comes from. They even dry those apples themselves - in-house!It's true that the place was NOT crowded, which works for me because it means I don't have to fight with anyone for a seat to watch some of the country's best sunsets over a cocktail! I really need to come here more often! I will definitely be back!!This was the first time I'd been to Wrigley Mansion while it was open.  I had a "private tour" by an employee once and got to see everything and it really is a great place.Went for a birthday party and we had dinner.  $5 for valet parking, which is really reasonable, I think.  Especially in heels, cuz this girl ain't walkin' up them thar stairs.  We had a private dining room, about 25 or so of us.  Wait staff did an awesome job dealing with such a huge party and handling our bill.If it weren't for the food and price, I would have given this place 5 stars.  I started with the leek tart, which was amazing and a great portion size for an appetizer.Next, had the Tuna Nicoise salad.  This is where they lose a star, and it wasn't just me voicing a problem with the size of the portion.  There was definitely plenty of tuna on it, but as Erin said "You'd think they would have put more of the cheap stuff on it" meaning there wasn't a whole lot of salad.  And the roasted potatoes that came with it?  I had two cubes of HARD potatoes.  They were barely cooked.  The tuna was perfectly seared on the outside and still nicely red on the inside.  If it weren't for that, I would have been horribly disappointed.  $43 for an appetizer, a salad and a bottle of Pellegrino.  (That included the gratuity added for such a large group).  Wrigley is all about the ambiance and view, and it surpasses what you could describe it to be.  Seeing the city at night and being surrounded by cool peeps is what really made the place!The Wrigley Mansion is one of a few historical venues in a city that does not value its past and history. That said, you would think that fact would guarantee a top quality meal and fine dining experience at Geordie's Restaurant. Regrettably, Geordie's turned out to be no better than any other overly-hyped but underwhelming restaurant one would find at a 4- or 5-star resort.I have lived in the Valley for nearly 10 years, and last night was the first time I had ever visited the Wrigley Mansion. I always felt somewhat guilty for never have visited, but I can say with near 100% certainty that my first visit is also my last. The service and wait staff performed well, but the food was the equivalent of one might get at Applebee's, and certainly not worth what I paid.I started off with the carpaccio, which was probably the most disappointing part of the meal. I have had some mediocre carpaccio before, but never this poorly prepared. I suspect a bad cut of beef. I also ordered a side of their white truffle fries that arrived with excessive garlic. The fries themselves were overcooked and tasted like Jack In The Box fries. Generous amounts of catsup were required to make them somewhat edible. For the entrée I tried the server-recommended lamb chop, which I requested to be prepared medium. When it arrived, it was clearly not medium. The meat was tough and lacked any flavor, and the au jus was entirely too salty.The beverage service was quite prompt, however I think the bartender should go back to mixology school. The Manhattan I ordered had too much vermouth and hardly any bitters, while the lemon drop was neither sweet or bitter.The purpose of the evening was to celebrate a friends birthday, so our dinner party had a whole room to ourselves. Given the size of the party, the wait staff did do an excellent job of making sure we were well served. Our glasses were never empty and the food did arrive promptly. Unfortunately, that alone could not make up for the poor food quality and exorbitant price.The food was pretty disappointing for the price, and the drinks menu left much to be desired.  The music was ok, and the service was very close to on-point for the size of the party.  The space is tremendous; as many have said, it's one of the very few places like it in Phoenix with real history.  I just wish they would bring the kitchen and bar up to the same level as the location.I was really excited to visit the Wrigley for my friends birthday. I have been meaning to try this place for years and the Yelp hype has been pretty strong. I was immediately impressed by the staff, we had a very big group and they were attentive and got our drinks and orders in right away. The view of the city was breathtaking and I would come back for happy hour, but just to watch the sunset and a have a cocktail.  That being said... Geordie's restaurant had horrible food. Honestly, one star at best. I had the Cesar salad which was fishy with stale croutons. I also tried the beet and goat cheese salad and I kept looking around for the goat cheese, I had one small dollop hiding under a bib of lettuce. The carpaccio was the worst I have ever tasted. I think the cut may have been bad and I couldn't take more than two bites. I also ordered a side of their white truffle fries; they were the only part of my meal that was anything more than mediocre. For my main I had the tenderloin and it was tough and chewy, the potatoes that came on the side were a joke.  I've been told that Wrigley has the "pay what you will" for lunch. If they applied this to the dinner they served I would left with a much heavier wallet. All in all the over hyped experience left me quite under whelmed. Sure it is a great place to impress your out of town guests with, for the view and history alone. Just take them somewhere else for dinner (like Dick's or Café Barrio) if you want an impressive meal.I am pissed!  I have been attending the Wrigley Mansion for music on the patio for over a year now, and have been raving to all of my friends about it.  All the stars happened to align this last Sunday, and ten (10) of my friends attended with me.I was embarrassed because it was no longer the same Wrigley.In two weeks (since I was there last), all the rules changed.  The cool band, Delcoa, is no longer the band.  There is no longer a $7 buffet.  There remains half price bottles of wine, but they increased the price of the bottles.  Um, excuse me, but if I am going to a casual event on an outdoor patio, why the hell would I buy a $90 bottle of wine (discounted to $45...ooh, what a bargain)!!!?  I swear, even the outdoor lighting has been removed!!!And they have no Facebook presence where I might have been notified...nothing different on the website to indicate a "rebranding."They did still have a good crowd.  I think the crowd follows the band, so all of these people were new to me.  But they were not prepared.  The service was very poor.  (Remember, I was seated at a table of 10...Hello!!!?  Cha Ching!!!?)It's likely I won't be back.My wife and I went here Friday night.  Our plan was to sit in the lounge, enjoy a few cocktails and have some appetizers and a burger.  This plan was thwarted when the bar tender looked at me like I was insane when I asked about their burger.  He told us they haven't had a burger in years.  The bar menu on their website clearly states that they have a burger which was perfect because my wife and I weren't in the mood for the fancy fare of their main dining room.We sat at a table on their patio.  The weather was perfect and the view was even better.  We ordered our first round of drinks and yes they do jack you on the price but that was to be expected.  We then ordered some food to share.* Flat bread pizza thing - excellent* Beet salad - pretty good and pretty unique.  I can't explain it but it is worth a try.* Oysters - not so good.  I have no idea why we got this but for some reason my wife wanted it so go figure.* Truffled mac n' cheese - OMG - Best.  Thing.  Ever.The mansion itself is beautiful but could use a bit of updating especially on the inside.  I do regret, however, not exploring the mansion as much as I should have.  We pretty much stuck to one small wing of the place but there was probably so much more to it than we saw.Oh...and their parking situation is a complete clusterfuk.  The signage telling you where to park, where the valet is, and how to get to the mansion entrance is a complete joke and almost non-existent.  Would it kill them to have more/bigger signs and maybe some lights so you can see them?** Pro Tip = get the $50 Local Dines gift cert for $25 ( http://bit.ly/dfR4eQ ).  Of course they will complain and try to tell you all the rules that somehow aren't listed anywhere.  They will even try to tell you what "dinner" food is and what is not.  Just tell them that if you want oysters and vodka for dinner then that is your choice.  If they want you to get a $65 steak in the main dining room they should clearly say that on the offer.I was excited to try this place and when I saw the travelzoo deal I jumped on it. I was trying to think of the best way to describe their food and it reminded me of convention center food.  I think they have catered to too many weddings and have lost the art of cooking quality meals.This is also one of those places where you get the feeling that its cool to pay more for less. We were seated inside after requesting a patio seat and we brought the average age down about 30 years. It was hot and stuffy and the seats were so uncomfortable I had to take some advil when I got home. Had the worst french onion soup I've ever seen/ eaten (not sure how you mess that up?) and the salmon was too salty even for me.  I'm would not consider myself a food snob but I have eaten plenty of good food and this place just doesn't make the cut.  The only plus side to our dinner was being able to walk around the mansion and see the decor afterwards.  If we had actually been able to sit on the patio I"m sure the view would have been nice.In summary.... Average age: 65 Food quality: sub par Decor: antique Bill with discount: $110 Recommend? NOWell let me start by saying if your not in great shape (triathlete) don't even attempt to take the stairs that lead up to the mansion. I mean there really should be some warning that if your over age 50 you may not make it up there. So with that being said I think it is clearly a ruse to make sure you pay for Valet parking because if you drive to the top of the hill they will gladly park your car for you and you can walk right into the mansion. We had dinner at Geordie's restaurant because they were offering a $30 per person 3 course meal to promote restaurant week here in phoenix. The food was pretty good....not great. The service was pretty good....but not great. The Mansion was pretty good.....but not great. However the view was great....we got to see the sun sunset along with the beautiful mountains so at least that was a treat. We didn't have dessert but the offerings on the menu looked good...but not great.So I guess you see my point this place is good....not great....so if that is what your looking for then Eat, Drink, and be Merry my Friends!!!!I suddenly knew this was a mistake as soon as we started to scale the steep difficult steps and the handrail covered with a large amount of bird POOP. My stomach turned and I couldn't imagine why they don't have somebody to clean the handrail.We were a few minutes early for our reservation so we walked around a bit. It is an interesting OLD House with narrow hallways and a small room with an old fashioned operators switchboard. It does have beautiful views. The house has a beautiful entrance door and interesting intricate ceilings but over all it really isn't so grand with old worn carpet and common tiles. I thought I'd see a bunch of marble or granite but I didn't.We thought this was an interesting Choice for restaurant week because we wanted to see this place. Also this was one of the few places that gave you three courses without dessert. Also the $10 non member fee was waived for restaurant week.I can't say the food was completely awful but I wouldn't come back for it either even for free so I think that qualifies for the one star rating.We asked about cocktails and our waiter said they were the last page of the wine menu but they weren't and only lasted the liquors. He returned and my husband asked for the cocktail menu we saw outside and the waiter brings us the cocktail menu. I decided on a drink but the waiter didn't return for a long period of time so we decided to just order dinner and skip the cocktails.Our waiter said the Sous Vide Chicken was stuffed with something green and he didn't know what it was but to him it was very salty. He also said the Carpaccio wasn't very good. So we decided to go with the other two starters.The starters were passable but nothing either of us would want again. A not so great crab cake sitting on creamy peas with two refrigerated cold roasted tomatoes. The other was a few slices of eggplant with a little cheese.The middle plates were not so seasoned escargots with a forgettable salad. The highlight was a small chunk of gorgonzola cheese. The other middle plate was not hot and not cold but unhealthy room temperature tomato soup with a over whipped cream laced with truffle aroma. (Aroma means perfume) (and over whipped means turned to butter). We both thought the tomato soup was the best of what we tried here. It tasted like good tomatoes that would be great on a pizza.For dinner we tried the duck and the bronzini. Both were cooked just OK but neither seemed to have good seasoning or flavor however both of our vegetables were salted too heavy. I'd say so heavy I could tell what kind of salt they used and it wasn't good salt. The one thing that I could honestly say WAS terrible was the artichoke , anise sabayon. I tasted it and nearly barffed. I am without words to describe how it tasted but the texture was like hummus. Both plates had what they called polenta towers. They looked (see photo) happy to see us and I thought mine might squirt something when I went to eat it. But I was baffled when I tasted it because it wasn't like polenta. It was like corn muffin mix that was mixed with a farina kind of cereal. It was bready and lacked much of the corn taste and really tasted like cream of wheat cereal.I can almost say forgettable but I can't because I will never forget the bird poop or the polenta tower.1.5 stars almost 2 stars but with price factored in I feel one starSLIGHT UPDATE 9-11-13I read that they got a new chef since my review so hopefully they are better now.Start with one penny and double it, then double the double, and continue doubling daily. You would be a millionaire within 30 days. Know anyone who could pull that off? Not me! For us working folk it takes two weeks of doubling down to afford Sunday brunch for two at Wrigley Mansion ($49pp). Worth it!  The mansion is atop Telewa Trail close to the canal. The best entrance for check-in was on the SE side; upstairs from valet parking. The host was sitting there. But if you use regular parking downhill, then walk up through the pedestrian entrance on the NW side and make your way through the leftmost rooms towards the host. Table was already assigned and we were politely escorted to a white room with big windows. Lighting was wonderful and tables adequately spaced. As soon as we settled in, a server introduced himself to us and gave the banquet 411. Then glasses were promptly filled with freely flowing mimosas. They were refilled several times while dining.Take a moment to give thanks. God bless Abundance. My belly is always on my mind and my mind on my belly. This quality buffet presented a fun bingeful experience for my appetite. Not my waistline though, BUT I am currently in the R&D stage of an invention that burns calories as I eat. It's patented! Binge buffeting is 'bout to be the shizith!Binge. Did I say a bad word? I don't mean it badly. I chose to hit each food section only once and use one plate at each. So I didn't overstuff - loosely speaking. Let me paint the picture: I had four courses - fruit, salad, entre, and dessert and seconds on dessert, but who's counting... Food in the banquet room had been placed at six stations. I stood there with closed eyes pretending that everything was revolving around me. Fooooooood. Here's how it looked; going clockwise.  1. At the long center table was about five hot pots. I remember a pilaf, yellow rice, sauteed vegetable medley, salmon in lobster bisque, and a meat dish. Veggie medley was mildly seasoned. Nothing dark green in the mix so I just took a couple pieces of cauliflower. The salmon was very soft and didn't actually taste like salmon. Maybe it was because of the bisque.  2. On the south wall was the made-to-order pancake and omelet station. This section was manned and those men were a bit stingy with ingredients. Pans were small so my order for a pancake ended up being a weecake. When I asked to have it topped with fresh blueberries, about five berries were doled out. Mr. Omelet Maker was no less stingy. I requested more veggies because he only gave a pinch of my favorites. Literally a pinch.  SUGGESTION: Let the diners self-pick ingredients into a small bowl which they can hand to the servers while ordering pancakes and omelets.3. To the right of omelet pinchville was the dessert spread. I'm pretty sure I was the first binger to crack into them. Cheesecake, chocolate cake, 3 flavors of cupcakes, brownies, apple squares, apple tart, chocolate chip cookies, snickerdoodles, carrot cake, and numerous petite fours including one of pumpkin cheesecake. YUM! 4. A few feet from there was the fresh salad table. Strangely, choices were few and there was only one dressing, maybe two. I remember a huge bowl of crisp romaine lettuce and another bowl of mixed lettuces, also a small platter of roasted peppers and things, olives, onions, capers, pickled condiments. Not much for a salad lover.5. Along the north wall, was the carving and seafood station. There were slabs of red meat which a server sliced thinly for you, crab legs which he cracked for you, and other sea beings like shrimp were served cold. 6. The table along the east wall was by far the longest and most diverse section - the "breakfast" station. On one end huge bowls of cantaloupe, honeydew, strawberries, pineapple, blackberries, watermelon, raspberries. The stars of the fruit show were pineapple and blackberry; both sweet and ooh so juicy. Raspberries were good. Watermelon was okay. Cantaloupe and honeydew unfortunately were unripened. Every bite seemed like rind.   The breakfast table continued with cold stuffs like cereal, yogurt, jams, croissants and danishes, muffins, and then it transitioned to the hot items. There were three or four pots, one with seasoned potatoes. Most likely there was some kind of sausage, and maybe oatmeal too.This club definitely caters highly to its customers. Staff was bustling nonstop to clear away empty plates and refill glasses. The bill was brought to the table after we finished - a first in my buffet experience.  Minor annoyance: Every time we left the table, we'd come back to find napkins refolded and placed neatly at our places. So all morning the server was touching and retouching everyone's dirty napkin. SUGGESTION: Stop that! Leave my napkin alone OR give me a clean one. I would definitely come again, but at mansion prices the buffet is the only meal I would  consider returning for.

You threw my sandwich away... my sandwich.... MY SANDWICH! My friends always tease me when we are searching for a good sandwich shop.  I have been told on more then one occassion that I can be little "Ross" or "Joey"  like from the show  "Friends" when it comes to my sandwiches. Today, we went to Breadcrafters Bakery and Cafe for lunch, and it was absolutely delicious. I've had many sandwiches from all over the valley and the folks at Breadcrafters Bakery and Cafe are doing up sandwiches right. Lookout,  AJ's Whole Foods, Jimmy Johns, Quiznos, Capriottis, and all the others; Breadcrafters Bakery and Cafe is here.Breadcrafters offers great lunch specials.  You can get a sandwich and your choice of potato salad, pasta salad, fruit salad,  or chips.  Today, my lunch companion and I had the tuna salad on sourdough and the Focaccia Deluxe  (turkey,ham, salami, provolone, lettuce, tomatoes, Parmesan pesto, on Italian herb bread) with a side of potato salad and fruit salad.  I have to admit the Parmesean Pesto spread  was fantastic and the potato salad is the best I ever had. All the breads at Breadcrafters Bakery and Cafe are made fresh daily.  The Walnut Pecan Raisin, Swiss & Black Pepper, look delicious.  I can't wait to try them all on my next visit.If your in the area give Breadcrafters a try.  Expect great sandwiches, salads, soups, desserts, and the best customer service.

Review Text :
On my recent road trip from Dallas to New Haven, CT, Randy S. and I stopped in Pittsburgh to revel in its charms. This, I must add, was in opposition to his mother's strong protests to the effect of, "There's nothing *in* Pittsburgh, why would anyone go there?" Tazza D'oro is the answer to that question. Especially if you like coffee. This is easily one of the best coffee shops east of the Mississippi, and I've been to a lot of them. So, what's so good about it?Let's go in order of importance:Coffee - It is really, really good. They use Batdorf and Bronson beans, where an ex-gf of mine used to work in Olympia. Believe me when I tell you that B&B is good. It's not amazingly great, but it's very solid and they take roasting seriously. When I go to a new coffee place I suspect might be good I always get a latte. Why? This one has a high upside if done well and the lowest downside (lots of milk) if done poorly. I got a latte. They have a few sizes, 12oz was the first one I got. It was fantastic. They did a nice little rosetta in it too (look up latte art on google if you have no idea what this is). The baristo really knew what he was doing and pulled a some good shots with excellent crema. The coffee was so good (coffee is supposed to taste bold, smooth and rich, which it almost never does and this place had it down) I had to go back for an 8oz, which is another level of trust. It has the same amount of coffee but less milk to hide poor coffee quality. It was always superior. This is a coffee place that is truly top notch based on the coffee alone, but there was more. Pastries - They all looked amazing. I had a plain donut while I waited in line. Normally I don't eat plain donuts, because life is too short for plain donuts, but it was really, very good. Everyone was commenting on how nice the pastries were.Atmosphere - This place has it exactly right. It's a mom & pop feel, nothing forced. Some tables, outdoor seating, maybe some local art, but not in a goofy sort of way. Very friendly employees. Just a complete home run. Obviously I loved it. Behind me in line for my re-up, I heard a girl behind me in line complain, "we could just go to Starbucks, it's cheaper!" then proceeded to order with sugar free syrups and skim milk. That's fine. Everyone has to do what they like... and with the proliferation of bad coffee (Starbucks only being guilty of mediocre, though a little bit interesting coffee) over the past 10 years, I don't blame people for being set that way. But the beautiful thing about Tazza D'Oro (cup of gold in Italian) is that--if you let it--it will remind you that you don't need to make your coffee up like a drag queen on Halloween.Tazza D'Oro stands as a reminder that coffee can be enjoyed in all its naked glory in an awesome setting on a beautiful street and give you a good f'ing reason to go to Pittsburgh.What a cute little coffee shop in such an idealistic setting!  I sat amongst the gathered hipsters, moms, friends, ladies who lunch, power business lunch people in a sunny little corner of the room sipping my delicious Indian Spice black tea.Service was very friendly and looking at the fresh pastries and lunch list of homemade soups and sandwiches made me want to come back and enjoy a leisurely afternoon or perhaps work day here taking in all they have to offer.  I was surprised when I asked to see the tea list and the barista told me they didn't have much to offer.  Still looked like a good amount to me and I was pleased to see a variety of different offerings some coffee shops don't offer (because, well, they're usually coffee focused!).  I also enjoy that they use loose leaf tea, so you know it's not just coming straight outta a generic box of Twinings.  FREE internet is always a big plus with lots of outlets.  Now if someone could just find me an affordable house in Highland Park this could just be my next favorite neighborhood coffee shop!

Review Text :
I can't rate Thai Lahna higher than 3 stars, although their Thai Coffee and Thai tea are 5-star worthy. The food was just okay. In fact, it read more appealing on the menu, which is gigantic. How is one ever suppose to decide?My lunch buddy and I went today to try Thai Lahna for the first time. It was pretty full around 12:30. I snagged a table. Service was prompt and we had waters in no time. We ordered a shrimp app that was made in chili/lime sauce with mint and lemongrass. Uhm, it was okay. The shrimp is nothing to write home about, but I did enjoy munching on the bed of lettuce that was drenched in the spicy sauce. I really, really, really wanted this to knock my socks off, for the seasonings sounded like they would create an "oh my god" experience. What a shame.I ordered the Eggplant Jay, since it came highly recommended. Little did I know I'd have to fight off 500,000 onions for one piece of super delicious eggplant. Not my idea of a good time. I really wish this dish could have been better. The eggplant was good - what there was of it.My friend ordered veggies in red curry with coconut. It was pretty tasty, until you bit into a sliver of corn and about fell out of your chair from the punch of salt. Wowza. Price was decent. The app ended up costing more than either of our entrees, which was strange to me. But, oh well. It averaged out to about $20 a person for all that, drinks and tip included. Parking is a cinch, since it's in public lot. I had no problem finding a spot during the lunch rush.SOMETHING STRANGE: We weren't asked if we wanted to box up our left overs until AFTER we had paid and were getting ready to leave. I thought that was strange. But, it would have been one thing if I had really wanted to take the food home with me. I didn't. Chance of my coming back here? Same chance as UCONN winning the NCAA tournament this year. 0%, thanks to an upset by San Diego. What a game... The next time I'm craving Thai, I'll stick with Malee's, like Pierre said.So I really wanted to Yelp something today. So, a buddy (@groovypucks) and I went to Thai Lahna.  I noticed it had a LOT of reviews and still maintained a pretty reputable score!  Hey, its only a block or two from work, so why not?We get there and are immediately seated which in my opinion is rare.  For the rave reviews, I noticed it was kind of 'dead' for a lunch crowd.  A few old people and the owners were all I really noticed.  We get a booth seat (I love booth seats.  If I could work, sleep and eat in a booth seat, I would die a happy man) so I am already getting excited.  Groovypucks and I take way too long looking at the menu and finally decide on our dishes (which we accompanied with a Thai Tea).  I asked to make my curry spicy(#36 Yellow Curry Chicken with Green Beans), and it WAS!  Almost too spicy, but I attribute that to my lack of experience with their dishes.  If I were to order it again, I would order it medium.Groovy got a Peanut and Chicken dish (#35) with onions and peppers.  I tried a bit, as I am comfortable in my sexuality, and I really liked it.  It was Damn good! That's right, Capital D!  The service for the rest of the meal was below par, but not to the point that it was annoying.  It just took a little too long to get my food and my check at the end......And with this review I leave you with my fortuneIf strength were all,tiger would not fear scorpion.Mmmm.... Thai Lahna. Thai Lahna is the person you spy from across the room that you're not too sure about but then after talking to them you find out that they're pretty damn cool. Yeah, that's my Thai Lahna.My group walked into the store front restaurant and were greeted immediately. Some of the crew had already arrived and arranged for a large table to be assembled. Nice! We sat down to look over the menu. I already knew that I wanted to order the pad thai because that's my "test dish" for thai places I've never been to. I also selected the masaman curry. There were six of us and everyone got dishes to share. When the food came out, it was a TON of food. We decided to do the good ol' Yelp Conveyer belt (chomp, chomp, give). My pad thai and my curry were spot on, and perfectly spicy. Everything I had was very good. I don't think I had an issue with anything. So why not a 5 star review? Simply put it's not the best Thai food that I've had, but it's pretty damn close and the service was a bit lacking. Thai Lahna is a must try if you're in the mood for some savory, spicy food!I recently was craving Thai food and came across some pretty stunning reviews for Thai Lahna. I must say... I was REALLY impressed! My table started with the vegetarian hot and sour soup. Everyone really seemed to enjoy the flavors and the plethora of veggies. I love those little flaming soup bowls they use. I ordered the yellow curry with tofu, mild/medium as my entree. That is generally my staple Thai item and it was REALLY good. Extremely flavorful and a great portion size. The restaurant itself was pretty small and the bathroom scenario left a little to be desired, but I was certainly impressed with our quality of service. We split the bill four ways and added a cash to-go order. The poor girl handled our complicated check out very well. I can't believe I lived within walking distance from Thai Lahna for over a year and missed out on such a delicious place!!Woo hoo! Thai Lahna now has a website: http://thailahna.com/index.html. It will be so much easier for me to order to-go now!When I have a hankerin' for a new Thai place, I contact Chris T.  He recommended Thai Lahna and I am a bit perturbed that it's so close to my house.  You see, I go pretty often.  Like twice a month.  I always get the #35, which is a peanut dish in a brown sauce.  It's orgasmic.  Seriously.  It comes with chicken, but you can substitute tofu, which is key in my book.  Staff is very friendly, though I almost always get take-out.  I drool as I drive home with my bag neatly closed, smelling it down Indian School.I could seriously eat here every day! I have been coming to Thai Lahna since I was young and the Pad Thai is always a must (comes with chicken AND shrimp)! This last time we went, I ordered the Tohm Khah Kai soup (add a side of rice) and it was literally out of this world. The best part was that it came flaming! {Great for Yelp photos! ;)} My boyfriend and I were practically drinking the bowl by the time we were done. It is definitely enough for 2-4 to share before your main meal. It is the BEST dish on a cool winter evening! Since Thai Lahna is only a bike ride from my house, I will 100% be back soon!

Review Text :
I would give this restaurant 0 stars if I could.  The food was lousy, the drinks were expensive, and the service was awful.I complained to the manager about my experience and he told that if I didn't like it, there were plenty of other bars in The Strip District.Please, please, please go somewhere else.Yuck!It's almost embarrassing having this place exist in the Strip with so many tourists coming here.  That has to be how they're making their money because it's certainly not on their food or service.  Well, maybe it's the booze too...I don't even know where to begin.  Service was horrible.  The lunch took 2 hours.  On a leisurely Sunday that may be fine, but there was no leisure.  At least not with drinks not in hand until a 1/2 an hour after we sat down.  I'd say lunch was served another 1/2 to 45 minutes later.  It didn't matter though, I knew it wasn't going to be anything spectacular.  I'd heard rumors about the food.  I won't go into any details but I wouldn't trust some items on the menu.  I just played it safe and ordered a veggie salad.  The salad was in the entree section, so I assumed it would be a full size salad.  It was not.  It was a side salad with a handful of grilled veggies on top.  Nothing spectacular.  And a side salad at almost $11.  Not worth it.  If you are forced to stop in because you're dying of hunger, stick to a liquid diet:)Friends warned me not to eat here. Turns out they were GOOD friends. This was just awful, start to finish. Slow (pitiful) service, nasty food ( and we each sprung for the lobster roll -- if you can call it that!) and a generally miserable experience. And this was an early lunch with very few customers around. The only thing remotely redeemable was that we sat on the balcony overlooking Penn avenue and were entertained by the people below. People watching can be a blast. I wanted a draft beer and was told that "we don't serve draft beer upstairs". What??? There's a bar there!! Are you kidding me?? So water it was and that took a long time to arrive. And without straws - another wait after I had the audacity to ask for them.  The "lobster rolls" arrived and looked mighty meager. That's not a lobster roll!! But I pressed on. As I got it closer to my mouth there was a slight aroma. But press on. The "lobster" was sparse, tough, and flavorless. How often could you say that about lobster??? Exactly!! It must have been harvested years ago and waited for me to show up so it could make its way out of the freezer. At $15 each this falls clearly into the ripoff category.  And trying to get our check? Ridiculous. I won't be back. Ever.

Restaurant name  The Capital Grille
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
Ok ok ok....yes, Capital Grille is 'spensive, and it's a upscale chain but my oh my do I love it. I love the atmosphere, I love the steak, I love the Stoli Doli martinis, I love the cheesecake with the torched topping...what can I say, I'm a sucker for a great steak accompanied by great service. I only come to Cap Grille for special occasions, as it's certainly no cheap meal. Hubs and I can easily spend $150-$200 for a meal here (includes a few courses and adult beverages). Hence, during Charlotte's Restaurant Week(s) we always try to schedule in an affordable, delicious meal. The service here has been nothing but extraordinary every time I've walked in - whether I was just having a martini at the bar or a full-fledged meal al fresco. I'm a big fan of the shrimp cocktail - pretentious, sure, but it's composed of colossal shrimp and the perfect spicy cocktail sauce. Their filet is just so incredible, they have always cooked it exactly to my preferences, save one particular undercooked occasion which they immediately remedied with swift service and a very sweet apology. As for their sides, the asparagus w/Hollandaise, creamed spinach and potatoes au gratin will certainly stop your heart literally and figuratively. And last but not least, their desserts are just delectable. Per my opening remarks, their cheesecake is out of this world. It's a round, rich cheesecake with a semi-torched top and served with a smattering of fresh berries. YUM. Every time I leave Capital Grille I feel very full but very, very happy!I've been dying to come here to get my steak on, but the menu prices are downright daunting! This time around we made reservations to partake in their Restaurant Week menu, and it is the most affordable way to experience one of the better restaurants in the area.The Capital Grill may be a chain, but it definitely doesn't feel like it. From the interior decor to the service to the actual food, everything screams upscale fancy-smancy...not something that is usually associated with a chain. We made reservations (highly recommended) and were seated almost immediately.Our server was very friendly and brutally honest. I guess she was forced to try to upsell us a $17 glass of wine but then told us how ridiculous it is and we shouldn't bother with it. When we did choose a bottle of wine she detoured us to a different bottle that was the same price but was more well-received. I'm glad we went with her recommendation because it ended up being an awesome bottle that we would have overlooked otherwise. For the first course of the Restaurant Week menu I had the New England Clam Chowder. I am a sucker for clam chowda and this stuff was great. It wasn't overly heavy with cream and had a ridiculous amount of succulent clam chunks in it. This chowda definitely didn't skimp on the seafood, and the clams, potatoes and bacon were all melded nicely for some of the best I've had in awhile. The missus got the field green salad which was very nice, and came with an excellent champagne dressing that worked very well with the veggies. I was almost a little jealous of her salad, but I had chowder in front of me, so that feeling didn't last long.The Restaurant Week menu was decent for entrees, with a few steak options as well as a chicken and salmon. I ordered the 14oz bone-in sirloin and this was one of the most magnificent steaks I've had in the Queen City. It was cooked to a perfect medium rare just as I ordered it, and it was a tender, juicy, tasty steak with an excellent beef flavor. It was such a huge steak that I only ate half and saved the rest for a leftover dinner the next night! The missus had the Citrus Glazed Seared Salmon. It was a very nice piece of salmon that wasn't overpowering, and the glaze was really tasty. Her plate also came with some roasted asparagus that were cooked perfectly and had a nice sauce drizzled on top. Our table was also served shared side dishes of mashed potatoes and green beans. The potatoes were crazy rich, creamy and delicious, and there were still a few nice lumps mixed within the majority of the velvety mass, making these potatoes freaking awesome. The green beans were also tasty, and were tossed with tomatoes to give it a little extra pop.For dessert we both shared the Cheesecake and Flourless Chocolate Espresso Cake. The cheesecake was actually more like a mousse, and so it was light as opposed to dense. It tasted wonderful and the top is caramelized to give it a crisp bite. It was served alongside a few berries and strawberry glaze, which made one delicious mouthful. The chocolate cake was just as good, if not slightly better. The espresso flavor is very light so if you're not a coffee fan don't be afraid to give this a whirl. The consistency of the cake was more like a chewy fudge, making it extremely decadent. The Capital Grill is the place to go, so long as you have to cash. The food is all excellent and I would love to go back and try some other stuff out. The ambiance, service and food all scream swank, and it definitely feels like it warrants the extravagant price tag.It's not normally like me to eat at a steak house, or a chain at that, and it's certainly not like me to give a chain steakhouse a 5 star rating.  But I definitely tip my cap to Cap Grille.  It's obvious why Consumer Reports rated it the #1 chain in the country.  Sure it's expensive, but the quality of the service and food is superb.  I had met someone there for a "business" lunch so we were both wearing black slacks - immediately after being seated the host handed us black napkins so that we wouldn't get any white fuzz on our slacks. (Brilliant!) The waiter was very friendly and described all of the options for us in great detail.  We started with the calamari which was outstanding - it blew me away that seafood could be so good in the desert (it had probably come in on the same flight I did from Boston)!  We both had 10oz sirloin steaks encrusted in ground decaf Kona coffee with a butter sauce.  Exquisite.  The waiter and bus boys were very attentive the whole meal.  I didn't find cap grille to be pretentious at all.  I mean, all of the patrons wearing suits and it cost us $60pp incl tax and tip for an app, an entree, and a drink.  So if that is pretentious (and people seem to think that is what makes a place pretentious) then fine.  But I didn't find anyone to be super snotty or rude - the service was impeccable. I would definitely go back here or to any other location, but only for an extra special occasion or if I can claim it as a business expense and get reimbursed!Huh.  Dang.  Darn it.  Shoot.  I was really looking forward to lunch here.  Parking at this location is beyond ridiculous, no, I didn't valet cause I wanted to shop after wards.  But who cares?  I was here for a great meal!  Things started off well, great folks at the hostess desk.  Attractive interior, beautiful dark rich woods, attractive lighting, dark plantation blinds, very nice table.  My server Paula was extremely nice and had the cutest accent.  I liked a lot of the choices on the menu, but on an impulse, decided on the salad with filet medallions and onions straws.  The first bite of steak was extraordinary, perfectly cooked, wonderful seasonings and flavor.  Fresh pieces of asparagus in the salad was a nice surprise.  Then the shocker.  The next medallion was under cooked, the next was over cooked and the rest were grisley.  Needless to say, I could not eat it.  My server was very apologetic.  And then the manager immediately appeared as if he had been shot out of a canon.  He apologized profusely.  I was very understanding, I mean everyone has a bad day, right?   And of course he offered another dish, but I declined.  I mean, the mood was gone.  But then again, this is why I don't eat at home. The salad was taken off my check, as should be expected.  I did have dessert, hell yes, I was still hungry!  I got the hazelnut chocolate cake, which was totally awesome and even pretty to look at.  It was big enough to feed an army, don't know if it was a regular slice or if they were trying to make up for the salad.  So, a really mixed review.  I will try Capital Grill, again.  And I hope to have much better results.9/22Came to try their Restaurant Week menu, and sat at one of the tables at the bar section of the restaurant.  I liked its subdued and quaint atmosphere; however, the smooth jazz music's volume was turned up significantly as the afternoon turned into dusk.  It's a good thing I enjoy smooth jazz.Chose the French onion soup starter, the Kona-crusted sirloin steak entree, and cheesecake w/ fresh berries sauce to finish.  I really enjoyed the onion soup- salty from the cheese, yet just enough sweetness from the caramelized onions.  I really liked how some areas of the cheese that blanketed the bowl were crispy!  I thought perhaps it was the bread that sometimes one would find below the cheese, but no, it was the cheese itself.  Wished the whole piece was crunchy...I absolutely adored the Kona-crusted sirloin.  Cooked to medium- perfect!- and I could taste the coffee, too, and not just feel the texture of coffee grains, as I've ordered similar entrees from other venues, but never tasted the intended effect.  The caramelized shallot cream sauce absolutely floored me!  One of the best sauces that has graced my lips :)  Mmm... The entree came with two standard sides (no substitutes allowed, or at least that was what I was told) of creamed spinach and smashed red potatoes.  Both were delightful- decadently rich and creamy.  Before I forget, the table bread basket (seeded dinner rolls and lavosh) was good, especially the seeded rolls.  You may also order toasted sourdough if you have food allergies to avoid.Stepping back down, but not much, from the piece de resistance (in this meal, the standout was the steak), was the creme brulee cheesecake w/ berry sauce w/ fresh berries!  Simply incredible!   While I had to return the more beautiful (more caramelized sugar crust) first offering, untouched, due to food issues, the second was less visually stunning, but tasted divine.  I should've asked for more sauce on the side, as I ended up taking some home.  (Believe me, it took all of my willpower to stop myself from inhaling the whole dish!)I would definitely love to go back again!I visit this Capital Grille location several times a year... usually for some kind of work meeting or special occasion.  While my visits can cost a pretty penny, I've never been disappointed.  Most recently I was at TCG for a Master Wine Tasting event, which was a great deal... and it's a promotion that is taking place at dinner time now through our crazy Summer (ending September 5th).For $25 per person, TCG offers generous pours of up to 11 wine selections.  We sampled quite a variety of vino: sparkling, red, and white, from Napa Valley, Italy, and New Zealand.  I'm no wine connoisseur, but I enjoyed them all! And for $40 more, ($65 total), TCG does a food pairing to go with the wine selections. On the night we were there, our courses included Lobster and Crab Cake, Pan-Fried Calamari, Cedar Planked Salmon,Lamb Chop, Sirloin, and Flourless Chocolate Espresso Cake.Not the healthiest meal, but it sure was a foodie experience!  My favorites were the calamari and the flourless chocolate cake.  The rest of the group I dined with enjoyed it all as well... You cannot go wrong with escaping the heat this summer and spending an evening at The Capital Grille with their special tasting menus!How have I not written a review for The Capital Grille until now? Three words: Coconut Cream Pie. I'm not even a fan of coconut or these types of desserts, but whatever they put in this dessert is addicting. It's the combination of creamy coconut filling, with a flaky yet soft crust and then the very best part is the caramel. I could eat an entire serving on my own. So whatever you do, don't stuff yourself too much on the delicious steak so you miss out on this dessert!Now on to the rest of the meal. This Capital Grille has a great location, very friendly staff and a great environment...not to mention the amazing food! Not only do they have a large selection of comfortable booths, but they also have a private room in the back that's perfect for hosting a large group. I've been to a luncheon in the private room before and it was very comfortable. The steak here is top quality and fresh! It's tender to the touch and better with each bite. I absolutely love their Lobster Mac N Cheese along with their Au Gratin potatoes. Get both and happily roll out of their like I do! My favorite meal consists of a the Capital Grille chopped salad, the Filet Oscar (topped with crab meat), sharing the Lobster Mac and Au Gratin and completing the gluttonous experience with the Coconut Cream Pie. It's worth every calorie and then some. Important Notes:- They serve lunch and often do amazing three course lunch specials. - During the summer, they do dining after dark which means they offer a special prix fix menu starting after 8 PM that includes an appetizer, two entrees, two drinks and dessert all for $50!- Make a reservation, especially on weekends and during the busy season. A special fun fact: - I learned an amazing piece of information about their giving. Every day, they give away all the left over food to a local charity, so no food goes to waste!Review on The Capital Grille bar:The bartenders here know how to make mean drinks, but it's the Stoli Doli that is an absolute must! They even showcase the pineapple slices soaking in vodka right on the counter, it's beautiful as it is refreshingly, delicious! They serve food at the bar, but my favorite appetizer thus far is the Pan-fried Calamari it's the perfect savory, spicy, fried treat to pair with a cool chilled drink!The service is always great, bartenders are easy to talk to and never pushy. The ambience of the bar is like that of the restaurant, it's dark and laid back. An absolutely great way to spend an evening or for a quick drink.

Restaurant name  Pancho's Mexican Buffet

Review Text :
OK. Do not judge me. Do not send me scornful, hurtful messages. And do not preach to me the hazards, both socially and physically, of eating at buffets. Because, frankly, I've done that to myself already. Eating at Mexican buffets was part of the bf's growing up days in San Antonio. One day he asked me to go, and since he's irresistible to me, I said yes. Upon entering Pancho's, I realized it was like a Mexican Chuck E Cheese. More kids than you'd find at Mia Farrow's house. Running in between and around my legs. Screaming, laughing, crying. Totally out of control. And this is all while we're standing in line. Suddenly I find my throat to be dry, irritated and burning. Why is there a white haze wafting from the hallway? Oh. Some darling little child had activated the FIRE EXTINGUISHER! Yea. And mommy was too busy ordering her Dos XX to notice. You'd think this would have sent us running. But we persevered. I thought I'd be safe and get a taco, enchilada with beans and rice. All were simply horrific. Malo. Horrible. No bueno. The more I recall this day, the more I feel a need for a buffet support group of some kind. Hello, my name is Thomas. I ate at Pancho's. HELLO THOMAS! Good bye Panchos.Aye, Pancho's!   When you're good, you're very, very good, but when you're bad, you're horrid!Okay, so here's the secret to a potentially enjoyable, or at least tolerable, dining experience in a cheap ass dive of a restaurant:Go knowing it'll suck.  Go because it is a consistent suck, and the suck you know is better than the suck you don't.You may end up pleasantly surprised.  Happens to me all the time.(If you don't expect it to taste like a PIZZA at all, a Totino's frozen cracker with sauce and toppings can actaully be a little tasty.)Pancho's has all that I love in a cheapo boofay.  There's a lot of variety to choose from, and of course, as much as you can stuff in your gullet.  They even have the added benefit of a server to bring you your seconds and beyond.  I just wish the food was more consistent.If you go on a day that the cooks know what they're doing with the fryer, it makes all the difference in the world.  There are a lot of items that are cooked that way - chicken taquitos, turkey flautas, tortilla chips, sopaipillas, etc - that are so good when they achieve the proper consistency on the delicate "Crispy~Greasy Spectrum", but so nasty when they are not.The salsas are actually pretty good.  They have a few from which to choose, from mild and tomatoey to a chunky&HOT roasted number.  They used to have one of the better tomatillo salsa verdes I've had, but I don't think they make it anymore.Your best bet seems to be to avoid the busiest times with the most children.  Lunch or late weeknights should be okay.  Unless you're bringing a group of kids, who should LOVE IT here.On bad days, it's easily a 1, but on good days it can be a 3.5, so I'm going with a rating of 3, as long as you go knowing what to expect.To a realist, the glass is always full - half with water, half with air.  I eat at crappy places and enjoy it.Stone me.I had not expected anything fabulous.  It is what it is.  Cheap, not steller, food.  But quick and kinda cool that you can choose whatever you like and then YOU don't have to go back for more, your wait person will do it for you.  You just ttell them what you want and they will get it.  So if all you like here are tacos....just gorge yourself on tacos!  It's really not a bad  deal and if you have a family with teenagers who want to eat everything in site...well, here is the place for you!  The place was clean although I did not use the restroom so I can't comment on that.  I spoke with the manager as we were leaving and he was very personable and seemed open to constructive critisism.  Apparently he just took over.  So, if you go knowing this is not going to be the best mexican food in town, then it's fine.  Not a bad value.  Thanks Panchos.

Review Text :
Possibly the best kept vegetarian secret in Charlotte.Went for a "romantic" birthday dinner. He had reserved the table thru their website, leaving "birthday" in the comments- and they'd sprinkled the table (really sweet, sits in an alcove, isolated and quiet) with balloon confetti. Great little touch.From door to check, the service was impeccable, (thanks Page!) without being stuffy. The wine we'd wanted to try wasn't in stock any longer, so we were given a perfectly chilled taste of the new pinot grigio they're carrying before making our decision. Great wine, decent price.The decor was so Art Nouveau it was leaning towards camp - but I love anything from that era, so that was fine by me. Delicate lighting, warm and comfy. This is their third? relocation - and it looks as though they're planning to stay awhile, as there is obviously a lot of time, thought and money invested in the decor. Nice space between tables, a variety of seating options, lovely. I wonder if they'd be better placed Uptown, since the surrounding restaurants are a little lower-key, but I'm totally cool with not having to deal with all that entails to come here.The food ranged from good to impressive. Our mushroom tart with beets and microgreens was the low point of the meal, but was still delish. Grilled grape salad was simple but impressive, surrounded by a white balsamic reduction so subtle that it was almost honey. This is the only high cuisine restaurant I know of in Charlotte that does a unique vegetarian main each night as a special - and at 16.50 for my cauliflower cream pot pie (topped by perfect puff pastry, made in-house) it's accessible to anyone. I overheard other specials being ordered at double that price. But if you can stand to keep it veg, Carpe is an incredible bargain. Being the annoyingly inquisitive Yelper that I am, I had some questions involving hypotheticals - what if a troop of vegan friends were staying with me sometime in the future and I wanted to treat them to an amazing meal? Not a problem, said the chef - give me a week's notice, and I'll have a fully vegan experience prepared. Amazing.Not that I have any allergies or dietary restrictions (well, other than the veg thing), but this is the place to take relatives and friends that do. They are ready and willing to cater to any need. But you should come here anyway, although for us, it will be for special occasions. Our bill landed right at 100 for three courses, beverages, and tip. Easily worth it.Seize the day and get your hungry self over to Carpe Diem. While Carpe Diem is a little fancy pants to just roll into with jorts and a Dale Jr. tee, make the effort. It's a lovely restaurant- beautifully appointed and as Julia S points out - stellar service and impeccable pacing. I've taken many of visiting family members here and I've never had anything less than an extraordinary meal. It's not a cheap meal, but it's well priced for the quality and quantity. For two of us with a few courses and a bottle of mid-price wine we usually spend about $120-$150 (including tip). Some of my favorites...Warm Goat Cheese (salad): I mean, really, it's warm goat cheese over delicious greens with hazelnut crunch. It's so good you basically want to start fist pumping through the restaurant.Cheese Plate: A very generous and tantalizing plate of cheese of the day. As Julia said - the accompaniments make it stellar. Scallops: I've had them so many different ways here I can't even count. One time they had some vanilla essence another atop of risotto. Both times they were out of this world. Cooked and seasoned perfectly. Plus they give you a very generous portion of large scallops. YUM.Desserts: They special make their desserts daily and I wish I could remember what I've had here. I know I've had some delicious type of creme brulee and something uber chocolately. Regardless, I don't think anyone would be disappointed with their dessert selection!

Review Text :
The best place to get a beer in Charlotte, period. I used to live right down the road from the Saucer and went there several times a week in order to earn my own gold plate up on the wall (something you get after drinking 200 different beers). The selection is unmatched in the Charlotte area, and the wait staff is usually really knowledgeable about all the new beers they get in. Monday nights are $2.75 "pint nights" where everything on the wall (and we're talking nearly 100 beers here) is only $2.75, and considering the quality of some of these this is almost impossible to beat ANYWHERE!The glass program on Wednesday night is really cool, and if you go to their website there is even a big trading community so you can find some pretty cool stuff that the local one doesn't offer. The tracking system they use is actually really great too. It's awesome to be able to see every beer you've ever had there, including the date, and your rating and comments about it.The food at the bar is, well, bar food. If you're expecting something amazing for dinner here then you're definitely here for the wrong reason. While not quite as bad as you would expect, it's still the standard grease-laden goodies that just seem to go great with beer.The one detriment to this place for me was that they allow smoking inside. I would dock them a point for this normally, but the reasonable person in me still realizes that it is a bar, and it is in NC, so it's almost allowable. The saving grace is that there is a great patio outside where you can go if cancer isn't your thing.One final personal note: if you come here and order Bud Light (or some other equivalent) you're wasting space and need to be eradicated.Very unusual GastropubI'm running behind and actually thought I had already posted this review but apparently I did not. Back in May, two of my friends from Ohio went to the 300 race at Charlotte Motor Speedway and had dinner here afterwards.It's a nice place with good service and a somewhat whimsical menu.  Main selling point is their Saucer Club where you consume 200 different beers or ales and you get a Saucer with your name on it mounted on the walls or ceiling.  Considering the number of different bottled beers and ales and the broad selection on tap which changes weekly, not hard to have two hundred different one.Food is a bit of an afterthough but what they do have is very good. I have the Reuben-esque, while my friends had a Saucer Dipster and the Chicken Sandwich. The Chicken Sandwich sound plain but with the bacon, guacamole, pepper jack cheese, etc, is anything butRoom is like an old pub with the exception of the several hundred Saucers on the Walls and Ceiling from those who have come before and have been sucessful

Review Text :
We've been living in Charlotte for a year now, and we've been to quite a few restaurants in our time. However, while I have found that perfect BBQ joint I dreamed of, I had not yet happened across the quintessential place for good ol' Southern cooking...in particular fried chicken. Well, that is now a thing of the past, for I have found Merts.You could tell just from walking inside that it was going to be a great Southern food experience. The interior of the restaurant is colorful and eye-catching, and the art and decor screams Southern. The interior was full to capacity, but we were able to snag a table outside. The outdoor area is a mixed bag. While it's nowhere near as crowded as inside (with only four tables or so) the Charlotte pedestrians take it upon themselves to walk through the outdoor area. It was a bit disruptive to be eating a nice meal while people constantly walked right against your table. I wasn't a fan of the beer list since Merts does not carry any drafts, so I stuck with unsweet tea. After placing our orders the server came over with a small loaf of cornbread for each of us. This cornbread was spot on for me! Not gritty, a little sweet and extremely crumbly. You could tell it was fresh from the oven, and that made it super awesome!For dinner I ordered the beef ribs and leg quarter fried chicken combo. I wasn't crazy about the ribs themselves, as they were a bit tough and chunks of bone kept flaking off. I did enjoy the sauce, as it was a sweet and tangy sauce and not vinegary. Now the chicken was THE BOMB! I've been searching for fried chicken down here, and have been disappointed time and again. So far I am confident to say that Merts has the best fried chicken (though I haven't made it over to Price's yet, so don't jump on me for that yet.) The battered skin was light and crisp, and not greasy. The interior was that moist and juicy you expect from fried chicken. I was in heaven scoffing that chicken down, and I wish I had more right now! The miss' ordered the catfish and fried chicken breast combo, and that was also pretty dang awesome. The catfish was a huge filet just plopped on the plate. The meat came right off and was so light and tasty. The batter was also perfect, with not too much that didn't take away from the soft flavor of the fish. They serve it with this spicy sauce that was a good compliment to the fish. The chicken breast was just as good as my leg. Even the white meat stayed juicy and tender! The miss' didn't eat too much of it after filling up on the fish, so there are plenty of chicken leftovers in my future!The other thing that Merts does damn good is sides. One problem I've had at BBQ and other places down here is that the meats are perfect, yet the sides are extremely lacking. Merts has some of the best dang sides money can buy. We both ordered the mac & cheese and it was simply the best I've had down here. Some places I've been to make it watery or oily or just not flavored right, but Merts had it all. It was a firm consistency with a great cheesy flavor, and the cheese crust on top was awesome. I also tried black eyed peas for the first time and loved them. They were cooked perfectly and were served in this kind of gravy that was also tasty. The miss' ordered the collard greens and I have to say that I liked those too. I'm generally not a fan of collards as they are bitter, but these were cooked in such a way that the bitterness was taken down a notch or two. They had some citrus flavoring to them that helped tone it down and added a different level of flavor to. All in all, the sides kicked butt! Unfortunately we were so stuffed from this massive meal that we did not stick around for dessert.I have to say, when I think home cooked Southern fare, I will always associate it with Merts. They can fry up some mean chicken and fish, and their sides and veggies are top notch. It's a busy place but it is definitely worth the trip.Mert's is one of those go-to, Charlotte staple, consistently filling, always busy, and good-luck-finding-a-seat kind of spots you can't miss if you're a regular diner around town. Even if you're in town for an extended stay, Mert's should fall on your radar within in the first few days. Where I'm not a huge soul/comfort food goer on the regular, the fried chicken, fried catfish, mac n' cheese and other sides have all sang beautifully upon my many visits. One thing that sticks out more frequently and consistently beckons my palate is the lemonade. Goodness gracious, it's that good. Sometimes, I think of stopping in just for a big glass to go. One thing to keep in mind about Mert's is that it functions quite differently than other Uptown culinary hearths. This place is busy throughout the week and the weekends. Not uncommon for them to be on a wait well into a Sunday afternoon. Plan accordingly, should you find yourself visiting during any "peak" hour. Service is ever-so friendly and I love the "shoe art(?)" in the men's bathroom. Kind of odd, but definitely worth a gander if you've never seen it. Mert's, thank you. Just...for everything.This review I would say would be a pretty weak 4 star.First time here. I was in town for a conference and me and my friends just did Crossfit so I asked the concierge at my hotel to direct me to a place where I can get my grub on... He asks like chicken and stuff? I said like Mac and cheese and ribs and all that Good stuff lol and this is where it brought me.It's a small southern comfort food style place. My expectations ran high as I saw Guy Fieri "was here". Plus who could go wrong with comfort food right?The restaurant hours didn't close till about half an hour after we walked in.And one of the waiters didn't want to sit us in his area because he didn't want to serve any more tables on his side. Well thanks Pal. The restaurant really isn't that big.Anywhooooo...We ordered and our waitress was kind of snappy. I guess she was overwhelmed and tired that day that she wanted to close the restaurant already. I wanted to order the ribs with Mac and cheese and string bean. But the waitress informed us there wasn't anymore. Okay... How about the corn on the cob? We're out of that too. As I grew frustrated and hungry, I just opted out totally off the second side dish. Out of everything , I was looking forward to the Mac and cheese more than anything.Our cornbread came right away, served nice and warm. delicious! But our entrees took a while.Then a miracle happened! The kitchen staff was so kind enough to make a batch of fresh Mac and cheese. Praise the Lord!And purely because of that reason, I gave them one extra star for that really kind gesture.Our food came and it really was a mouthful. My ribs was DROWNED in sauce and oil. Tasted good like any other ribs to me. Mac and cheese was great. String bean was really soggy . I don't know if it should look like that on purpose.Price is around $8 and up and they do have combos.Personally, I didn't think this place was that special. Just a good Comfort food place that's all.Recommend for a grub.

so i'm greek and every time i go here, i get yelled at for not coming in all the time.  honestly, when i want greek food, either i make it myself or i go to mom's house and just have to say, "ma, i'm hungry." and boom, there's a plate in front of me.that aside, this place is about as family style greek cooking as it gets.  it does taste like what i grew up eating.  the spanakopita is flaky, buttery and moist as it should be.  melts in your mouth.  the dolmathes are very rich and with a good splash of lemon juice taste great.  i havent been there in some time so i'm not sure if he's still serving falafel but when he did, damn it was good.  some of the best i've had, period.  but the gyros are where it's at.  i can only have one of these every so often or i think my heart may come to an arresting halt.  there's just a ton of lamb falling out of the pita and there is no sexy way to eat it so you end up looking like a bulldog eating a jar of mayonnaise.hit this place if your an ethnic foodie.  you wont be disappointed.  even when the owner yells at you for not coming in all the time.

It had fallen off my radar a bit, but I came for dinner earlier this week. Got the pasta with clams. Holy Moley! I've never seen so many tiny little clams! ($21 - See the photo!) Four in the shell and countless baby clams complimented by leeks and garlic.By the time I had finished the pasta, there was still a bed of clams on my plate! I got a to go container for the little buggers and figure I'll add them to some sauce and pasta at home for round 2!Entrees come with salad and bread.Salute means cheers and, lucky for us, they have some delicious wines to say it with!

Unless you've been here before, let me warn you about the "unspoken house rules": 1. Order first (do not try and sit down).2. Wait for your food while standing.3. Find a seat (if one is available).Under no circumstances should you sit down before placing an order. And if the place is full, don't try and sit down without food in your hands, unless you want to be made an example of.My wife and I (who frequent restaurants several times a week) have never experienced anyone quite as rude as the woman behind the counter at this place.  We had never been here before and when we walked in, my wife sat down at a table and I went up to place our order.Little did I know the house rules (see above) and after the people in front of me ordered, the obnoxious cashier pointed to our table and to another table (of newbies) and said to the person who just placed the order: "you can either sit there or there", with the tact of, say, General Patton. She never asked us to get up or explained the "unwritten rules" to us.  An "excuse me, but you need to order first before you sit down" would have sufficed.So, my wife got up and we walked out of this place. The food could very well be good - but with waitstaff like this woman - there are plentty of other places around town with not-so crummy service that I'd prefer to spend my money.The crepes served by this establishment might very well be the culinary embodiment of a mind-exploding, toe-curling, orgasm.  I say, "might be" because on my recent (and last) trip there I didn't have an opportunity to sample them.  In fact, I didn't eat anything at all.Please let me explain.The restaurant is located in the basement of a building off of Walnut Street.  Customers are expected to wait in a line that stretches from the entrance, through the main dining area, to a counter where the crepes are ordered and cooked.  It's a horrendous setup for multiple reasons.  First, there aren't many tables.  When I went there on a Saturday morning, there were at least 20 people standing in line for the ten or so small tables.  Second, the restaurant expects you to wait in line, standing next to tables of patrons who are eating their food, until a table becomes free.  At that point, the woman at the counter takes the next order, a man begins preparing the crepes, and the front of the line is seated while everyone else continues to wait.  Those who have waited long enough, are finally able to sit, while hungry and impatient diners-to-be stand next to their table and wait some more.It's a horrible atmosphere, and not one conducive to a pleasant dining experience.The dining space is poorly designed, so that the line of waiting patrons snakes directly though the middle of the cramped dining area.  Which means that when you are waiting, you are continually bumped by servers shuttling food to the tables and dirty dishes back to the kitchen.  When you are eating, you are likely to: 1) have a bunch of hungry people staring at you eat, waiting for you to leave your table, so that they may be seated; and/or 2) have a standing person's ass within a few inches of your head.  What a great dining atmosphere!What's all the more annoying is the lackadaisical work ethic of the people who prepare the crepes.  More than once during my wait, the man making the crepes just stood around, not making any food, waiting for another table to open, so a party's order could be taken, and he could then prepare the next order.  After waiting 15-20 minutes while hungry, becoming increasingly annoyed at being bumped at least 2 dozen times by serves traversing the line, and then seeing the owner stop making food until another order was taken, I said to myself, "enough of this nonsense".My party and I left to go to another restaurant.  I've not eaten any crepe in the world that would justify a long wait under such annoying circumstances, and I will not be back.

Review Text :
Super Dragon's main menu is filled with Americanized Chinese food which I ignored as soon as I saw the single page laminated menu in pure Chinese.  The two dishes we ordered were delicious and reminded me of food cooked at my grandma's house in Hong Kong.The Chinese menu is filled mainly with Cantonese food except for the obligatory Peking duck.  We ordered the bitter melon stir-fried with 3 kinds of diced eggs (salted duck eggs, preserved eggs and regular eggs).  The hints of bitterness nicely balanced the creaminess of the preserved eggs and savoriness of the salted eggs.The weather was cold so we wanted a braised dish served in a hotpot.  We ordered the mixed veg with dried shrimp and vermicelli (aka mung bean thread) in hotpot.  What came instead of the vermicelli was black moss and the addition of tofu, which was not mentioned.  We didn't mind because we really liked the dish esp the black moss which is a more expensive and rare ingredient.  The flavors were spot on, well-balanced and very comforting.I'm guessing that food from the Chinese menu is so rarely ordered that the kitchen confused what I ordered with another vegetarian dish on that menu.  I need to find out the name so that I can order it again.It's a shame that Super Dragon doesn't offer the authentic Chinese menu in English as well.My roommate and I live in this part of town, so we decided to eat here this evening. It's definitely a fabulous place to get some Chinese food.  The place has  a great family atmosphere, and the food is delectable. Portions are huge, so you get a good value for money especially the set lunch option. If you're not in the mood for going out, they also provide a delivery service. I'm giving them 5 stars because I'm a generous reviewer especially if the service is friendly, courteous, and fast.

Still trying to find my go-to noodle bowl place after visiting Yoshi's. This place looked dive-ish, but some of the best dishes come from places that look just like this. We went through the drive-thru around 8pm last Wednesday. The inside looked closed as the chairs were all stacked on the tables, but the drive-thru was buzzing. My friend and I both got the Yakisoba noodle bowl with chicken. I also ordered an order of Gyoza. Both bowls and Gyoza came to $11.00 with tax. Pretty decent prices I thought. We got back to my house, opened up the white wine, and camped out on the couch with our dinners. The sauce was pretty good- kind of a citrus soy. The noodles were good, even if average. Veggies and chicken were okay too. I guess the whole bowl was just okay. I was really craving the noodles and it shouldn't be hard to make good noodles at a Noodle place. The Gyoza were alright too- kind of crunchy around the edges. The sauce served with them were good though. All in all, not my dream dinner, but just okay. Would probably drive-thru again if I was in the area and didn't feel like cooking that night.

You gotta try Mim's Burger & Mexican Food for lunch if you haven't tried them already!  This is a little "hole in the wall" place located very close to the airport.  Catching an afternoon flight out to "BFE" from Sky Harbor the other day I decided to give Mim's Burger & Mexican Food a try. I was greeted by this very friendly man, the owner I believe, who was doing everything from taking orders to cooking and cleaning.  This place is bigger on the inside than what it looks like from the outside.  It's "dive-ee" inside too, but its clean and he has some really cool retro video games and a couple of pinball machines :^)I ordered a double cheese burger with a side of fries.  He fried the fries fresh and I watched him cook the burger.  Everything he makes is homemade and taste very good.  This is another one of those places "you can't judge a book by it's cover", so stop in see what's available inside.  Mim's is a great place for lunch if your on your way to/from the airport.  I'm looking forward to trying his fried fish or maybe even his BBQ brisket on my next visit!

This is the kind of restaurant that I deeply appreciate.  Family-owned.  Off the main roads.  Charming interior.  Unique staff.  WONDERFUL FOOD.  (We called this our "less-expensive Casbah" when we left).Like everywhere we end up going, we go because a Yelp review we have read, that inspired us to give it a try.  We new it was BYOB, but we weren't in the mood for drinking, so we walked on over.  It was our own fault that we got there, at 5:00pm, on the dot - and they were not quite ready to be opened, as they were finishing setting up the tables.  My boyfriend and I took a quick walk around Ellsworth.  It's a family-owned business where they turned their front garage into the most charming, artsy-like, romantic restaurant.  We'll cut them some slack!When we got back, they were ready for us; and we chose to snag a table outside (they thought we were nuts).  However, in one of the reviews, we read that they had no A/C, which was a big selling point for us (I absolutely loathe going into a freezing cold, A/C'd out restaurant, and being forced to bring a hoodie with me, when it's 90+ outside.  And we do kind of like hot, humid, and muggy); but, I guess they have upgraded because the A/C was BLASTING on the inside of the restaurant.We started off with the Gazpacho.  This was a perfect summer starter because it was cool, extremely flavorful, and a natural air conditioner to the body.  It had lumps of shrimp and crab meat at the bottom, which made us feel like we were eating somewhere on Duval St. in Key West.  I normally don't like cilantro, but the cilantro was so subtle and completely rounded out the flavor.  When our waitress brought out the freshly baked loaf of corn bread, we sopped up the rest of it.  It is true, the wait staff genuinely appreciates your compliments and feels honored every time you say you enjoyed something.I ordered the Wild Mushroom Ravioli and my boyfriend ordered the Lamb Burger.  When our dishes came out, they were the most beautiful dishes I had ever seen - full of color, wonderful portion sizing, and aromas just attacking the olfactory with sensational goodness.  My Ravs were topped with this grape tomato paquillo sauce, which tasted like it had hints of red pepper also.  It was FANTASTIC.  Plus, there were whole mushrooms, okra, carrots, and cauliflower on top of the dish as well.  I don't know what kind of separate seasonings were on the veggies, but they were to-die-for also.  I can't exactly remember how many Ravs were in my bowl, but every time I thought I was finished, there was another ravioli to be found, and then another.  For the price - I think there were a total of 10 fully-stuffed, hand-made mushroom ravs.  Incredible.My boyfriend's Lamb Burger came with a cranberry and raisin jam (but "jam" seems to cliché of a word for this topping), and a salad that had slices of apples in it.  Now I'm usually not one to eat sweeter tasting foods; however, the complementing of sweet and savory in this dish blew my mind.  I'm also not a big fruit eater (unless it's blended in a smoothie), but I totally got past all that because the flavors and the textures all are playing nicely with one another.We opted out of dessert because we were so stuffed.  But our bill for an appetizer and two filling, insanely delicious entrees came to $40.  DING DING DING DING DING!  WE HAVE FOUND A WINNER!  After dinner the owner came over to our table and we were introduced.  What a wonderful, sweet, and genuine older guy.  We will definitely be back before the menu changes again; and next time, we're going for entrees and dessert!! One last thing - it is a Cash Only restaurant, but they do have an ATM on-site.

Review Text :
Yep, another 5 star on my list of stuff here. So this was the place that I wanted to visit for my birthday dinner. My husband didn't complain, not one bit. That was part of the deal. I am pretty sure that he wasn't complaining, not because he wasn't allowed but because he really enjoyed the night! One of the first things that came out to the table was these Delicious little corn bread rolls with kudzu flower butter. You know, kudzu, that shit vine you cannot kill even by setting your yard on fire? Yeah, that plant. Well apparently the flower is really sweet and some genius decided to flavor some butter with it. NCDOT, here is your sign. So, rolls--check. Delish. Then, my drink came out. I guzzled my gin and tonic and became a wildly appropriately drunk. I mean, come on, it was my birthday--and the entire staff knew it. Dan ignored me during these first few intolerable moments, then he just gave up and enjoyed his dinner. I started off with this lobster puff pastry thing that was served with a side of saffron ice cream. Dan referred to it as the "lobster ice cream thing." He eye humped my food until I gave him a taste. Then he just stole it. It was that good. Dan had cold soup, which just that day, Michelle and I talked about how she wasn't a complete fan of cold soup, but to my surprise, Dan ate the whole bowl and wiped the bowl clean with the extra corn bread thing. We swapped plates because I wanted to have some too. I am sure the waiter was totally confused when he picked up the plates. He probably questioned himself the rest of the night wondering if he made a mistake in who was supposed to get what dish. I didn't tell or correct him. I let him wonder. I was drunk, please remember this was funny at the time. Then came my pork tenderloin with peach schnapps topping, collard greens and cornbread cakes. Wow. Not just good, fan-effing-tastic! Dan had the fillet. Fresh garlic and mushrooms. I had some of his too. It was effing delish too! Then, we had the "cleansing of the palate" raspberry sorbet. What a treat. I love ice cream if you haven't figured that out. I ate mine in little increments to make it last. Dan ate the whole thing in one bite. Then came the best part. Krispy Kreme bread pudding with Maker's Mark glaze, and it came to the table on FIRE! No candles needed here! I think it was about 27 dough-nuts packed into a little bread pudding upside down dish. Probably about 10,000 calories. But all worth it. I nearly licked the plate..rememeber, I was intoxicated. (and the fire had gone out by that time.)Dan had this chocolate banana puff pastry with rum ice cream. He didn't share with me. What a bastard. It looked good, and if it was any less than perfect he might have then shared it with me. So I guess his dessert was top notch. I would tell you how wonderful the bathrooms were or how pretty the soap was, or how clean the toilets were, however, I was wearing 6 inch heals that didn't really allow me to walk around that well, (again, insert intoxicated mentioning here...) I did however walk 7 blocks back to where we parked. Dan thought it would be nice to walk around after such a wonderful night. I would have let him carry me on his back, but my high cut dress would have shown off my goodies to everyone. And in my drunken state, I would have thought it was funny while Dan would be dying of shame in the corner. So I walked. Savannah Red was AWESOME!! Will most definitely return. I will use the valet service next time, and maybe get wildly INappropriate next time. Especially if I know that I don't have to walk far.I'm a bit embarrassed to admit that Savannah Red was actually an account of mine back when I used to sell wine, and I never actually knew what kind of food they served or what the inside of the restaurant even looked like. Since they were owned by the Marriott hotel that houses it, there wasn't much influence I could have over their wine list, and we already pretty much dominated it with some of our larger corporate profile wines. It's a shame really, because after dining there over the holidays I had a very good meal that would definitely warrant a second visit.Although the hotel was a bustle with energy after a recently ended football game (Meineke Car Care Bowl, or whatever the hell it's called now), the restaurant itself was virtually dead for dinner service on a Saturday night. This did give me a better chance to take in the surroundings, and notice the ornate chandelier (http://www.flickr.com/photos/wedoitforlove/4385725507/), along with a beautiful but non-functioning water display, and plates and silverware which seemed entirely too old-fashioned Southern elegant than necessary, including captain's chairs which didn't quite mesh with the tables. On the plus side, a virtually empty dining room caused service to be very attentive, and the food came out without delay.The chef decided to start out with an amuse bouche of crab stuffed pastry (http://www.flickr.com/photos/wedoitforlove/4386490332/) with a homemade remoulade sauce. It was interesting, because I honestly wasn't even expecting an amuse here, but it was a nice surprise. The remoulade was a bit weak (I tend to like a little more spice), but the crab was nice in texture and flavor. It didn't take me long after those 2 bites to dive right into the sweet cornbread biscuits, thanks to the very soft butter. The biscuits were delicious, and were it not for a huge food order coming, I could have easily downed a dozen right then.The first real course of the night was a lobster "cobbler", prepared as an étouffée inside a phyllo tart (http://www.flickr.com/photos/wedoitforlove/4385726467/), with a side of saffron ice cream and topped with fresh chive. This was very close to my favorite dish of the night. The lobster flavor was fantastic, and although the saffron ice cream seemed strange at this point in the meal it really paired well with the strong flavors of the main component. The phyllo was perfectly flaky and taken as a whole bite just melts in your mouth. The next starter, braised beef short ribs served over gingerbread cookies (http://www.flickr.com/photos/wedoitforlove/4386491172/) was a little more disappointing, but still decent. The sweetness of the cookies was too much, and didn't mix well with the soy in the beef glaze, but at least the meat was extremely tender.The soup course was next, and both options were frankly somewhat forgettable. The butternut squash soup (http://www.flickr.com/photos/wedoitforlove/4386491456/) was a bit bland, as it can often be, but usually chefs will do something the kick a little flavor in. Not so much here. But perhaps the biggest let down of the night was the pork belly stew (http://www.flickr.com/photos/wedoitforlove/4385727231/), which I had very high hopes for. It all became sort of a runny tomato mess, and the texture on the pork belly was very odd and somehow tough...almost like it had been in a freezer too long.After an intermezzo of chilled citrus sorbet, which acted as a wonderful palate cleanser, the main courses got them back on the road to redemption, both delivering solid flavors. The Scottish salmon (http://www.flickr.com/photos/wedoitforlove/4385727849/) was a very large portion, and cooked perfectly, flaking apart very nicely. The one downside was a general lack of seasoning in the dish, but at least the fish seemed pretty fresh so those flavors were enough to carry it as a whole. The duo of duck (http://www.flickr.com/photos/wedoitforlove/4385727613/), while looking a bit sloppy, was easily the best dish of the night, and something worth returning to Savannah Red to taste again. The breast portion was seared nicely, and very juicy, and the sauce on top really helped bring out the flavors of the meat as well as adding a hint of sweetness. The confit part was huge, as I would prefer it to be, and just fell apart under the fork, a really well cooked piece of meat.Since I've left Charlotte I'm a bit out of touch with the dining scene there, but it's nice to see good places like this still around, despite a very challenging location. Granted, most places would kill for the prime real estate downtown, but I have a feeling a lot of its presence is lost by the hotel towering above it, and a lobby that is completely distracting with all the other options. I love that they try to maintain some sense of Southern cuisine in their menu, and that every time I've checked the menu since dining there a year ago they are constantly updating it with new, fresh additions.Holy unprofessional, I wish they offered a free course called "server 101" because I fear our server cannot last in this industry much longer. I dare say she might have been the worst server I have ever experienced -and it actually blows my mind that she earns tips on a daily basis. She "greets" our table after 15 minutes of waiting in the lobby followed by 15 minutes of sitting at our table ...was the place slammed? No. Her greeting consisted of throwing her arms over the backs of our chairs and asking us if we'll buy her a shot of tequila.... then, when she took our order and her pen didn't work she turned around and threw it at the bar...nice.  She dropped two of our meals (a filet and salmon) and then came over and said "you heard that crash, that was your meal" ...I then politely told her that my rare steak looked more well and she then answered " well that's three people that have to wait for their meals...rolled her eyes and stormed off" ...nice.She then brings out the salmon...gosh that poor friend who ordered salmon. The first time it was served raw. Then she had to send it back yet again- the third time it was served without sauce. They finally just brought her out her sides to eat while she waiting for her dish since this was going on a 2. 5 hour meal at this point....nice. Everyone paid the full cost of their meal which was fine for me as steak is over/under cooked quite frequently but there really was no excuse for the salmon at that point - 3 times you blew it. To make matters worse our server tacked on her 20% at the end - of course, that's why her service sucked (to be frank), she knew all along she would be tipped- why try? Oh and at the end she exclaimed that in 20 minutes she would be drinking tequila, I had only hoped she saved enough for me...lord knows I needed it at that point!I will say the only reason I gave it two stars instead of one was that the manager brought me a complimentary dessert and glass of sparkling wine, for she seemed to be the only professional who cared about her guests and how they were treated. I know that problems with the meals are often not the fault of a server, but to be friendly, helpful, and in general apologetic ...or even sympathetic to your guests, well that is the job of the server, and she failed miserably.Disappointed is an understatement . I will not be back.

Review Text :
Usually when I visit my family in Phoenix it takes what seems like a lifetime to find a place to eat that is not the tried, true, and tired.  Eating at this modest restaurant was the culinary highlight of my trip to Phoenix.  I implore all Phoenicians to frequent this establishment and your taste buds will thank you.For starters, the chips were wonderfully light and not too oily.  The chips come with two different types of salsa.  A red salsa with a little bit of a bite and a green avocado salsa that is mild with just the right hint of avocado. I ordered the shrimp in garlic sauce and the dish was sublime.  The shrimp were sauteed with red bell peppers and onions.  The vegetables were cooked perfectly - not too soft and not too crunchy.  The garlic sauce was wonderfully sweet and garlicky.  I couldn't get enough of it.My dining companions both ordered the Camarones Culichi.  This dish is freaking amazing!  It consists of shrimp cooked in a green tomatillo sauce and loaded with melted Manchego cheese.  The sauce is divine and words cannot describe it properly.  The perfect accompaniments to these dishes were Mexican Coca-Colas (Yay!), creamy beans topped with cheese, and white rice with vegetables.  The tortillas were right on and looked to be homemade.Leave behind the comfort of the fancy pants restaurants that the trendinistas like to go to and try something real.  You will not be sorry.I've been coming here for YEARS and just thought to review it?  WTF is wrong with me???????????????????????THIS is Mexican seafood.  I've been to other places and nothing compares!  I take a book, sit in back and people watch while creaming my "Make Me Yelp" panties as I eat my culichi.  It's D I V I N E!  Eat the shrimp with a fork but you sure as Hell better use a spoon to destroy the rest of the bowl and leave it clean!Everything is fresh and the wait staff is loaded with recommendations.  Ask, and ye shall find. The snapper Veracruz is so good I often order 2 and take one home.  The decor is fun - aquatic scenes that won't make you feel guilty for eating the seafood in front of you.  At Xmas they had a Santa at the door!  The people here a super-friendly!  They have their own parking lot.  You know it's a good place when yours isn't the fanciest car in the parking lot.  All kinds come here, despite the neighborhood not being the nicest in DoPho.  You can't miss it - even though I do pass it every time!  I think I'm too excited thinking of the shrimp culichi and my mouth is watering so much that I always manage to say "Crap, passed it again!"Go.  Just go to this place.  You won't be disappointed.  I swear.  And, you won't break the bank.Here in Phoenix I think that we are pretty lucky to have such diversity in each neighborhood. Particularly South Phoenix where you can find great Soul Food at Lolo's Chicken and Waffles, Pizza at Amano, and of course various different types and regions of Mexican food. When I say Mexican food I'm really referring to the sort of hole in the wall, real deal family owned operations that are all over the south side of Phoenix. So many of them dot each street corner and call like the Sirens of the night. Marisco's Playa Hermosa is exactly what I mean by this."We bring the sea to the desert" is their slogan and it's so true. Stepping inside you'll feel like you were just transported to Mazatlán, Mexico, the only things missing here is the ocean. The place is just splashed with bright colors with hand carved tables and birds with a welcoming and friendly staff. With so much to take in it's hard to focus on any one thing, though with so many bird carvings hanging from the ceiling I almost felt like I was in the Tiki Room at Disneyland, less the chatter of the birds of course. Chips and salsa at a Mexican restaurant can be a very good benchmark to judge the rest of your meal, Marisco's would have to be at the top of these tests. Their chips are slightly thick, warm and a little on the oily side, this way the salt can adhere well to them. Accompanying are 2 different salsa, red and green. The red has a certain sweet and hot bitterness that is tasty and even better when washed down with a cold beer. The green is made of creamy avocado and with a warm chip is absolutely delicious. Neither were very hot but that's the thing with real deal Mexican food, its not always hot and spicy. So you'll have no reason to expect the "burning ring of fire" the next day! With so many different and tasty sounding items to choose from, deciding was pretty tough as I really enjoy some good seafood. So imagine this, 8 large perfectly cooked shrimp, swimming in a creamy tomatillo and cilantro sauce, then topped with a sprinkling of cheese. If this sounds like something you would enjoy then go ahead and order the Camarones Culichi ($13.99). You will also get a basket of hot fresh corn or flour tortillas for dunking as well as rice, beans and a fresh lettuce salad dressed with lime juice. The beans have a nice texture with good flavor but the rice is nice! Well steamed and seasoned, the rice has a bright white color which might look bland, but after one bite you'll be wrapping it up in a hot tortilla and dunking it into the beans. The Mojarra Frita ($15), a fried whole fried fish, sounds and looks good, but decided to be more like a daddy's little girl and order something less involved. Crab Enchilada's ($13) are not only the house specialty but are good to the last bite. 3 corn tortillas over stuffed with sweet crab meat, rolled together with cheese and covered in a slightly spicy red sauce. Again with the rice, beans and salad this is a pretty large plate and for the money, a great value. The enchiladas were actually featured in Gourmet Magazine at one time, who knew?On the back of the menu you'll find a section called Camida Mexicana which are plates of regular Mexican fare such as burritos, taco's and fajitas. Not trying the Carne Asada Taco's ($6.99) would be a real shame since the meat is so tender and the flavor so beefy. A plate full of 3 tacos, double tortilla, chopped beef and onions, with rice and beans is both satisfying and ample. Douse the tacos with some of the guacamole salsa and you'll have a party on your plate! The Quesadilla ($7.99) is just cheese and a tortilla, while good it was quite ordinary. However the smell from the Fajitas De Pollo ($10.99) was amazing! I'll have those to myself next time!For dessert you can stick with maybe a Mexican Coke ($2) made with real sugar or a large glass of over ice Horchata ($2.50). Though for something more, the Flan ($4) was different than what you normally get. More cake like and dense than silky smooth, it was decent enough and a nice finish to so many savory dishes. Otherwise there aren't any other desserts offers, like you'll have room after such good sized portions anyway. Marisco's Playa Hermosa is a real gem and has the menu, friendliness and comfortable vibe to back it up. While the neighborhood feels a bit on the seedy side, as they say, nothing ventured, nothing gained?BEST MEXICAN FOOD EVER.Do not even look at the menu, people. Just order a Dos Equis and the Molcajete Caliente with verde sauce. My boyfriend and I found this place on the Yelp app, like most eateries we visited while in Phoenix. I cannot express how happy this place made us. We loved the restaurant, the service and the food so much that we actually came back and ate there again before heading to the airport.The Molcajete Caliente is $22 for two people. You each get your own ceviche tostada and plate of rice, beans and salad (all delicious). They also bring a warmer with corn or flour tortillas. But the main event... a volcanic-like cast iron cauldron (a molcajete) teeming with bubbling green sauce with various kinds of grilled meats and seafood hanging around the outside. The smell alone will bring you halfway to heaven, but ZOMG, taste explosion! SO GOOD. It comes with two breaded fish filets, two pieces of grilled steak, two of chicken and four big shrimp. Plus, there are little chunks of octopus in the sauce itself. If I had to choose a favorite, it would be the fish (or the seafood in general), but every bite of everything was honestly amazing. It may be the best sauce I've ever eaten. The service was superb both visits---super friendly, fast and helpful. The server was the one who recommended the molcajete in the first place, actually. The prices are almost unbelievable ($22 for a VOLCANO OF FOOD??). The restaurant itself is really clean and full ceramic tiles and colorful artwork. Some reviewers have commented about the dodgy location. The neighborhood seemed fine to me, though I don't live in Phoenix so I could be mistaken. It's mostly residential, but well-worth making a special trip (like, every single day) for this food!Note: If you're planning on ordering the ceviche as an appetizer, just be aware that you might not get your house ceviche tostadas. We didn't get ours the second visit because my boyfriend insisted on getting a full order of ceviche. He was hoping they would bring both (because he's insane and would eat an ocean full of ceviche if left on his own), but they didn't.On a recent vacation to Mexico, my mom asked Jared and I where the best Mexican food in Phoenix was... This place immediately came to mind for us both!When you walk into the door of Mariscos Playa Hermosa, you feel like you very well may be in Mexico.  It feels extremely authentic, with a festive atmosphere, a staff that doesn't speak too much English, and food that is delicioso!  It's nothing like the Americanized Mexican / Latin places  you've been to before. Don't load up on the chips and salsa as the portions are big and you'll want to save room for what is to come.  Their house iced tea is very good if you want something other than a cold cerveza.As Annie D said in her review, I highly recommend going with the Molcajete Caliente with verde sauce. You can't go wrong with that!  I ordered something else and ate off of Jared's Molcajete Caliente along with my own.  That sauce is incredible!Note that this place closes early during the week.  We met some friends there at 7pm and at 8:20 we were the last ones in there and we could tell the staff was ready to go home.  I can't wait to return to this local gem of a restauran for another memorable meal very soon.What a fantastic meal I had.  I've been desiring amazing Mexican restaurants in Arizona.  Since I moved here, I've been to several places that were underwhelming, at best, and generally just not good to me.  So, I'd given up on Mexican Food in AZ and I just didn't eat any.  Well, a conversation in Yelp Talk about Mexican Food inspired me to check out some different places and this one turned up in my searches on Yelp and other websites.I'm happy to say that I was so thrilled and enjoyed my meal very much at Mariscos Playa Hermosa.  Again, another hole-in-the-wall, but still quite the find.  Mariscos is located in a pretty seedy part of town, so don't get nervous going there.  They close early, so you'd better arrive early.  You will find that there is a full bar inside this colorfully decorated resto.  Don't eat at the bar.  That things not suitable for anything except decoration as the bar itself doesn't extend out far enough to make it comfortable to sit there.  (this is a tip from a person who opted to sit at the bar)I tasted a few items off the menu.  The shrimp in diablo sauce was my favorite.  I ordered extra diablo sauce on the side.   The sauce has a smokey taste with the heat of the peppers.  Perfect for my heat seeking taste buds.  They prepare the sauce "fresh to order".So there is a charge for $3 for the extra sauce on the side to go.  I used that sauce to make more shrimp diablo at home later that week.  I also enjoyed the camarones culichi... shrimp in green sauce.  Culichi is a tomatillio sauce made with some dairy product and cilantro and of course the poblano or tomatillio peppers.  The sauce is simply to die for.  I left there satisfied and happy!  I will return and take a friend for the Molcajete Caliente with verde sauce.  Can't wait.  I'm sure it will please.They have a check-in offer too, so be sure to check-in.Oh, that parking lot is TINY.  Be aware of that when you go.Mariscos Playa Hermosa was picked for May's International Supper Club UYE and we had a big turnout expected 14 but had around 26 to 30 and I have to say management & servers didn't blink an eye when I kept asking for another chair please.  Excellent customer service!  The parking lot is very very small, maybe can park 8 to 12 cars, but there is plenty of parking on the street, so that what I did, once inside the place is very colorful and inviting.I ordered the 3 carne asada tacos with beans and rice. They were great street tacos perfect for what I was craving. The beans and rice were ok, over all it was a good dish and with tax included came in under 10 bucks! That's a great deal for dinner!  After everyone was done eating they brought us out 5 different types of cakes/dessert to try, chocolate cake, tres leches cake, coconut cake, cheese cake & flan. I'm a chocolate lovin fool and the chocolate cake was perfect, it was sweet, rich and full of chocolaty goodness, but my favorite I have to say was the Tres Leches Cake, that stuff was amazing! Also the coconut cake was great too! I defiantly will be coming back to try a few other of their dishes for sure!

Review Text :
I have to say I really loved this place.  I love the mesh of old and new.  I love a greasy spoon.  Most of all, I love the fact that I can visit here any time of the day.I have heard of Tom's for a very long time.  I remember there being a Tom's in the South Side and visiting it many times, but this spot is so different.  There's a different vibe here, more laid back, less bustle.  Walking in here makes you feel as if you are entering a tiny road stop diner, you kind of forget that you are still within the Pittsburgh region, especially if you stop here in the wee hours of the morning.I grabbed a booth to myself and within a minute the waitress was there to hand me a menu and ask me what I wanted to drink.  Looking over the menu took me some time seeing how this was my first visit here.  I ended up ordering a BLT with a side of loaded fries.  While waiting for my food to arrive I looked around the place and took it all in.  The colors, decor, and furniture definitely give you that diner vibe.  When I think of a diner I think of the shiny chrome, the bright white and red checkered pattern and bar stools at a counter.  All of that is here!My food finally arrived and I started to dive into it.  The first thing that popped into my head was, "why did I order a side of fries?"  The BLT comes with a decent side portion of fries to begin with, I really didn't need more fries.  The BLT itself was perfect.  The bacon was greasy, yet crisp, the lettuce was refreshing and the tomato was just the right thickness.  Add a little mayo to the toasted bread and we are in business.  It was so good I wish I had just ordered two BLTs.  The loaded fries were pretty good as well.  Topped with cheese sauce and bacon (man, I just couldn't get enough of that bacon).The waitress on duty was super polite and very attentive.  Even though it was very early in the morning, she did not miss a beat or sit around.  The only gripe I have about this place is the prices.  Some of them need to be readjusted, but other than that, it's a stellar place to get a meal.**something to note: they do serve alcohol here.Tom's Diner is what you expect of diner food, cheap and filling.  The help isn't crazy fast but pleasant enough, and the kitchen is open.  They also have some unique selections, which makes them good in my book!The day I came in, I just wanted an omelette.  I think it was $7 or so, and it came with toast and potatoes!  The omelette was packed full of peppers, meat, cheese, and tomatoes.  There were plenty of toast options as well.  I wouldn't go out of my way to come here, but it is delicious all the same.There is a very small free parking lot behind the building for customers.

I am happy to report that after some quality hitches that I mentioned in my last review, Long Wong's is back to good!!  I've been in several times since my last review and each time the pizza and Pepsi were perfect and the wings were amazeballs.  Seems they took note of the issues and corrected them, good on them!If you haven't had Long Wongs wings then you really should try them.  In my humble opinion they beat all the other wing places, hands down.

So I went to a late lunch with the Moms this weekend. (One plopped me out and the other is her BFF that's been around long before I was doing boom-boom and creating crayon masterpieces on the wall.) They wanted salads somewhere downtown. And all the places I've never been to but have been wanting to go to for ages were either closed or greens free-- LoLo's (collard don't count), Palatte, Cheuvront, Cibo, My Florist, and so on.So Moms decided that Coach and Willie's was the perfect luncheon destination.(Cuz they thought the salads online looked purdy tasty, and they were right. But I shouldn't have "judged a book by its cover," since even McDonald's looks pretty good in commercials.)So I swing by to pick up my sis and we dash to Coach and Willie's. I thought the name sounded like a bastard love filly to a Pony Express stud. Or maybe some purebred dog name, like Sir Charles McWigglesworth.Easy to find. Parking was plentiful. Patio was neato. Sunken bar seemed like a novelty. Horseshoe shaped booths were comfy and inviting. Atmosphere was upscaley for a sports bar. Company was vivacious. Waitress was engaging and attentive. Bacon wrapped prawns were succulent and satisfying. My Woodchuck cider was tasting crisp and peary. And I had a big ole smile on my face.It was salad time. Now if a salad costs ten dollars, I expect more than a tasteless expanse of iceburg lettuce. What head chef uses iceburg lettuce any more? With all the varieties of salad greens to chose from, I end up with the tasteless, tacky trailer trash of the field greens world? I'm not saying you gotta get all pretentious with a salad by using micro greens grown in an organic hot house, but for fuck sake, iceburg? Airplanes and cafeterias are the only places I've ever encountered iceburg not in fancy pants wedge salad form, which classes it up some and acknowledges the fact that iceburg is tasteless filler devoid of nutrients of any sort.Is Coach and Willie's food comparable to airplane fare? Ahem, yes. My salad was anyway. Everyone else seemed to enjoy theirs, despite the offensive iceburg. I just ate the equally tasteless southwestern chicken mass that came on top and picked around the lettuce filler. So while the lunch was fun and the bacon wrapped prawns were rockin', the salad sucked. And since I've only been here once, they get a less than stellar review. (And I'm stating that straight up so nobody gets all persnickety. I've only been once. For lunch. And a crap salad.)I'm sure it's a fun place for drinks before a game or for a quick lunch with coworkers, but I'm taking a stand against iceburg lettuce. It should be eliminated on principle alone. (Aside from its uses as filler; see Navajo tacos and garnish.)Anybody want to join my one woman campaign?Came here for dinner with Scott after a wonderful baseball game.  Its right around the corner from Chase Field, and neither of us had been here before.  We had an excellent time together at Coach and Willies, but I think we both left with a feeling of something to be desired by this place.  Here's my take on the place:I dont think this place is bad.  I just think its not the greatest.  Scott and I did enjoy our time here, BUT, I think we both found the same things annoying about it.First, I feel like theres a conflict of decorating.  I feel like theres two completely different themes going on here, and they both clash with one another.  Part of it seems like it wants to be a nicer resturant....the other part wants to be a sports bar.  Neither one compliments each other.  When you walk in, theres a great patio area for dining.  Loved it!  But, then when you walk in, and kind of walk around, it shows signs of trying to be a sports bar.  The bar itself is set really low.  Lower then the tables themselves.  Heavy marble looking bar tops, with chairs.  At one point Scott and I counted 15 (YES 15!) flat screen TVs!  I will say, there was one particular TV in our area that I noticed that had amazing reception.  It was probably one of the better flat screens I have seen!  To my benefit, I ordered the half nachos.  The server ended up bringing me out a full plate of nachos (bonus!) and I was happy!  Food here is so so.  I feel like this place is a place I would probably bring my parents to, but it really didnt blow me away.I went to @coachnwillies last night, as part of the @downtownphoenix spring fling pub crawl.Coach & Willies is the reason negative ratings should be possible on @yelp.I will never, ever return.When we arrived, we ordered a beer, and a soda.We also ordered nachos. They were piled high. This is a good thing.Removing the first couple chips resulted in a couple olives falling on to the bar. I wiped them into a pile, but figured I'd wait until I was done, to catch anything else, and clean it up.A few of us decided to have a shot, to celebrate a birthday-in-progress. I flagged one of the bartenders down.He approaches me and says "Are you gonna stop making a mess on my bar?"Me: "Excuse me?"BT: "You're making a mess"Me: "I would like to order a drink, not get hassled"BT: "I don't care about your drinks, I only care about your tips"Me: "Well you're not exactly working for one at the moment"BT: "Are you going to order or not?"I placed my order without any further comments, lest I inform him of my true feelings.He takes my credit card and asks if I'd like to keep it open. I tell him no, because I have left my card in the past.He returns with the receipt. On the "tip" line I write "NoFuckingWay!"I work in a service industry. You don't treat me like shit and still get a tip. Fuck you.A while later I go to order a beer. This same motherfucker tells me I'm cut off.Yes, I am cut off.I have had maybe three beers, and a shot, in 5 hours.I ask another bartender, and as he is about to pour me a beer, the first SOB hollers to him that I am cut off, then proceeds to show him my receipt.Because, apparently, you not giving a tip is justification for him being a cocksucker.I demand to see a manager, and one comes over. I tell him that the guy is cutting me off because I refused to tip him, and he tells me that the problem is that there is a $10 minimum on CC transactions.Curiously, that isn't stated anywhere. Further, this "manager" took my first beer order, when I arrived, and made no mention of the minimum when I bought just the one beer, nor did the other bartender mention that when I paid for the shots, which actually totaled $24.This "manager" was gracious enough to let me pay their establishment for service again. /sarcasmI will recommend to every single person I know to never patronize that establishment, and I will never return to a place with such puerile and petty employees.I booked my birthday party here, mostly because of it's close proximity to The Duce. I was in contact with someone who said she was the Manager, Daron Harvey. She was great and said she would extend happy hour for my party. However, upon arrival, the night of my party, the manager on duty had no idea my party was coming. When I told him that I had spoken to a manager about having my party there and he snidely remarked, "that's weird, I'm the manager." Wow, way to be nice about the amount of business I am about to bring your bar. To top it off, we got there at 9pm, which is what I told the Manager I was e-mailing, just to find out they normally close at 10pm on non-Suns game nights, unless they have 20+ people. So, now I feel awkward 'cause we're keeping these servers past the time that they probably thought they were going home. The only reason I am not giving them one star is that they were still able to accommodate my party and give us the specials. Except after 1.5 hours of being there, the server asks me if we're all on separate checks. I don't understand how you just assume these things and we had to wait a bit longer to get our tabs. Lastly, I get the rule to add gratuity for such a big party, but the gratuity added was 22%. Random. Such a terrible experience.

What do you do Sunday morning when you do not want any eggs or serial for breakfast? Well, we go to IHOP! And so we did this Sunday. Its 8:30am, there are ton of free tables and we get seated right away. Ohh wait! Its our server's 1st day!! OMG Horror! But, hey, you know what - kid was great! He did all just right and did not screwed up once! Kudos to you David! So, anyhow. Pancakes were good. Coffee was warm and OJ was fresh. There were no hairs in my plate nor weird stains on my spoon. What else can anyone expect from IHOP? 4 stars! If you wanna huge portion of pancakes go to IHOP, they got that!"I like"

I am really quite surprised at the high reviews for this establishment. They truly don't deserve it! I purchased a coupon for this restaurant through my work (after checking the Yelp reviews, of course) so we were excited to give them a try but were sorely let down.When we arrived the first thing I noticed was the place was empty at 6pm. Well that's not a good sign! We waited for one of the employees to acknowledge us between their laughter and chatter between each other. Once being taken to our table we looked at the menu and couldn't believe the prices; they were extremely high. I told my boyfriend, its a good thing we have a coupon, this better be some dang good Italian food! Due to the high prices, we decided to share an appetizer and an entree, surely it would be plenty, it's an Italian restaurant! It took about 25 minutes for our appetizer of meatballs to arrive and when it did my boyfriend and I just looked at each other. There were about 6 tiny meatballs swimming in some marinara. I was expecting huge meatballs like what you get at Oregano's...nope, not even close! So we ate, and unfortunately the dish was nothing special. They tasted like they were from a frozen bag. As we were waiting for our entree I had been needing more water but regardless of the empty restaurant no one was checking on us. We waited for our entree another 20 minutes after that. Why was it taking so long? We were the only ones in the dining room. We finally received our entree. What the hell! It was just about the same size as our appetizer!!! There were three small rolls of pasta. Seriously? Did someone eat the other 3/4 of it back in the kitchen? We ate those in about literally a minute and then tried to scarf down some bread to help fill our stomachs. And the worst part, it wasn't that good. At this point I finally was given more water. Needless to say we would never come back here. Why pay such ridiculous prices for tiny portions of pretentious food with a side of crappy service? No thanks, I'll head over to Oregano's or RigaTonys!

4.5 stars... Minus a 1/2 star for the fact that I only experienced take-out and the fact that the kreplach in my soup didn't taste right.  Other than that, this is my new favorite place to get matzo ball soup.  The broth tasted just as good if not better than any I've had before.  The combination of vegetables, dill, seasoning, and fresh chicken soothed my sore throat instantly and warmed me up too!The menu is HUGE and the cases full of knishes, bagels, rugalach, muffins, smoked fish and more were impressive for the valley.  I noted that they have a section on the menu called "On The Liter Side" for those that are calorie or carb conscious.  I also noticed that they'll make egg white omelettes upon request (and for an additional $1).I'll have to return to Scott's Generations when I'm feeling better and my appetite is back to normal.  Hopefully that will be soon thanks to the soup I enjoyed today!Christmas really isn't my holiday...it's more for the Beautiful Carin, and I try my very best to play along and do what I should to make the holiday "joyful"...not my strong suit:)This Christmas is no different than 30 or 40 others that preceded it...it's the end of the year and that always bring its own peculiar brand of "troubles".Today, I had to visit with one of my attorney's (I know, pathetic)...some trouble with some partners in a business relationship and I am trying to figure out what the best course of action is...this attorney is my Doberman...he will chase people to the bowels of hell and bring them back screaming to be returned to Satan's loving grasp...if the compensation is right:)I don't Yelp him, because frankly, he scares me...a little bit:)I was bemoaning the holiday season to him during our session today (believe it or not our "chit chat" is quite brief at $425 per hour), and his legal advice was that I "sack up" and get over it:)To reinforce that, he took me to lunch (I must look like I'm going to be a gold mine to him!) at Scott's Generations:)That did indeed put a smile on my face and prepared me adequately for my next meeting this afternoon.I love deli...I get to NYC 2-3 times a year, and consequently I don't think very much of the deli's here in town...overpriced, under-sized...less than we should expect:(Even Goldman's, who's been good for several years, has fallen sharply over the past year.Scott's could change my perception of the deli landscape in PHX.I had a hot corned beef on rye that was as tasty as anything I've found in Phoenix...and it was huge...a restricted flight softball of hot, moist corned beef, between two thick slices of rye (from Karshes, next door, with plenty of caraway seeds:)Four salt brine pickle spears, and cole slaw, accompanied this behemoth:)I couldn't leave well enough alone and ordered a side of crinkle cut fries to "make the season bright":)$11.00 US money for the whole deal (no extra charge for "extra lean":)Everything was well made, tasty and nicely presented by the sweet ladies that serve the all the customers...I mean 20-25% tip service by these sweethearts:)I waddled out, with my mood adjusted back to "non-grinchy" (I'm sure this lunch will appear on the bill from my attorney, at some point...I just choose not to think about it right now:)I didn't even have room for a Black and White cookie from Karshes, after lunch...that's packing in the corned beef!While Scott's Generations is not, strictly (or even un-strictly) speaking "kosher", it is definitely in  the traditional "New York Style":)No, I would not claim it's as good as anything in Manhattan...but I gotta tell you, it's as good as a lot of neighborhood deli's in Manhattan...and easily the best of breed for PHX.How did I not know this existed?  It's within walking distance from home!Went with Chrissy P for a New Year's Day brunch.  It's so freaking hard to find a good NY-style deli up in here!Got there before her, so I grabbed a take-out menu.  Holy lox, Batman (I usually say "Holy frijoles, but it's a Jewish deli, get it??) the menu is HUGE!They have a full breakfast menu with omelets, Jewish staples like lox, blintzes and matzo brie.  There are huevos rancheros, skillet dishes to round out the breakfasts.Many different smoked fish dishes, too.  I had the egg salad sandwich on wheat bread.  *Real* wheat bread.  Though I think the egg salad was missing something, it was still delicious.  Also got a side of fries.  They were homemade crinkle-cut, with the skins still on them!  I love fries with the skin still there.  Service was ultra-friendly and we never had to ask for a refill on our drinks.I will definitely be back.  It will take forever to get through the menu, even for a pescatarian like me.I get into these wild food moods where Ill wake up and have a craving for something, its usually pretty specific, this particular morning it was corned beef. Sounds crazy but once I get it in my head I wont be satisfied until I give into my cravings. I wasn't hungry though for just any corned beef, it had to be Boar's Head brand, aside from a few grocery stores the only place you can get Boar's Head is a good delicatessen. I knew just where to go, Scott's!Situated between an Ace Hardware and a Basha's, this seems hardly the spot for a tasty sandwich. Let me tell you, they serve up massive tasty sandwiches with thick piled meat on your choice of bread and they have choices. Feeling helpless and at complete mercy to my urges I ordered Scott's Perfect Reuben-Reuben ($11.50). So tall you cant get your mouth around it, its stuffed with corned beef, swiss cheese and sauerkraut then grilled to a crispy buttery goodness.When the server set my sandwich in front of me my eyes widened, it was a thing of beauty and desire. As I managed my sandwich for the first bite, I felt the wafts of hot corned beef beckoning, eat me, eat me. Enjoying bite after satisfying bite, my morning craving was quickly becoming fulfilled like an ancient prophecy. Ordering a side of Russian dressing to dunk my fries into may sound slightly odd but after one dip I think you'll agree, its perfectly natural.For the health conscious who are rolling their eyes at my delicious choices, Scott's does offer lighter fare such as salads, soup and half sandwiches. However, I for one don't go to Scott's to eat light, I go to Scott's eat well.Scott's Generations is hands down the best east coast-style deli in the valley, particularly for breakfast. It's just as cheap as Denny's down the street and about ten times more satisfying and wholesome. Their baked goods and bagels are crisp, chewy perfection. No perpetrating steam oven biscuit bagels here like Breuggers or Einsteins.  And there's plenty of cream cheese options to schmear to your heart's content. I'm usually a pretty flexible diner, rotating through a menu to try new things, but here I get one thing and one thing only every time. Brandi's Breakfast Special for only four bucks: two eggs over easy, home fries and a garlic bagel with chive cream cheese.I guarantee that meal will sink like a satisfying rock to the bottom of your stomach and keep you full for hours. With coffee and tip the whole thing will set you back about eight bucks.Enjoy the surly granny wait staff that'll call you doll or sugar, and treat yourself to a black and white cookie on the way out. Trust me.I think this can give the Jewish delis of NYC a run for their money. The place itself is clean and spacious, and the comfortable booths were just right for the mini-UYE with Rand H., Mike C., and Robyn N. I ordered a half pastrami sandwich and a bowl of kreplach soup; these came with sides of coleslaw and pickle spears. A plate of bagel chips was also served with the soup. The pastrami sandwich was superb and overstuffed like it should be; really tasty - I thought I should have ordered a whole sandwich instead of a half. The kreplach was good; tasty and hearty, and a bowl could have been a meal. I really have to come back here to try other stuff, such as belly lox ... but return visits won't be too frequent for me, only because the food is quite pricey. The half sandwich, bowl of soup, and coffee cost close to 15 bucks.A Jewish girl walks into a (oh, wait, I am writing a restaurant review and not a J.A.P. joke)....When Scott's first opened many years ago, it was really good and had a lot more competition than it does now. In those days, there was Katz Deli, several Miracle Mile locations, Chompie's and a few other ill fated places (anyone remember Hollywood Deli?). I currently live in one of the best food meccas of the West Coast and can't get really good Jewish deli (Saul's is not great folks, and no, I have not tried Miller's yet). When Mom and Grandma picked me up from the airport, I had suggested we stop at Scott's to give them a try on the way to Sun City. None of us had been there in several years and I was really excited at a prospect for a delicious hot pastrami sandwich on rye. We got there, walked in and I noticed that the place itself looked a bit run down and dare I say, a little dirty? The owners are the same but the guy behind the counter who used to be friendly and Hamish just sat there like a schlub. We were directed to a table, and I immediately noticed how large their menu was. I ordered my sandwich sadly assuming that my regular hot pastrami would be (a) HOT and (b) on Karsh's rye since Karsh's is right next door. Neither was the case when my sandwich arrived and the pastrami was not delicious and I asked the waitress if I was mistakenly given the "lean" type of pastrami and she said I was not. Mom had a tongue sandwich and thought it was "okay" but she is not as picky (bitchy) as I am and Grandma had blintzes which did not look homemade but that of the frozen variety (I hope I am wrong here). Service was fair. Not warm and not quite the NY attitude that passes in these types of establishments.After our experience I will no longer suggest Scott's and will have them drive directly to Chompie's.A prompt, attentive service, and good Jewish deli will have me returning soon.I discovered this place when I went to get something at Ace Hardware.I noticed that they served breakfast all day, so I went inside the restaurant.I was seated right away and within minutes, I was given a glass of water.My server was friendly and accommodating.I was in a hurry, and without carefully looking at the menu, I decided to order the vegetarian skillet.It was okay, but I wish I had ordered something else.I do not like potatoes and onions in my omelet skillet.The restaurant is welcoming, and the walls are full of wedding and family pictures. It looks like it's a family owned and operated business. That's very nice and special.I will go back and try something else, but next time I will read the menu.Omg. MOLD, mold everywhere!!!! I bought two potato filled pastry's we get 3/4 through eating them and my boyfriend goes "Is that mold" we then pick the pastry shell apart and the entire thing is filled with thick black mold. This was hours after they were purchased! In about an hour we were both feeling sick, I threw up which was terrible. I'm posting a picture of the nasty moldy food we got. I'm shocked. I eat out everyday and have NEVER EVER had an experience like this. I ordered Borsch off the menu as well, and they were out so he just opened a can they had on the shelf and added tap water (for $8.95) I have to say one word...HORRIFIED!Pastrami, pastrami, pastrami, pastrami, pastrami, pastrami." on rye...that's the way I judge a dood Deli, by their Pastrami Sandwhich. Well this isn't up there with Chompies (portin wise) but it sure was close. The pastrami sandwich was surprisingly good. I prefer thick, hand-carved pastrami, "The pastrami was a perfect mix of lean and fatty portions and  and freshly carved. Definitely better than your ordinary pastrami. The pastrami here is to die for. Never in my life I imagined that pastrami, or any kind of meat for that matter, can be so succulent and juicy. It literally melts in your mouth. I got their Pastrami Sandwhich, my wife got their reuben. To go we got 6 bagels, lox spread, chopped liver, herring in sour cream sauce and some pickels.  What's good here, the answer is everything As for the desserts ... The massive slabs of Cheeese Cake was moist and ridiculously good (and ridiculously big)FOOD:  Unbelievably lean and tasty. I thoroughly enjoyed every bite of my sandwich. oh and their pickles..... don't even get me STARTED they were  exactly how grandma used to make them and the pickles just topped it off. PRICE: Although the prices are a bit high you will definitely have leftovers for lunch the next day. CONCLUSION:  The portions sizes are very generous,  especially for the price! I highly recommend giving this place a try!

I had the boofay yesterday with Ryan C. It was good. I liked being able to try it all and figure out what I do not like. There was nothing that was really bad, and nothing that was really great. It was all good. The coconut chicken soup thing was a little odd, but the chicken in it was really good quality and tasted good while added to other types of sauce. OH YEAH... They painted and re decorated. It looks really good in there.After a few parties left and we were the only ones in the place, we were just like the family from A Christmas Story christmas afternoon, although no one sang us a rousing chorus of "Deck The Harrs" like they got in the movie! We got several dishes to share family style.  Menu items more than hold up the 5 stars I gave the lunch boofay. Special thanks to the chef who rustled up khai yat sai, a thai omelet stuffed with minced chicken and veggies that wasn't on the menu, but a member of our party ordered in near-fluent thai, surprising both me and our server.Spicy pasta with chicken, Red curry chicken, blushing Buddha (veggies in brown sauce), chicken fried rice, spring rolls, Steak & Chicken with spicy thai lemon garlic sauce, and the khai yat sai were all superb.  Thai custard and fresh Mango sticky rice just sent this meal over the top, but for the portions the price was not over the top.

I've lived here for three years and this was my first visit to Star of India. Not sure what took so long, other than I had no idea it was here ... buried in the back corner of the strip mall in Ahwatukee that houses the Trader Joe's I frequent. (That's where I procure my cornbread and my tea tree lavender liquid dish soap, among other staples.)Anyhow, I give Star of India 3.5 stars. The food was great and the digs were what you might expect them to be for an Indian restaurant buried in the back corner of a strip mall in Ahwatukee: simple but clean. We didn't come here looking for a scene, we came in search of fine ethnic eats, so the modest decorum was cool by us. And the eats were indeed fine and ethnic.The staff was friendly. I do have some advice for our server, however: you have a nice smile and were seemingly helpful in making suggestions from the menu, but try being a little more reassuring once I settle on something. I have enough uncertainty in my life. Example:Server: "How spicy do you like your food, on a scale of one to ten?"Me: (thinking, 'Gee, this is nice. I'm used to the one-to-five scale offered me by most Thai restaurants. There must be a favorable exchange rate right now, what with the economy and all.') "I like my food mild to medium, so let's say five."Server: "Are you sure?"Me: "Ummm ... I think so. Is that considered mild to medium?"Server: "Is this your first time eating here?"Me: "Yes."Server: "You may want to go easy, then."Me: "So ... three?"Server: "Really?"Me: (thinking, 'Don't do this to me. I have enough uncertainty in my life') "I don't know. Again, it's my first time eating here, so I don't have a barometer by which to measure your one to ten scale. What do you suggest?"Server: "Five should be good for you."Me: (perplexed) "That's what I was originally thinking."Server: "Do four then."Me: (again thinking, 'Don't do this to me. I have enough uncertainty in my life') "Let's go with that."Server: "Positive?"Me: (really unsure now) "YES!"The Aloo Parantha was great to start with. It's like naan, only whole wheat and stuffed with potatoes and green peas. Tasty. My Chicken Tikka Masala was very good, although I will do five next time. Alexis S. had Vegetable Korma and they were very accommodating so as to prepare it without nuts. (Something she has grown increasingly intolerant to, especially recently. Sigh. Lucky me.) I snuck a taste when she bent down to pick up her napkin. It was excellent. The Korma, I mean.Uncertainty in my life aside, one thing I'm fairly certainly certain of is that I'm pretty sure we'll be going back to Star of India. I must try the korma next time. And yes, I'm sure! (I think.)I feel really bad about not bestowing five whole stars upon this place in my previous review. In hindsight, the only explanation I have is that I was "holding back" because it was my first visit to ANY Indian restaurant in the valley since moving here and I didn't want to just go carelessly throwing five stars around before experiencing other Indian restaurants. To help you understand what I mean ... It's as if you were an ice skating judge at the Winter Olympics. And the first skater out, say, from the Congo, absolutely blows you away. Like, you can't believe it! But the whole time she's skating  you're thinking 'The Congo? Do they even have skates? Have they ever even seen ice?' And she finishes her routine and it's flawless. But you haven't seen any of the other skaters yet. So you can't go ahead and give her a perfect score, especially without seeing the Russian chick first. But you're not allowed to wait and see the Russian chick before having to submit your score for the gal from the Congo.  They need your score right now! So you ding her for some arbitrary reason, like her skate laces weren't the same length as each other. Or something.And then you get a chance to watch the other skaters, Russian chick included, and they were all just "meh." And you wish you could go back and change your score for Ms. Congo, but you can't; the IOC won't allow that. And you have recurring nightmares about the medal ceremony, where she stands on the podium with her bronze medal, just below the South Korean girl (who trains in the US) and yes ... the Russian chick. But she displays great sportsmanship. She smiles as the Russian flag waves and "Gosudarstvenny Gimn Rossiyskoy Federatsii" (that obnoxious national anthem) plays over the loudspeaker. She is probably happy with her bronze medal. She might even be a hero in her home country. But you know it's just not right. She was done an injustice, and YOU were responsible for it!!Luckily this is Yelp, and not the Winter Olympics. Now that I have eaten at several other Indian restaurants in the valley, I have become a regular at Star of India and would like my previous three star review stricken from the record and replaced with five strong stars. In fact, I'm gathering signatures on a petition that Star of India be renamed Five Stars of India. They deserve their gold medal.

Review Text :
El Mesquite is an outstanding neighborhood spot where tradition meets plate- and the customers are the big winners. As others have mentioned, this is a neighborhood place, where everyone knows each other, and the servers work here forever.If you need corporate clutter, fake ambiance, licence plates on the wall, etc. this is not a place for you. If you like authentic food, warm service and spicy tasty salsa, then grab a table, and tell your taste buds to buckle up.I first went to El Mesquite years ago when I worked downtown. I fell head over heals for their unique chips and addictive spicy salsa. Warning, it is hot, but it's not hot just to be hot, like other places (cough cough, Los Dos...).Being that this is a Mexican restaurant, beloved by locals- you will hear Spanish, laughter, English, and sometimes a combo of  the three. I really do love El Mesquite, they put up with my crap Spanish, and you do not need to speak Spanish to be comfy at El Mesquite. As others have said, when you arrive, you seat yourself, drinks, chips & salsa will be right behind you. Food is great here, and the price point is very good for the value and amount of food you get. I highly recommend the carne asada burro. I know right now America's Taco shop is reigning supreme, but if El Mesquite was near America's, there would be an epic battle because El Mesquite easily beats their carne asada. No bull!$%@.Also amazing is their guacamole, unlike many places, El Mesquite doesn't put a bunch of filler ingredients to make the guac go farther. Jus tasty ingredients, and your mouth will be happy. I also want to recommend getting a quesadilla, they are really tasty and cooked to perfection.Enjoy your trip to El Mesquite, you will not be disappointed, and if you are like me, this place will be in your rotation for 'go to' places!

After seeing Jenna, Sarah and Melissa all give Kam's one star, I realized they are the most intelligent people reviewing Kam's and I had to follow in their footsteps. They're right - Kam's blows. It deserves ZERO stars. You know how you can pin point freshman when they come to the UIUC? Bingo! They're toting around bright orange Illini Union Bookstore bags. Same goes to the people who wait in line at Kam's. The majority are freshman. Underage drinkers who can't hold their liquor. Screw that.Some drunk guy peed on my foot here. True story. I was only eighteen and not proud to be in the bar.You can find cheap drinks with "attractive" and coherent people almost anywhere else in Champaign Urbana. LOOK!Are you a sensible, intelligent human being?  Are you older than 19?  Does your clothing generally obscure your breasts/underwear/genitals from plain sight?  Are you averse to fist-pumping?  Does the pungent odor of beer-tinged vomit make you nauseous?  Well, then, welcome to KAMS - your personal hell.

I came here for brunch on a Sunday with my bf, and we had a pretty good meal. I'd been hoping to check this place out for a while, as it's located just three blocks from my apartment and I'd read good things about it. The food is French, mostly crepes, and pretty tasty. We started with the pate appetizer, which came with cornichons, sweet onion relish, old-style mustard, and baguette: no complaints, it was very tasty. I then had the special French toast, which came with peaches: for some reason I expect fresh peaches, but they were canned. Still, it was pretty good. My bf got one of their loaded savory crepes, which had cheese, ham and a few other things, and I believe he liked it. We also had two glasses of French hard apple cider: delicious.So the food was pretty good (but I still want to give it a try for dinner), and the service was also very friendly. Not too much of an ambiance, but it's still a good place to go.I am pretentious and I love pretension.  Carmon's offers pretension and delicious taste all at once.  I came in for brunch this morning, and loved the atmosphere, the overdone fin-de-siecle details, and....the crepes.I had a delightful buckweat crepe filled with eggs and bacon that was far more classy than a savoury breakfasty thing had any right being.  I was also incredibly nervous as I was sitting with a Harvard professor and talking about Woodrow Wilson, or perhaps just from the very strong double espresso they whipped up here.  Speaking of coffee, if you get a chance, order a cup of regular filter coffee.  They'll pour you a refill from a ginormous metal coffee urn that looks like it was filched from Scheherezade's palace.  No, seriously, it does.  Or from Toulouse LaTrec (at least the John Leguizamo version).Well worth a trip for brunch.

I hate to do this...I just hate to...but I have never experienced this before. I don't know if I can ever return to Buca. Firstly, I knew there was something wrong with the server when we arrived. She just seemed...off...or high. She was very awkward and kept flirting with my date. Not only that, but she completely ignored me as if I wasn't sitting right there. To make matters worse...much worse, our yummy carbonara had a hair in it. A nice long blonde hair. I was done. I pulled it out and showed my date, he looked at it and told me to just get rid of it. Ok, I did, and I stopped eating. He kept eating lol, until...I found another hair!!!!!!!! Yuck!!!! There is nothing worse than someone else's hair in your food. The night was ruined for me, and we both stopped eating, I never speak up when I am unhappy about something. I am just naturally a friendly, non-confrontational girl, but I felt like I had to say something! No one should have to eat food with hair in it, and have to pay $19 for it. Alas, my date didn't want to make things more awkward since  out server seemed to be on the verge of an emotional breakdown. So, I kept quiet against my better judgement. She later returned with the check, which was wrong, and claimed that she would have to pay the difference out of her pocket if she tried to change it. Confused! Then she asked us to do the survey and give her 5 stars. Ha! I just started laughing, I was sure this entire night was a joke. She literally said, as she knelt down to our table and clasped her hands as if in prayer (I couldn't make this up guys) I'm new here, could you please give me 5 stars, for the good of humanity, and for all those people without jobs in the world.) This was entertaining. Then, she proceeded to take my dates credit card and flirt with him some more! She touched his chest and asked if he had any brothers. Holy...cannoli... get me out of here! I was happy to leave, and planned to never return. That woman just creeped me out. Sorry Buca, a previous visit was much better than this one.Booked on Open Table, right after I got the confirming email I called the restaurant and asked if the kitchen table was available. I happen to enjoy sitting in the kitchen. So I was disappointed that my wife and my daughter weren't fans of the experience. But Buca was awesome - they swapped us right out into another table immediately without a wait. Woot!We chose the large tossed salad to start and then three big entrees to share. Yep, that was probably too much food. Huge platter of Eggplant Parmesan. Big tray of cheese manicotti. Ginormous vat of shrimp fettuccine Alfredo. All really delicious, all really big servings. We took a shedload of it home with us.As for the desserts, they are ALSO sized to share. The brownie sundae, by itself, is enough for five people. And we also had what we thought was going to be ONE canoli but was actually three of 'em. Oy, my tummy hurts.

Review Text :
Came here on a Sunday, it was slow and we got our food in good time.Ordered two personal size pizzas, spicy fries, fried zucchini & onion rings. The pizzas were actually really good but the other sides weren't worth it. Tastes plain & over cooked. Ok so the reason why I'm giving this place 1 star is because I saw soooo many health code violations! * A RedBull can on the pizza dressing table.* The woman who charged me was working on a pizza and didn't even wash her hands after she charged me! She just went right back to working on making the pizza! * The same woman who charged me -NOT kidding ...her nails were long & yellow, mind you she wasn't wearing any gloves while putting that pizza together. YUCK!! * Same chick went out for a cigarette break (in the front of the place) and when she was coming back in she brought AND blew the smoke inside the restaurant. Price range in Yelp language is $$I definitely won't go back because if that's what I was able to witness in the front of the place, I don't want to imagine what's going on in the back!!! I don't think I'm being harsh. That was one too many violations in my opinion.I stopped into Ephesus tonight with CM and two good friends before attending the PSO's concert at the Three Rivers Arts Festival.  We were planning to get take out and have a picnic at the concert, but alas, rainy weather struck (surprise, surprise!), so we ended up having dinner here before heading over to Heinz Hall, where the concert had been relocated due to the weather.CM and I ordered a medium Moroccan spiced chicken and plum pizza to share ($14.99), and our friends each ordered pide, with one ordering the Ephesus, and the other ordering the soujcuk ($9.49 each).  Both CM and I enjoyed the complex medley of flavors and textures comprising the chicken/plum pizza, which was complemented by a cup of seemingly homemade ranch sauce served with the pizza.  The plums were dried, and weren't overwhelmingly sweet or fleshy, and lent the perfect hint of sweetness to the savoriness of the chicken and the spicy kick of the sauce.  The sliced nuts (almonds, I believe) were also a nice touch, and the size was more than enough for the two of us.  My only major criticism was that the myriad of toppings made the pizza a bit unwieldy to eat, and often fell off as we ate it.The pide were rather long and thin in profile, and were each topped by a pepper.  I didn't try the Ephesus version, which is topped with ground beef, due to my aversion for that meat.  I did try a slice of the sojcuk pide, however, which is topped with cheese and Turkish pepperoni.  While the pepperoni were different in flavor than traditional pepperoni, the overall effect was reminiscent of eating traditional pizza that just happens to be long and thin.  I didn't try the greens that came with the pide, but they seemed similar to those used to top the chicken/plum pizza, and our friends weren't fans of the sauce, which they found rather oily and flavorless.  However, I did try the tzatziki sauce served with their pide, which was thick and had a great cucumber-yogurt zip.One important thing to note is that Ephesus seems to have relocated since several of the previous reviews were written--they are now located at street level on 4th Ave., and the space is actually rather nicely decorated for a pizza parlor.  Having said that, judging from the amount of phone calls and runs of the delivery guy, the majority of their business still seems to consist of delivery.  Overall, we were pleased with our experience, and would return to try some of their other offerings.

This restaurant was one of the best surprises of my last trip out to Fort Mill.  I was visiting one of our properties and the staff recommended this place for lunch.  Since it was almost literally next door to the property, I figured I would give them a try.  I'm glad I did because the food was delicious and amazingly cheap.I had the lasagna and it was so large I couldn't even finish it and ended up having to put some of it in the refrigerator for later.  Guess how much it cost?  Remember - this is homemade lasgna that tasted like it was freshly made that morning.  Ready to guess how much I paid?  $5.75!!  Yes, $5.75!!  In Atlanta the same thing would have been at least $9.00 if not more.This is a top choice for delicious food at a good price.  Honestly, you can't beat it.

Yowza....  Food so good you'll slap yer Momma!I've driven by this place a gazillion times, and I've been wanting to try it.  I hadn't quite sated my need for Mediterranean food, so I decided to get some take-home.  I'm *trying* to be sort of careful about what I eat and making sure I get more veggies, blah blah blah.  So I got the mixed meat salad -- because I still needed some gyro meat.  All I can say is WOW.  The veggies were fresh and crunchy, the chicken was great -- marinated and really tender.  And, FINALLY, gyro meat that dreams are made of!  Perfectly seasoned, and just freakin good!  I chose the house dressing -- garlic, lemon, and olive oil -- and it was a great choice -- it was awesome.  This big ass salad comes with pita bread, but I'd get an extra, so you can sop up whatever dressing is left.  The service was lovely as well.  The sister of the owner was working this evening, and was so friendly.  I will definitely be coming back.  I can't wait to try more!!!!!!

I enjoyed a wonderful pizza here last night.  My toppings included black olives, mushrooms and artichokes.  My boyfriend enjoyed the baked ziti. We have been driving past this place forever and always want to stop in. Last night when we were decided what to do for dinner I said, let's have pizza and let's look on Yelp for a recommendation.  We decided that Slice of Sicily would be our choice based on closeness to our apartment and the good reviews it received.    We drive up and get a spot right in front!  Hooray for good luck!  There were only two people eating inside so we picked out a table and took a seat.  The tables were all red and white checkered and the walls full of Italian maps and posters.  The west wall was an interesting mural of an Italian landscape with bare trees and sunflowers.  The decor reminded me of how much I missed Italy. We took a look at the menu, ordered and looked on the huge map of Italy next to us.  I asked Gary if he knew where I was born... he knew it was up north.  So I showed him, I also showed him the placed I lived in Italy and the place we are going to retire too.  He always laughs when I say that.  He doesn't know how serious I am!Our waitress was nice and between her and the owner we got everything we needed.  The owner's family is from Sicily, but her mother was born in the states.  Our food was fantastic.  I no longer need to drive all the way to NYPD for New York Style Pizza, I can drive up the street to Slice of Sicily.There was a nice steady stream of people in and out of the restaurant.  They do many to go orders.  They had many regulars.  We will definitely be regulars. I would have given this place 5 stars but when we ordered two canolli's they went back to grab them and came out empty  handed.  They unfortunately were out of canolli batter.  We were a little disappointed but said we'd be back for more pizza and canolli another time.I definitely recommend this restaurant if you like family owned pizza places and great New York style pizza. I hope this review is beyond satisfactory to those who take this site way way way too seriously.  I tried to write a few more paragraphs, but there wasn't anything left for me to cover.

Restaurant name  Comedor Guadalajara

Review Text :
I visited Comedor Guadalajara for the first time last night. This is a gigantic restaurant located in South Phoenix. The Good: The menu is extensive. The salsa they bring with your chips is hot and delicious. Ordered the "three meat plate" (for two) and was bombarded by a metal skillet (with it's own built in burner) heaped with a mountain of steak, chicken, pork, jalapenos, and onions. It was a meal for 4! The flavors were exquisite.The Bad: The decor is bland, and the lights are brighter than the sun.The Ugly: Nothing at all was ugly about the place. The staff and patrons were all very friendly. The bathroom was clean. The place felt safe outside even after dark (they have a security guard posted at the door).There's no better way to undo a 3 mile morning walk than to end up stuffing your face at the Comedor.  This place is muy grande and could be the perfect spot for a very very large dinner party. The parking lot is huge and is tended by courteous security guards who welcome you in at the door. The menu is extensive and offers some unusual items such as Chicharrone (pork rind) and Nopales (cactus) dishes along with an interesting   Caldo de Mariscos (Seafood Soup). Great if you're looking for some food adventure! Que suave~I started my post walk lunch with a cold Pacifico that came with a large frosty mug. Man that beer went down good!  The chips were delivered warm with a side of chili tepin style salsa.  For starters, we ordered the Frijoles con Chorizo dip. I'm not huge fan of chorizo but really enjoyed this dip. The chorizo was mild (not greasy at all) and was served with oven toasted chips topped with melted cheese. We shared a plate of the Chili Verde con Papas which is a rich green chili sauce with chunks of beef, potatoes, and onions served with refried pinto beans and tortilla. For our other dish, we had the Chilaquiles Y Huevos. This dish was the main reason we went to Comedor and it didn't disappoint.  This was layered corn tortillas soaking in a red chili sauce and topped with two over medium eggs and served with a side of frijoles and warm tortilla. The only problem I ran into was eating way more then I should have. It must be a good sign if you waddle out of the place whining and holding your gut.I'll be heading back very soon to try the Nopalito dish and the Pescado Entero Tilapia; Pan Freed "whole" Tilapia. Can't wait!I have been here once. Thank you Genny C. I had the chilaquiles y huevos ($7.95: cut up corn tortillas smothered in red chile and cheese and topped with eggs - i suggest over medium). A huge fan of huevos rancheros, I had never had chilaquiles (or heard of them) before this visit.  They took hold of me! I dream of them now. I wake longing for them. I wish they were served past 10:30. As for the restaurant: the place is ginormous! Don't let the security guards in the parking lot put you off. Instead, let them get the door for you and take comfort in a delicious meal served by friendly staff who will greet you in Spanish but just as easily will answer you in English.i use to go by here every day of the week and never knew this place was open. the parking lot always empty. in fact i've had several people i trust tell me how great this place was..and i never realized..THIS was the place they were talking about. gasp. so i came her with my BFF's family for fathers day. it was pretty damn good. after a very long wait and eventual long walk to the rear dining room we got seated. chips pretty tasty, sales pretty spicy. food was delish..i got carnitas and they were big porky chunks of awesomeness. they gave me large tortillas..which was ok cause i just tore off pieces to pick up meat. my one complaint...it reminded me of my highschool cafeteria. Jaguar Pride What!! anyways..the vast openess and still confined spacing of the restaurant. if there was a fire breakout..i don't think anyone would make it out alive tho. :(carnitas were bombdigity yaheard!! get on it. price is affordable, and the menu distinctly not, run of the mill "mexican food"It was the 2nd meet up for The International Supper Club and this time Comedor Guadalajara was the place to be!From the outside, you are not quite sure of what are you are getting into, you walk up to the place and you see a huge concrete pad that looks like it's used for outside parties maybe?  You go through the doors and then are shown your table and your mind is thinking how is it possibly this is the same building you were looking at on the outside.  It's huge, and opened, and I didn't even see the entire place. It's well lit and the colorful! A very nice surprise!We were a party of 8 and our server was Maria, and she was amazing, she made sure we had everything we needed and more. When you 1st walked in the podium for the hostess says NO SPLIT CHECKS, so our party didn't even ask, we would have figured it out, but when it came time for the check, Maria had already split them up for us.  Love great service!The chips are fresh, the salsa, well for me it's perfect! I could have stood it a tab bit hotter, but it had the perfect bit of heat for me, but for a fellow dinner, it was too hot for him.Ordered a cheese crisp and some guacamole for appetizers and the cheese crisp was just that, a cheese crisp nothing too exciting to write about, but the guacamole, omg it was soo fresh tasting, I loved that stuff!! I think I might have even licked it off my fingers, I'm sure I could have eaten the entire bowl myself  (or did I).One of the Wednesday night specials was a poblano pepper stuffed with cheese and topped with green chili sauce with grilled chicken, and it came with beans & rice. OMG AMAZING!!!!!!!!!! I didn't even see it on the menu but damn I want it again! The pepper was fresh, the green sauce was delish, and the grilled chicken just tied this dish together! The beans and rice were perfectly cooked. AMAZING!!!!My meal filled me up pretty well, but I did order a churro, and it was the perfect way to end a great meal. Love churros!!! Warm pastry stick covered in cinnamon and sugar. Oh yea I went home a happy girl for sure!We had been looking for a solid Mexican place that is genuine, but in the good way.. not that other way. This place delivered. When someone asks me if I know a good Mexican restaurant, this will be my recommendation. It has the standard quirks that Mexican restaurants usually comes with. What quirks you may ask? You know.. the quirks. Very roomy too, check out other customers pictures. They start you off with a tasty soup, that I only can imagine that is free. The prices can look like they are a bit on the high end for a place  like this (relative, they are not expensive), but then again when you have this rate of return customers, you can charge that little extra.. and you as a customer get it back in quality, and quantity. I didn't finish my full plate.The chicken chimi.A massive chimi. One! The size of 3 normal chimis. More than enough rice, more than enough beans covered with cheese. Yes, this seriously was not in my diet.. but I was hungry, and I got stuffed. I would definitely have this again. The waitresses is good and patient. No mistakes, and took our silly questions with a smile. No, I think I have found my go-to Mexican place for now. They deserve their reputation.. and they have been there forever, which means like 40 years or something.Comedor Guadalajara in S Central is housed in a great building.  Large restaurant - absolutely beautiful - high ceilings, with a comfortable waiting area, and spacious table arrangement.  Family oriented.  They definitely cater to the Mexi brethren.  The host guided us to the table for what seemed like the distance of an average Phoenix block and I was like, "Oh this is still part of the restaurant?!"  The menu is large enough for a nearsighted grandma complete with a few pictures for folk like me who are constantly asking:  what's that, how's it, who dat?  If you're short on cash that week or forgot your wallet you can easily fill up with the sopa appetizer (a vegetable pasta soup) they bring upon seating and the obligatory corn tortilla chips.  The chips were warm.  Mmmm.  And delicious with spicy salsa.  I also ordered some churros.  Made-to-order.  Hot hot hot and yum yum yum.  If I return to CG, it'll be with a different flock, and I would like to have a peck at one of the molcajetes or something out of the mariscos category because my own snobbish preference is for more upscale dishes.  Word to the wise:  if you want to eat here, you best be an early bird because they're not open all day.  And prepare to wait about 20 min for a table, even at the break of lunch time.  This place is more popular than a high school jock and cheerleader couple.Comedor Guadalajara was the place picked for May's breakfast club, let's just get the eh parts out of the way 1st, They do not take any reservations (so I was told) but they do have plenty of seating but you have to wait until at least ¾ of your party is there before being seating.  2nd, they do no split the checks and they said only a max of 5 cards per check, so if you are coming with a party, make sure to bring cash, and take in to account that tip & tax is per everyone in the party, not just what you order. The bill was sort of a cluster, but we got through it.I came for breakfast, but when I heard what my son was ordering dangit I wanted it too, plate envy right off the bat. I ordered the machaca chimichanga with verde sauce. It was shredded beef, eggs, jalapenos, onions & tomatoes, I figured even though it was on the regular menu and not breakfast, the fact that it had egg in it made it ok. The burrito was delish, the meat was tender and juicy the jalapenos fresh and vivid in color, the verde sauce was so good! Before I knew it the burrito was gone! It did come with a side of rice & beans as well.  Another great meal at Comedor Guadalajara, and fun time with the breakfast club!

Been ordering from these dudes for a long time and usually wait until my wife is on out of town and I'm not in the mood to cook. Ha!The inside of this restaurant is a little scary and pretty dark. I've never really seen anyone eating in here. They do have a little fish tank with some big fish swimming around in circles and looking for attention. I get hungry just watching them.Most of their menu is your typical American style Chinese and nothing that would be considered authentic or what they really eat overseas. It is hard to find the real stuff and when you do they end up closing.Always order the Volcano Beef and have them make it extra spicy. The House Lo Mein is also very good and my wife seems to enjoy that one the best. Usually upgrade to some Fried Rice to take things up to the next level.This place is probably best for a night of heavy drinking and getting it delivered to the house. The food is ok but the prices are higher than other places with a similar menu. The delivery times can also vary depending the crew that is working that night.More or less this place is a Meh experience with slight touches of A-OK. The best part is you will have some tasty leftovers the next day to work off any type of party residuals. BEER ME!2.5 STARS

Review Text :
We're new to Champaign-Urbana and decided to try The Great Impasta after reading that it serves fresh/homemade pasta. My husband and I went with our families who were helping us move in. When we arrived, we were promptly seated at our reserved table. I should have realized than an almost empty restaurant on a Saturday night is never a good thing. I picked up my bread plate to move it and saw a squashed tomato underneath.  We then proceeded to wait at least 20 minutes to even be served water or asked for our drink order. When we finally got around to order, we had to listen to a pretentious and inattentive server. When my  mother-in-law (not a foodie) asked for her tuna medium well, the server told her that it's only good if served rare and it was a crime to serve medium-well, which was very rude. I agree a tuna steak should be seared and gets dried out and flavorless past medium-rare- but- there are better ways to approach the situation. Perhaps suggest that the chef likes to prepare it medium rare, but we have a nice salmon that you may enjoy more. The menu indicated that the Fettuccine Alfredo sauce had egg in it (which is not authentic Alfredo) and I asked if the chef could leave out the egg because I was pregnant and unable to have eggs that were not fully cooked (Hollandaise and Bernaise  sauce, Caesar dressing, and homemade ice cream are also on the forbidden list for the same reason). A halfway decent chef should be able to do this with their eyes closed- especially since Alfredo is traditionally only butter and Parmegiano-Reggiano or Parm-Butter-Heavy Cream.  The waiter would not even go back and ask the chef about this- he simply refused (and this was for health purposes- not taste preference- I am visibly 7 months pregnant), again, rudely. We then inquired about the ravioli, which it turns out, is not made fresh, and the pasta with clam sauce- which is made with canned clams- not fresh ones. How was the food we actually ordered? Bad. I ordered a fettuccine with chicken and what was supposed to be a bacon/cream/white wine sauce. It was so bland, no amount of salt or grated cheese could salvage the dish. No hint of bacon or wine or any aromatics like garlic or shallot. The "fresh fettuccine", which should be thin and light, was so thick and dense- I would rather eat dried Barilla fettuccine or the refrigerated Buitoini stuff from the supermarket.  My husband ordered pasta with a red sauce that resembled Prego- it was so sweet and pasty. My mother ordered the salmon, which came rare. She prefers her salmon medium/medium-well and asked the server to please bring it back to the kitchen and cook further. He told  her "it's supposed to be that way." A good server would have said, I'm sorry, I will take care of this right away- and done it- NOT argued with the customer. You couldn't pay me to go back. I've had better meals at the Olive Garden- and that isn't saying much.

I stopped by last night for dinner with CM after we'd spent the afternoon at Duquesne University, since I had a City Dining Card for Salonika, and it'd been awhile since CM and I had had Greek food. The first thing to note that surprised me a bit is that Salonika doesn't provide table service--orders and payment are accepted up front, and food is provided on trays that you take to a table in the dining area.  The staff bus the tables, which clearly needed doing at the time of my visit.Based on other Yelpers' recommendations, I ordered the rosemary half chicken with lemon potatoes ($7.39), and CM did the same.  While the flavor of this entree was decent, I found it extremely greasy, and I suspect the chicken wasn't of the best quality, since pieces of bone kept breaking off and ending up in my mouth.  As for the lemon potatoes, again, the flavor was on point, but the texture was off, such that they were mushy in some places and so hard as to prevent chewing in others. The sauce on the plate from the potatoes had a great flavor, which I used to dip the chicken and complimentary pita bread that came with the entrees into, but it was also quite greasy from the chicken.CM and I also decided to order dessert, with him ordering the baklava and me ordering the chocolate cake, which looked super-tempting in the case.  I'm happy to report that the cake didn't disappoint--it was substantial and moist with thick, fudgy icing and a pleasant, though unexpected, tinge of anise flavor.  I tried a piece of CM's baklava, and enjoyed it as well--it had a generous coating of honey, and plenty of chopped nuts.Overall, I found the food at Salonika to be inexpensive (at least, for entrees and the Cultural District) and flavorful, but to be lacking somewhat in execution.  I'd consider returning the next time I'm downtown and have a craving for Greek food, since I believe Salonika is one of the few gyro places downtown that stays open beyond lunch hours.  If I'm looking for a nicer sit-down dinner, however, I'll pass Salonika up for one of the many other restaurants in the vicinity. 3.5 stars.

They are very, very, VERY racist!! This is my 3rd time visiting this yummy Mexican place. The food is AMAZING! Sadly they are racist :( The first time I ate food from here my husband got it to go(my husband is white...blonde hair, green eyes), while I waited in the car. He ordered me nachos and got him self carne asada fries. The nachos were really yummy, but they didn't have a lot of toppings. I went back on my own about a week and a half ago and the food they gave me was AMAZING! It was 100 times better than what my husband got! I'm middle eastern, but can pass as Mexican. I assumed my food was better because there was a man working the register and cooking the food. I decided to go back a few days ago for lunch because the food was sooooooo good! Well, this time there were women behind the counter....they were super nice and friendly! I noticed some white people come in and her attitude completely changed, she was rude and almost seemed annoyed that they were there. Their food was ready before mine, the quality was the EXACT quality my husband got! My food was ready right after theirs, and mine was AMAZING wayyyy better than what they got!! I don't think they like white people....the whole menu is in Spanish! I can read and speak Spanish...so it's no problem for me. I think if they really wanted Americans in their restaurant.... they would translate the menu. I give it 3 stars because they are nice to me and the food is AWESOME! I take away the other two because they were not so nice to my husband :(I was in the area and decided to try out this Taco shop since I don't live nearby.  When I walked into the restaurant, I thought I would have an awesome meal...but it turned out to be mediocre.  Here's what I ordered:Beans/Rice/Cheese Burrito, $3.10Carne Asada Taco, $1.33The BRC Burrito was ok....the Beans didn't taste fresh.  The Carne Asada Taco was pretty good, but didn't have that "addictive flavor" to it.  I love Mexican Food and judge restaurants by asking this simple question..."Will I get the urge to drive a long distance (15+ min) to eat there?".....in this case, the answer was "no".Return Factor - 30%

Oh I don't know what the big deal is. OMG!...people scream at me...you HAVE to eat at Honey Bears. It is soooo good. So I go. Hmmm...WTF. I order a pork sandwich, side o slaw and side o potato salad. Sandwich came with all the s.o.s. which on one hand is good cuz otherwise the bun would fall apart like my Aunt Helen did when I told her I was a homo. But the meat suffers from not "marinating" in said sauce. Slaw was passable but the potato salad had that weird store bought, vinegary, mustardy, icky poo cocka flavor. Ya'll know what I mean! I guess I'll just have to wait til I hang with the inlaws in San Antonio cuz then we always go to Bill Miller BBQ and sistahs let me tell you Mr. Miller knows BBQ!Sure do love some Honey Bears!  Cheap tasty eats for us carnivores.  Luckily for me, this location is 5 minutes from my work making it one of my favorite lunch break spots.  I would give it an extra star if it had the cool ambience of the Van Buren location but alas, it feels like a 1980's fast food joint.As I left the Heard museum parking lot and headed north on Central, I thought I might stop at Fez and try their Feb. pasta special.  (What I really wanted to do was to head over to Rose and Crown to meet with new acquaintances, but I didn't want to worry about parking...)  On the way, I spotted HBB on the left, but I kept going north for Fez.  However, it seemed like I'd never get there, so I gave myself a stopping point- if I hadn't reached Fez by the next light, I was going to turn around and interrogate the poor soul that happens to greet me at Honey Bear's.  The poor soul's name was Rich, who informed me that HBB only has one sauce, and unfortunate for me, it contains *.  (I received the same response at the Glendale Chocolate Affaire, but I assumed the "one sauce only" was for convenience purposes.  See?  Never assume.)  He sold me on the fact that they marinate the meats in a spice and vinegar-based marinade.  Alright, I'll try a 1/2 pound (about $8 w/ tax) of pork (his fave) and beef (which the young man, who patiently waited behind me while I asked poor Rich so many questions, ordered after I stepped aside and considered my options).  No, wait, I'll have a full pound (about $15 w/ tax), and could you add chicken, too?  And bbq sauce on the side, please. While I waited for my take-out order, I asked Rich if I could sample the sweet potato pie, and to my surprise, he handed me a slice, told me to grab a spoon, and help myself!  It took only one teaspoonful of that slice for me to decide on purchasing a whole pie ($12) to go.  So how did the meats taste w/o the bbq sauce?  The chicken was very bland and pretty dry.  The beef was not much better, but at least it had some mouth-feel.  The pork was the clear winner, esp. since its marinade had the added benefit of red pepper flakes.  Would I go back for more meat?  Unless HBB designs a non-* based-sauce, no.  Well, maybe for the pork.  And only if I was carrying a bottle of bbq sauce in my purse.1 star each for the pulled pork, sweet potato pie, and for Rich being such a sport.  (Kudos for letting me sample the pie!  Letting people sample is always good for business!).  p.s.  If HB had a shack that only sold sweet potato pie, I'd give it 5 stars!p.p.s.  Honey Bear BBQ, please add candied yams/sweet potatoes to your menu!  While you're at it, add some sweet potato fries, as well!Allergy update: I concluded that the sweet potato pie must contain * ingredients bec. I went through two days of horrible allergy symptoms.  I won't be able to enjoy it anymore, but for those w/out allergies, do give it a try!Big  Thank you to Honey Bears to start off, why you ask ? Because they were open ! Wish I could give a 1/2 star extra for that.  Listen Downtown!  you   want me  to bring my family and friends down on the weekend,you want us to explore downtown and use the metro rail,   we need some family friendly , hopefully locally owned,  places to eat !  So 1 big ole star for that!  Now for the rest ...Honey Bears has that  hole in the wall , down south feel to me , and that alone will probably bring me back at sometime .  Especially if I have kids with me otherwise it's Switch, Matt's or Fez. Okay and now for the hits:This is a  good  place for pulled pork or BBQ chicken sandwich ...don't stray from that and you will be happy , husband and kiddos gave a big two thumbs up for that... lil mini me had a 1/2 chicken dinner  w/o BBQ sauce ( weirdo)  and pronounced it good.  Mine were  ribs which were very small, not meaty and I had trouble with tang of the vinegar based sauce.(BTW hubby loved it ) Portions were big on everything but my ribs.  Faux Daughter number 2 couldn't finish her sandwich. I could eat a big ole plate of the mac and cheese wow cheesey goodness... kids agreed.Fries were rumored to be good , one of my kids said  better than in -n-out the others shot her a dirty look .. so you try them and see. Loved the coleslaw and I wouldn't  share it with anyone .Corn was good but not memorable. They have RC and Seven up products which goes to show it's old school I guess. If you can't abide by that bring your own I guess. Service was great, the dude taking our order was personable, helpful and patient with our big order. They also redid mini me's order when it first came with BBQ sauce. Place is nicer than Stacey's for ambiance but I don't really look for that with BBQ , do you?Five dollars and thirty cents for a pulled pork sandwich with a side of sauce? Sorry, Honey Bear's, but I'm not feeling you. Why, oh why, did I go on a day when they didn't serve catfish, which I love from here. Perhaps when I blow off some steam over a sandwich this small with no side dishes costing over $5 I'll return for your fish fry. Until then, see ya.This is legit, I ordered combo #2 at 2:45 pm 3-1-14 and at 3:40 pm I had to walk to the counter and ask how much longer my food was going to be, the reply was 5 minutes there is one order ahead of you.NO "i am sorry for the wait, let me see whats taking so long." Nothing.I replied with you have three minutes or I want a refund. Well 5 goes by, Ok I want a refund. It took about another 5 minutes for him to get permission from his "manager" whom may or may not have even graduated high school. At this point I have been robbed 1 hour of my life, with no apologizes, with no interaction with management, or any  sense of customer service.  There would be a zero star here if i had the option. Absolutely yummy food, when properly serviced. I mean their was not one single resemblance of an adult in this establishment. Its like they all got high in the back and had no sense of time, or surroundings. I understand if you have a few new people that you are training. But WTF....Oh and on the way out some one told me calm down...Me calm down you robbed my of an hour of my life, made me hungrier than what i was, and told me to calm down. That is not how you deescalate a situation. Never again Honey bears will I treat you to my hard earned money. And frankly the gentleman before me should have been more furious than me, he called in his order and sandwich with whatever side, you handed him a bag with a side of sauce, no apologizes for him or any of your other LOYAL customers. Dam I am MAD.                                    Thanks for nothing,                                                        Augustina AKA ROBBEDThis was my first time to this place and probably the last! When you walk in to any service business you expect a certain amount of kindness and professionalism. Well not here. we were met with a rude cashier who kept screaming NEXT as if there was no one in line. Next I saw all these signs telling you what you can't do in this place like do not dump anything in the soda dispenser drain and check your order before you leave and so on. Finally when we were able to place a order the extremely rude cashier seemed so irritated that we actually had the nerve to enter this place that she had no desire to even take our order or answer any questions that we had. The price was decent but on the expensive side, 20 dollars for 2 people without drinks. So we finally get our order and knowing that i have to check my bag because i read the sign that had it printed in BOLD letters, I noticed that I was missing my potato salad. So the rude cashier looks over and says WHAT. And I said I'm missing my potato salad so she opens the cooler and basically throws it at me with very good accuracy as if she has done this many times. So then my brother asked her if she missed his potato salad also and she screams out I DON'T KNOW CHECK YOUR BAG, As if she has somehow forgotten what she put in there 30 seconds ago. Bottom line food is good but it's not worth the effort you have to go through to get it. The staff is so bad that I will go out of my way to go somewhere else. The owners should be aware that the service of this place has gotten to the point that people won't even go there so they don't have to deal with the worst service they have ever had. In todays economy where people are choosing carefully where to spend their money you need to have something special and this place should put up a big sign that says:GO AWAY WE DON'T WANT YOUR MONEY!!!!!They will never get anymore of mine.

I took my staff here for a happy hour retirement party for our boss.  The service was prompt and attentive, the ambiance was nice, with soft lighting and non-intrusive music playing in the background, and the meat and cheese platters and bruschetta I ordered were all delicious.  This was a hit with the staff and I can easily see coming back here for another event soon.

Looking for a casual lunch spot with moderate prices and a large selection of sandwiches, salads, drinks, etc...? Look no further than Sacks.  Not only do they deliver on the attributes I mention above, but they also deliver literally (with a minimum $25 order and they charge just a gratuity that goes to the driver).I used to frequent this Sacks when they were located at 48th St and Indian School, and just recently remembered that they relocated just down the street at 42nd and Indian School.  I've been several times in the last few weeks and have been a satisfied customer for sure.  I usually go for their Cobb Salad (no onion and add avocado) with balsamic dressing.  I love that Sacks is fine with modifications to their menu items!  I'm also a fan of their egg salad, the Sacks Symphony Sandwich, and the Sacks Impressionist Sandwich.  I love that they have Snapple drinks and lots of iced tea fountain options as well as Sun Chips!  Their cookies (they come with every meal) are another nice perk if you're not watching your sweet intake!I must say, I do miss the crackers that they used to serve with the salads awhile back.  Perhaps they will bring those back sometime soon?!I have yet to take advantage of the delivery service mentioned above, but I do plan on using that in the future when I can't get away to pick up or eat there.  Glad to have yet another reliable lunch option in the hood!

Have you ever watched them make this sandwich?  It's a special craft for sure.  They take two pieces of white Italian bread.  Pile on your choice of meat and cheese....then the grand finale....cole slaw and fries!  Then the put both hands on the sandwich and proceed to smoosh it all down flat. All this is done with their bare hands, no gloves here, so all you sanitary peeps beware! I don't know why it's such a fantastic sammy, but trust, it is!  I think it's just the combination of delicious (and fatty) ingredients that does the job.  It's just one more food experience that makes Pittsburgh's dining unique. If you're visiting Pittsburgh, go here?  If you're new to Pittsburgh, go here! If you just need your fill of a sandwich with more sides on it than you usually order in a regular sitting, go here!A solid 4-stars for a solid-as-hell sandwich! I mean, why mess with silverware?...just pile all those side dishes (slaw and fries) between those buns and get to work. You should be full for approximately 29 hours. On a recent beautiful day in Pittsburgh, my pal Rachel C and I popped over to Primanti Bros. Of course, an institution...visitors must at least try it once. Like Deep Dish pizza in Chicago or bagels in New York. You just gotta, ok? Locals seem to be split on whether its worth it...so, saddle on up to give it a shot yourself. Sitting outside on Market Square in the sunshine (and with Batman filming in the near distance!), we embarked on my first Primanti experience. Bros is right...these are definitely NOT dainty sandwiches, by any means! DO not come here on a first date, there is literally no way to eat this beast politely. My turkey and cheese was a "lighter" option, if that exists...but I will still full for the requisite 29 hours or so. Did it blow my mind? No. Did I find it fun and interesting and did it taste good? YES! Wash it down with a Diet Coke and we were set to jet to take Pittsburgh by storm the rest of the day. Or, needed a nap. Wear the stretchy pants. *accepts credit cards*great for groups*very quick *friendly serviceI like sandwich and stuff as much as anyone else. this place was pretty good. The prices were good also. the staff was good. Everything worked out the way it should. There were no negative surprise. No poistive surprises either. It was a nice resturant.

We saw this place on Diners Drive-ins & Dives, just like so many others, and decided to give it a try on our way to Asheville today.And...I am soooo glad we did!First...yes, the intercom system is dated, and hard to hear, oh well...I chalk that up to character. We didn't know what to order, so my lovey hubby went inside to ask what they recommended. David asked him, "How many you got?" And proceeded to invite us inside to sit and eat...they only have 2 stools, and we felt happy to be invited. (He also said, "bring your missus inside, and we'll take care of you.)The inside is just as dated as the intercom...but, we asked what to order and they recommended the BBQ chicken and BBQ pork plate.Now, I must admit, we are from Augusta, and as true Augustians, we have one BBQ love...Sconyers...it is simply the best in the world, and we have been bred to eat it.But, BBQ King does a real decent job of the pork!!! I was happy to share the plate with my lovey hubby, and we enjoyed it...the sauce was Texas Pete based...and very tasty.I must give a mention to their cole slaw...they have a "secret" ingredient, which just happens to be MY secret ingredient also!!! Celery seeds... and they really make for a tasty slaw! (try it next time you make cole slaw...it is so good!)I've saved the best for last...their BBQ dipped fried chicken. Now, I saw this on Guy Fieri's show...and didn't think it could be good at all...I thought, "Fried chicked, dipped in sauce??? It'll get all soggy...won't be good at all..." Well, folks...I was WRONG. They fry it so crispy...then dip it at the last minute before serving...so you get this absolutely delicious, crispy, juicy, tender BBQ chicken. I will go on record as saying: BEST BBQ CHICKEN EVER...possibly the best fried chicken ever!!! It really is that good...it is incredible and original...and I can't believe that every where doesn't serve chicken like this.Last, but not least...get the cherry sun-drop...yes, it is sun-drop, but with cherry syrup...I've never had it anywhere else. (I'm very sheltered, obviously!)BBQ King (which was featured on Diner, Drive-ins an Dives) is my go-to for comfort food for those days that happen once in a while ... Bad days, good days, days where it's raining outside, days where the scale is in my favor, days when the scale has a glitch and I'm five pounds heavier, days between Sunday and Monday, etc. I love the BBQ Friend Chicken. Great taste. Good value. Nom. Nom. Nom.Location: 3/5It's right on Wilkinson which is a pretty big, busy 4-lane roadway if not divided highway. Not the easiest to navigate into and out of but it's well worth the hassle and potential car wreck.Atmosphere / Ambiance: 3/5 BBQ King is an old-school drive-in joint where the car hops come to you car with your grub after you placed your order in a Charlie's Angels speaker-box. Think of Sonic but ya know, like back in the 60's and stuff. It probably hasn't been updated much since then either. But yeah, who's going here for a date? PSA: I would love to be brought here for a date, but that's just me. Cleanliness: 4/5See above.The facilities are dated but my food has also been on point in terms of hair to food ratio. Service: 4/5The Car Hops are cordial and friendly. The staff inside are likely as well.Food: 5/5Dear Little Baby Jesus, that BBQ Fried Chicken is amazing. It stays crispy even while slathered in tangy BBQ sauce. I can't string the words together that'll do justice to this culinary masterpiece. I love BBQ and I love fried chicken and I have become some what of an aficionado so yeah, I know my stuff. You will not be disappointed. The hush-puppies are legit too.

Review Text :
Gentrification be damed, this place is still (barely) standing. First off let me warn you that the salsa that comes with the chips is HOT. Not just a little spicy - like 5 alarm rip your own tongue out hot.That aside, the food here is really good. I usually order 3 rolled chicken tacos with gaucamole or the cheese enchiladas. They never get it wrong. Everything on the menu is cheap, fast and damn good. They are also speedy with the drink refills which always rocks.Also, you can actually catch a bus to Jaurez from their parking lot as the local scary bus to Mexico departs from the depot next door. That is pretty hot too."Are you kidding me Laura?!?!""OMG we are going to get shot!!""Dude this is a fucking double wide."This is what I heard upon entering the parking lot. "Hell yes we are eating here I don't care what you say!!"I like it no matter if Veronica R (my sister) did not like their green chili. Its a taco place order the tacos!! Yes the rice was overcooked and a bit crunchy hopefully its not like that all the time. The beans were FANTASTICO they tasted like the ones my Abuelita used to make. The salsa was not for the weak its nice and spicy just how I like it. I had the shrimp tacos as my entree see pics, they were delicious I cleaned my plate!!Cheapest beer ever I had a Bohemia for $2.50 they are $6 anywhere else!! We also took some Horchata and a Mansanita glass bottle to go mmmm. This place was clean and reminded me of Mexico inside, if I am in the area I would not hesitate to stop in here for a bite.Shout out to Danny S for recommending! TY!!five stars is simply not enough.i was always scared to try this place. i don't even think i knew it was still a functioning restaurant. i'm glad i was wrong.so two gringos walk into a mexican taco shop next to a mexican bus station....badump bump.OMG!! wtf have i been missing here. i got a carne asada burro and a soft chicken taco...taco was awesome. the corn tortilla was soft, supple and tasted awesome. piled high with lettuce some sliced radish and i squeezed some lemon ontop. i murdered this taco. execution style. imagine finding a duffle bag full of heads in Juarez...well this taco belonged to one of those heads..understand?the burro was very tasty. the meat seasoned well and only two bites did i find some grisly bits. the carne asada was rolled up with some diced tomatoes and a cup of pico on the side. i kinda prefer my CA Burrito with a heap of Guacamole like how FilliB's makes them. but this was really tasty and i will order it again...after i check out the other items on the menu of course. you will now find me here every saturday morning. the tacos at Tacos De Juarez will soon refer to me as the Chalupacabre.Power yoga class today. What great way to detox your body and find all the muscles and balance points you rarely use (you'll find them the hard way, BTW, but that's another story).As I was lying on the mat at the end of the class, listening to Max (our instructor/Chief Yogi), telling us to just be and to try to not think...try not to eat or drink for an hour after the session and just let our bodies detox, all I could think of was "what can I eat to retox as quickly as possible, that won't kill me where I stand?"Not an easy question to ponder, even with the existential power of yoga still pulsating through every fiber of my being...a chili dog from Ted's or Long Wong's?; an Italian Beef  from Luke's; Chicken and waffles from Lolo's?And then it hit me, almost causing me to stir from my yoga induced coma, Taco's de Juarez!!!!!As anyone who has read even one of my reviews will tell you, I am a "Trendinista" of the first order. I follow the herd, make no mistake about it! Why?Because, occasionally, the herd knows where it's going...and this is one of those very special occasions!I had spotted this place before...on my way by at high speed, to get to Welcome Diner for a burger.But since I wasn't packing, I never, ever stopped rolling, let alone got out of my car here. Yelp changed all that. This place has some terrific reviews, in spite of the fact that there isn't a Betos or Bertos in sight. Worth a try, right?Taco's of Juarez is a delightfully dirty little gem...the proverbial diamond in a goat's ass. I sat down and the sweet little non-english speaking waitress brought chips and salsa...The Two Grinders (Los Dos Molino's) need to take salsa lessons from these folks...some of the best salsa I have had (the salsa verde is definitely the best I've had in the US...makes me long for couple of places along the beach in Bahia de Navidad).In an effort to retox as quickly as possible, I ordered the number 16 lunch especial...a shredded beef gordita ("gordita" means "meat wrapped in lard, then deep-fried" in Spanish) and a cerveza (ice, ice cold BTW).Freakishly good...I know, it was almost pure lard that had been heated to point where it lost its molecular cohesion and liquefied...but it was damn tasty lard. I forked a little salsa chile and salsa verde onto the gordita (accompanied by refritos and rico) and dug in.I awoke to shouts of "clear" as the feverish paramedics worked to restart my heart...just kidding! I am fine:) !!So, go to the pawn shop and find yourself a nice little Sig Sauer 9mm pistol and holster, turn on the car alarm and go try Taco's of Juarez. Possibly the best Mexican food in town!And now, another one on my list of favorite places to retox after I've detoxed!I ended the work week on a nice note when I met Donald S and a new friend at Tacos De Juarez for lunch on Friday.  We enjoyed good conversation amidst the early Goodwill high back dining chairs, the Formica tables mixed with the old Ethan Allen desks serving as tables (thanks for that insight Mark) and crowd of diners from a broad swath of life.The chips were good, standard stuff.  The red and green salsa was also tasty, although the red is mild bordering on hot and the green is just hot.  I recommend waiting until your drink arrives before starting in on the green salsa.I wanted 2 enchiladas.  They come with cheese and I wanted one with cheese and one with chicken added.  There was a bit of language difficulty and I ended up with 2 chicken enchiladas.  But let me start with the basics because that is where my judgment of a Mexican restaurant begins:  rice and beans.  If they miss on the basic rice and beans then they will have a hard time getting me back.  The rice and beans were good.  Not greasy, not dry.  Great.  On to the enchiladas.The chicken enchiladas were smothered in a generous amount of enchilada sauce and cheese and filled with a hearty portion of stewed chicken.  Good stuff.I will absolutely add Tacos De Juarez to my list of good & cheap restaurants.  And having been in the El Paso/Juarez area recently I can say that even though the neighborhood immediately surrounding Tacos De Juarez looks a little sketchy it is not.  For example there were no poor souls executed and left hanging from a chain link fence here as there was a couple weeks ago along the border.

We were out this way yesterday just exploring and when we drove by my daughter said that looking like a good place so we had an early dinner there.  I like the atmosphere, cool and laid back, very island like.  There is surfing stuff all over and surfing videos on and the staff is friendly and laid back too.  We had great service.  Drinks arrived promptly and we were checked on several times during the meal.  My daughter had an accident with her milkshake and our server brought her another one quickly, napkins to wipe up with, and wet wipes for her sticky hands.  I had the Baja soft tacos.  They were good but lacking something...I dont know what though.  I had guac, sour cream and salsa too.  They were good but they needed more flavor.  Maybe it was the way the chicken was cooked, I'm not sure.  My daughter had a kid's meal of a hot dog and fries and she ate it all.  I would probably go back and try a burger sometime.Mostly I thought the atmosphere was good, very island ish and I liked it.I've been a diner at Island's for a very long time and they have never failed me. You always know what to expect when you walk in the door. I love a restaurant that can be so consistent for so long! Some of my favorite dishes include their burger (always a good choice), their quesadilla, the tortilla soup (my favorite!!), the cheese fries or plain fries, the chicken tenders, their Shorebird sandwich (LOVE), their BLT, and their Yaki Tacos. As you can see I've tried a lot of their menu options and have enjoyed them all. Island's is a reliable, yummy restaurant that the whole family can enjoy. I will always be a customer!!

I brought my boyfriend here as a date for his birthday. We were very surprised at how small it was! The decor was cute and the tables were pretty close together but we liked the homey and family feel of the restaurant. We did have a reservation and I would recommend getting one if you plan on eating there in a high volume time. As it was we still had to wait a few minutes but our waiter was very attentive and helpful. We started with just the bread. It honestly wasn't anything special but it was good and we really enjoyed the seasoning and balsamic that came with it. We couldn't decide whether we wanted pasta or pizza so we settled on sharing both pasta and pizza. The waiter suggested that we try to the bolognese pasta and that came out first. The sauce was so tasty and the pasta with the cheese inside was cooked so perfectly. It was really awesome. When the pizza came out we were a little weary because it didn't look like anything special but we were so wrong! It was sooooo good. We got whole pepperoni and half sausage and half black olives. The pizza was hands down the best thing we have had in this city. We recommend it to anyone who enjoys pizza. My boyfriend was especially happy because his family is Italian so he is very picky about what Italian food he likes and he LOVED this food. The prices were well worth the food and not too expensive. GREAT for a date night! We live in Scottsdale but we will definitely be making the trip to Chandler to eat here every once in a while....with a reservation of course :).

Cozy, cute and yes, a little claustraphobic...Coronado Cafe. Perhaps the latter adjective is my own issue, but at 5 foot  9 inches I felt REALLY tall. An adorable little home, with creaky wooden floors transformed into a comfortable cafe with approachable American fare. After navigating the dicey, sandy, lumpy parking lot I accidentally entered the kitchen door. My bad. I was redirected to another door and entered through the rear. Yikes did I  just say I entered through the rear? Anyway a lovely staff person told me to go to the front and check in. Meandering through the cafe I really did find it lovely. Very neat, old yet modern and strangely very loud. It was a booming lunch crowd on a Monday. Taking Mom and Dad out for a Mother's Day lunch. We waited a few minutes for a table and were constantly being said hello to and asked if we've been helped by a friendly, friendly staff. Shout out to the staff! The menu, while not especially inventive, seemed fresh and yummy. The soup of the day was a tortilla soup with its own stamp on it. No tortilla strips atop the cup, yet and especially flavorful soup, creamy with a twinge of tanginess to it. Mom and I both had the turkey sandwich with cranberrry sauce. HUGE mother of a sandwich. I always wonder about the big sandwich because you cannot possible bite into it without making a mess. Not a strike against them, cuz it was very good, bread was fresh and turkey seemed unprocessed. Dad ordered the ham and cheese, but stripped away all the interesting flavors, because, well, because he's a dad and likes the meat and potato type menu. Dessert was a wonderful and decedent brownie with ice cream, chocolate and caramel sauces. Very good. Brownie was more like a cake though. Again, no complaint, cuz it was dee-lish. Service was so great I have to say. Friendly, professional and fun. I like the idea of eating in an old house. The contrast of old Phoenix with striking photography of modern New York strewn about the rooms was quite cool. I recommend a visit. I'm craving the tortilla soup and would love to try other items on the menu. Most importantly it was a wonderful way to hang with mom and dad (who ventured in from Sun City in their mini van, navigating the Central Ave. mess, God Bless 'em) and we truly had a good experience. Coronado Cafe. Cute. Cozy. Comfortable. And in the end, not so claustraphobic.Coronado Cafe has character!  What a nice change from the strip mall restaurants that make up most of the Valley.  It's a cute little house, friendly enough staff, and pleasant menu as well.I've been twice so far and was pleased both times.  Once, awhile back, for dinner - Jared and I sat outside (it was obviously not the summer) and had a delightful little date... If I recall, we had one of their homemade soups and a fish special of the day.  Most recently, I met Katie F there for a perfect girlfriend/business lunch.  We met on a Thursday at noon.  I actually arrived a bit early but they will not seat you unless the full party is there.  Not a problem, I had a refreshing raspberry iced tea while i waited.  We were seated promptly when Katie arrived - in a back room that was quiet enough to talk and actually hear each other!  Katie went with the chicken pasta and I opted for the Cobb Salad (I was told it is the newest addition to the menu).  We were both happy with our meals and practically cleaned our plates.  The dressing for the Cobb has a kick; be forewarned, but I enjoyed it.  We didn't leave room for dessert, but the menu was tempting.  Thanks Coronado Cafe for bringing some character to the Valley - I'll be back to see you soon!In the hot AZ summer going to Coronado island is a great idea, however if you can't make the commute the Coronado Cafe is a great 2nd choice.This place has everything you need for a great date.Quaint and romantic old house setting and patios.Table cloths and faux candlesMenu full of artfully presented itemsWines by the glass or bottleBackground music in lieu of background noise.We started our meal with a gargonzola salad, which they did a split plating for us. $6 The greens were fresh the cheese was bountiful and pungent the walnuts were candied and the slices of apple were crisp, what more could you want from a salad?For our main dishes we had the Cherve Rellnos $12, Two large pablano chilies stuffed with well dices zucchini other veggies and goat cheese on top of a generous pile of polenta and a roasted red pepper sauce, it was amazing.The other main was miso glazed salmon with sauted spinach and basmati rice. The fish had a nice crisp crust, the spinach had a nice flavor and the rice was well just rice, it could use a veggie in it to to spice it up.Bottles of wine start at a affordable $12The meal included bread with olive oil.Bottom line great romantic place for dinner or lunch.Never sat on the patio before...  Love that it is November and we can sit outside and enjoy the weather!  The staff is super friendly and always aiming to please.  I ordered the Blanco Flatbread (roasted garlic cream, mozzarella, parmesan-reggiano, and added roasted chicken).  Less the onions for me on this.  It is crispy, light, and delish!  I tried a slice of the Carne Flatbread from Shane's plate.  YUM!!!  The spicy was the right amount.I've never been to Maryland, but I'm pretty sure CC marries their best with old school Phoenix's best.I'll start with what I don't like: I don't come often enough. That's it. My raves: Cutest house turned classy restaurant ever. I've been discovering more & more places like this and CC is by far my favorite. It still feels like walking into mamas kitchen except you get first class service & it's not free ;)Look out for Triple J! Jillian, Janel, & JR always take great care of me!! They all have great attitudes, very personable, and know the menu very well. You can't go wrong with the crab cakes!! Or the miso salmon, mmmm!! Any seafood really. I've complained about my salmon not being cooked properly at other restaurants but that is not an issue here!!I also love the Gorgonzola salad, chicken Caesar wrap, and meatloaf!!!As others have mentioned, it's a great date place whether your date is a spouse, friend, or family member. I noticed a lot of people come in before a play- perfect ambiance for a romantic evening.Get a sitter for the kids- I would give you a Samantha Jones style stare down if you brought in loud grubby children who would definitely ruin my dinner in a cozy place like this. ( I am a nanny who loves children as well as dining out with children. But I also believe in adults having their happy place considering I don't go to the playground with cigarettes & beer to be in the way of 12 & under spring break! Thanks.)Parking lot works, location is great- super close to I-10, but far enough away to not have the noise while on the patio. Sometimes I come in just for a beer since I am in the neighborhood a lot and just melt into that patio. I'll be back soon! (Maybe tonight!)*Tip- Call ahead

I used to like their foodHonestly.It was my one year anniversary.Me and me man went here to celebrateI had a lobster tailAnd a filetOn the way home, I got violently illLike, within ten minutes of leaving this place.And no, I only had a few glasses of champagne :)I ended up going home, and laying on the floor for awhile crying, moaning, vomiting, etcAfter about an hour, I couldn't take it anymoreI called 911The paramedics showed up, I was naked and crying on the floor.It was a VERY romantic anniversary, let me tell you.After a long night at Scottsdale Osborn hospital, it was determined that the lobster tail was undercooked/tainted and made me severly ill.I'll never eat here again.Simply because I've never been so sick.It's a shame though, because on the way down, the lobster tail had these cajun seasonings and really was exceptionally delicious.HOWEVERI contacted Ruths Chris and they refunded my dinner amount, paid my hospital copay, and were SOOO nice and accomodating to my every demand.  Bravo.Although, Boo for almost killing me.Eh, I'm torn.

Folks, hands down this has to be one of the best brunch spreads in Charlotte!!! I met some girlfriends here for brunch on Sunday afternoon. I scored a parking space on the street but they do offer valet and there are plenty of parking garages. The inside of this place is gorgeous. There's plenty of beautiful tile work and it's all windows in the dining area so you'll have a great view. In the warmer months, there's even a lovely patio section! For Sundays there is no regular menu! It's brunch or nothing! But that was totally fine with me! It's one price for all the brunch and tapas plates (mini omelets, french toast, eggs benedict) you can eat.  That brunch bar is loaded! It's got everything:Mac and cheese (cheesy goodness) A Grits Bar (Yep! There are tons of toppings like ham, cheese and bacon crumbles to add if naked grits aren't your thing)Smashed brown potatoes (like hash browns but 10x better) Peel and eat shrimpBiscuits and gravy (mouthwatering good) Herb Crusted Prime rib (tender and delish) SalmonBacon and Sausage EggsShrimp and Grits The grits were nice and creamy! Just the way they should be. And the shrimp were tossed in a gravy sauce mixed with andouille sausage and spinach. With just the right amount of spice and flavor...I could eat this every day!Chili (forget everything you know because it's freaking fantastic) Whew! I'm sure I'm missing a ton of things but it's more than enough variety for you to make sure you leave full and happy. What the heck are you waiting for? Oh and if you somehow manage to have room left after sampling all those goodies....they have chocolate covered strawberries! Yum!

Review Text :
Located in the deep hood on the southside, near the corner of 7th street & Roser in between a liquor store and a recreation center infront of the high school that still holds the record of most student sponsored riots and most confiscated guns in the Nation. Nestled in the crossroads of three of the largest gang's territory in the state, Wong's To Go has been a firm establishment in what can be a very chaotic environment. I personally love the southside... it's tension, it's colorful characters and colorless buildings are beautiful to me.Open primarily for lunch, Wong's has been open for along as anyone can remember. A serious hole in the wall needs to be approached with serious caution - not because of it's surroundings... but because of the curt and often moody cashier. "WAI!" screeched the elderly Chinese woman as she slid the take out window open. "Nee Hoy Sha Yin-Wah-ma?" I asked to the amazment of my good friend Jackie who has never heard me say a word of Chinese in her life. "English?! YES! You speak Chinese?!" She said as her face brightened up. "Wahhh hoy shwah id-yar." Indicating that I only spoke a lil bit of Chinese. We quickly ordered from their very limited menu with limitless flavor. One order of 4 pieces of chicken wings (the entire wing btw) and a quart of beef fried rice. Standing around in tiny parking lot talking about whatever, I noticed how there was a small fridge displaying different energy drinks and sodas. and my friend explained how there used to be picnic tables and even shade for ppl to wait under while their food was being prepared. After the riots between rival gangs, during which one gang used the tables as a randez vous point - the city had asked the Wong's to take out the tables. She described to me how there used to be an open window like in fast food places and how after getting robbed on evening - the wong's changed their hours to closing during the early evening and now have large bars over their windows. I really felt for the Wong's to put so much into their business only to have the tremultous neighborhood love them so much and at the same time be the cause of much of their woes. Just as I was beginning to wonder off into oblivion - our order was up and it was gooooood!!The chicken was crispy and simply fried. No batter, no dredge - nothing... it was delish! As was the beef fried rice that boasted sprouts and a lil char that Jackie requested. Burnt bits are good!  yum! Our entire order was $10! We drove away as a gagle of teenagers hungry after their last class walked up to place their orders. To my fellow yelpers: The southside is a place that is special to my heart. Perseverant, rough and colorful... there are places where it can be scary to venture into... but stay on the main roads and be a polite driver and you should be alright. Go and pay the Wong's a visit but don't be surprised if Mrs. Wong isn't exactly a happy camper. lol. Try the chicken wings, they're GREAT!

Restaurant name  Teutonia Mannerchor

Review Text :
The Teutonia Männerchor is a private club promoting German cultural traditions in the Pittsburgh area. It has over 2,000 members from all walks of life. Mostly, the Männerchor is known for its Ratskeller bar and lunch restaurant and the many German cultural food festivals it has throughout the year. At Lunch, you often find a good German buffet and inexpensive German beers from their bar. Their German cultural festivals are usually well done and very authentic, but mostly populated by an older crowd. Membership (or the company of a member) is required to eat at the Ratskeller for lunch, but non members can attend their German festivals. This place is by far the most "authentic" German club in the area and the food is mostly good. The beer selection is great and the prices for everything are reasonable. If you like German food or have a connection to Germany, you should try this place at least once.

After reading all the other reviews of this place I have determined one thing. You all were obviously on crack when you ate here. Or maybe they gave you crack when you ate here...either way my experience was not the same.Went at about 4:00 on a Saturday, not a busy time for a restaurant so I wasn't scared away when we were the only ones in the entire place, next time, I'll make sure to think twice.They started us off with chips and salsa, and I'm rather shocked that no one has mentioned their chips are a total fail. Salsa was decent, but the chips were an assortment of sweet potato chips, stale blue corn chips, sweet fried chips (sugar and everything), and stale normal tortilla chips. All in one bowl. If they weren't stale, the blue corn and normal chips would have paired nicely with the salsa. But rubbery sweet potato (don't get me wrong, I like sweet potato)  and sugar coated with salsa? Really?We decided that we were going to order an appetizer and then a meal to split, and I love a good artichoke-anything so I ordered the artichoke dip. When it came out (like 20 minutes later) I had to ask them if they brought us the right dish. It was a bowl of queso and no matter how hard I searched, there was not an artichoke to be found. They didn't bring us any other chips to go with it, and let me tell you, sweet potato chips and queso don't go so great together. To make it worse, the menu said it was $6.99 but they charged us $7.79, if it was good I wouldn't have cared so much about $0.80 as I do.I thought a good beef fajita dish with a cup of chicken tortilla soup would be a safe bet, but they couldn't even do that right. They brought out corn and flour tortillas with the fajitas. Word of advice, if they ask you which you prefer save yourself the trouble and get the flour. The corn ones were so wet that they literally tore to shreds when I tried to peel them off each other. There wasn't a whole lot of beef in the beef fajitas either, and what was there was lacking in good flavor. And for the soup, Half Moon Sports Grill makes a better tortilla soup than this place...and they're a sports grill. Overall, food was bad. Service was very slow considering we were the only ones there, and I would never, ever eat here again. Did I mention they didn't give us silverware? We had to go steal it off another table.The other day my coworkers and I decided to go to Canyon Cafe.  Also this restaurant used to be called Sam's Cafe.    They changed names back in February.  So, we got our drinks and we order the Queso dip to start our meal off and then we ordered our food.   Then the Queso dip came out.  It was really good, but it was also a little runny.  Now for our food, when they were handing us the food.  The lady was passing the fajitas across me to my coworker and the juice from the fajitas spilled all over me and my meal.  Luckily I had my napkin in my lap, but it still got on my jeans.  You would think that a manager would come over and apologize for what happen or at least comp my food.  Instead they told me that they would pay for my dry cleaning bill, if I wanted to get my jeans dry cleaned.    Other than the spill the meal was great. I ordered the basin Meatloaf. I totally recommend the meatloaf.  It was one the best meatloaf I have had in a long time.  Last but not least our waiter was really nice and did a great job taking care of us.This place has so much promise, I need to come back and try it again!  The chips and salsa are spectacular.  The service was quite slow, but the restaurant was also quite busy.  It still took an hour and 15min and all I ordered was a salad.  Don't get the Calamari Salad if it is on special.  I should have known better than to get that at a TexMex restaurant, but lesson learned.  The dressing was very good, but the calamari was over-fried and the cucumbers were mushy and disgusting.  Long story short, for lunch I had lettuce with good dressing and amazing chips and salsa for $15.  I saw plates of tacos go by that looked and smelled much better than what I was mulling through.  The waitress felt bad though, she could tell I was not enjoying my meal.  As a consolation prize I was hooked up with a delicious white chocolate tamale when I got my bill.  I will be back, I will choose more wisely, and hopefully things will be better!

In spite of the name on the glass facade, they do not  (or no longer) make dimsum. In fact, the main exterior signage just says, "Kim's Chinese Food." It's a regular take-out place that serves good, standard Chinese take-out dishes. It's strictly take-out, no dine-in.

Awful, awful customer service - so bad in fact that we were too thoroughly disgusted to stay for the meal. We came here on a Sunday afternoon, which was my first and last time.  I've been to other Houston's locations in California - and have had decent times there.  In fact, I love the thai steak salad. However, this time some 20 year old idiot host walked us to our table (and before we even sat down) and told us "My mom taught me good manners, so I've always taken my hat off at the dinner table."  Huh?  First of all, I was dressed nicely in a button up shirt, and was wearing my favorite football team hat who had just won the championship the day before.  Secondly, I hadn't even sat down at the table yet, asswipe.  Thirdly, while I understand this isn't Applebees, this also isn't Ruth's Chris Steakhouse, douche bag.  And don't talk to me like I'm 7 years old.No sooner had the idiot host left before we walked into the kitchen to get the manager  to bitch him out about his insulting employee.  The manager was pretty much dismissive.  Well, guess what - I'm pretty much dismissive about this poor excuse for a restaurant. 1 STAR - not going back!!Houston's - you have not let me down yet... I've been on numerous occasions to this location, and I have not one complaint.  Today for lunch, I met my friend and future yelper Ryan H, and I not only enjoyed the amazing company, but the meal itself.  I chose the ahi tuna salad and a side of spaghetti squash.  Each bite of salad was better than the next; i especially love the dressing, avocado, sesame seeds, mango, and ginger... yum!  And as if the salad wasn't enough food, I had to order the side of spaghetti squash since it's a daily special and I love it so much! Ryan had the ribs and seemed to enjoy those as well!A few weeks ago Jared and I were at this location before seeing a movie at the Esplanade Theater upstairs... we each had a glass of wine and shared the veggie plate which was also divine!  Albeit a bit pricey, but worth the splurge...I'll for sure continue to frequent both this Houston's and the Scottsdale location - one of the few 'chains' in AZ that are worth it.Dependable. Like your favorite uncle who would always sneak you sips of beer. Dependable.Like shrinkage after a cold shower.Dependable.Well. Like Depends undergarments. Houston's. Solid. Dependable. And you know what? Damn tasty! Rickie and I had a pre Slumdog Millionaire lunch and shared the Hickory burger and the oh so famous spinach dip. First off, I have to say I forgot how much I LOVE the fries at Houston's. Totally my fave in all of fry land. The burger was cooked MW as Rickie requested and come out MW. I'm more of a MR kinda guy, but even at MW, this burger did not disappoint. Service is really great. We all know that. It was less robotic than I remember and for that I was grateful. God, I hate those forced, learned corporate bullshit greetings! Ugh...folks here seemed to actually have their own personality! Wow. Thank you Stepford Houston's. Have you loosened that Bolo tie recently?The crowd was uncanny for a Sunday afternoon. Rickie asked me if there was a hooker convention in town! Seriously. It was like a slut buffet parading around. Thanks Houston's. Good to know we can depend on you still. Like humidity in Houston.Or scorching summer temps in Phoenix. And asshats on the yelp threads.Chow my yelpitas!Mediocre and overpriced. There's nothing "New" about their "New American" menu and underwhelmed is the most positive spin I can place on the entire experience. It's a very limited menu with 15 dollar sandwiches and salads, or 25-30 dollar cuts of meat.  Way to cater to the vegetarians out there with a veggie burger or an overpriced "entree" of seasonal vegetables. Do restaurants have any idea how boring it is to eat a veggie burger every time you go out? Get a little creative for christsake, it's not like you're lacking possible ingredient combinations.I had the ahi tuna burger, which was ground down to a mealy consistency and cooked until bone dry.  It was then garnished with grody, unimaginative toppings like pickles and iceburg lettuce. Top it off with a cloying sweet remoulade that did nothing to moisten the sandwich and you've got a bone dry tonsil scraper. The roasted chicken was on the greasy side but well seasoned. The couscous it came with was a misstep though. Someone threw a ton of whole mint leaves into it that made it inedible instead of "fresh," which I'm sure was the intention. The spinach dip was teensy tiny for the price, and why the heck is it served with canned, crappy salsa and sour cream on the side? Weird.The fries were the one saving grace. Skin on, super slim shoestring cut with the perfect amount of salt. But I've had fried and battered bulls balls and they've tasted good. Fry anything and it'll improve the edibility. Service was nearly nonexistant, although as a whole the etiquette was top notch when it was present. But it was a complete disconnect when compared to the cruddy food being slung. You're serving a French dip sandwich, not some wild Top Chef creation. Dial back on the smug.I don't ever see a need to return to a place that serves traditional (nothing new about it!) American food I can make better in my own home. I expect more from professional chefs than chicken sandwiches and steaks.Yawn.Bye bye Phoenix Houston's, hello Phoenix Hillstone!I've been a huge fan of Houston's for years, and had mixed emotions when I heard that they were closing the Phoenix location and opening just down the street under their parent company name, Hillstone.  But after one visit, I'm sold... Hillstone has the same favorite dishes that Houston's had (spinach dip, grilled artichoke, veggie burger, fresh vegetable sides, fries, desserts, etc...) and they have a huge wine list as well.  Service is attentive and sweet (thanks McKenna who was our waitress last night).  Thanks also for going above and beyond and creating rootbeer floats for our table upon request!The Hillstone group did a fabulous job building this new restaurant - it's got a great outdoor seating area, a huge bar, an awesome wine cellar, and comfy booths inside as well.If you still want the old name (Houston's), the location in Scottsdale / Hilton Village is still open, but I highly recommend checking out Hillstone to change it up just a bit.Welcome to Phoenix, Hillstone, and yay for me... first to review!Welcome to Houston's with a happy Hillstone hat on! One thing that always bothered me about the former Houston's was how dark and dreary it could be, but that is definitely not the case with Hillstone. I absolutely love the architecture, location and openness of this building. It's fresh and airy with plenty of large windows, an open patio, and rock finishing. The restaurant seating isn't cramped and you've got plenty of room to relax and enjoy the meal with those you came with and not 20 other strangers. Before I got to Hillstone, I read up on the yelp reviews and noticed Kat S's note about the ice cubes. So, when I sat down and ordered my Diet Coke, the first thing I glanced at were the ice cubes and Kat's right! They are old fashioned and pretty great! They are the type of ice cubes they place in whiskey to make sure they don't crush when they are dropped in, but I also think they make the soda pour without fizzing up. So now I will move on to the meal. The reviews are right in saying that this is exactly like the Houston's menu but with a nice improvement. I ordered the rotisserie chicken sandwich with the couscous. Warning: the sandwich is huge and way too big for one lunch, but that could be a good thing if you want to have the other half for lunch. We didn't have dessert but I glanced at the menu and while they have several of the Houston's signatures, I think they should add apple crisp to the list. I will definitely be back to Hillstone and think this is a nice addition to the area.I had a $20 club sandwich at the Ritz Carlton in D.C. I had a $30 lobster roll at Mary's Fish Camp in Manhattan.And this weekend I had a $19 French Dip in Phoenix.All of them worth every penny. The French Dip was pure perfection, served piled high on warm, soft bread which soaked up the horseradish cream and au jus served on the side. And served with some of my favorite fries. Skinny and salty. Much like myself so I've been told.Critics pan the limited menu. Boo to you. I'm so OVER Cheesecake Factory style menus. They scare me. I will say if they claim to be New American, I don't get that. It's American. Steak house style. And the decor! I could TOTALLY move in and not change a thing! The sandstone. The masculine wood panels and burgundy booths. And I love the photography, specifically the entire wall of swimming pool photos. Hillstone. Good move!i love this restaurant so much. i have yet to have something i didn't like.i have nothing really special to add to all of the amazing reviews except to order these things:thai steak noodle salad- mango, avocado, tomatoes, noodles, marinated steak...i meannnnnnnnnnnnncaesar salad - their dressing is my fav and so are the croutonsbacon, cheddar burger- so juicy, so exquisiteroast beef sandwich- raw horseradish on the sidefries- order extra bc people will eat these babies UP! service is ALWAYS good, it's always clean, it's always pleasant. seriously, you can't have a bad time unless you're just a miserable person.IF YOU HAVE KIDS YOU MUST READ!!!My husband and I have never been more insulted at a restaurant than tonight at the Hillstone Restaurant (Biltmore).This is the same restaurant group that includes Bandera and Houston's. We deliberately went out early-- at 5pm -- with another couple and our son. He started to fuss on and off during dinner. Mind you the restaurant was already noisy when the GM Miranda Geranios instructed us to leave; other patrons were complaining. That was news to us- and we've seen far worse outbursts in the past from children. Ironically, our son at that moment was playing happily with the other couple when she rudely asserted herself. We were in the middle of dinner and to add insult to injury, she didn't even offer to compensate us for a future visit without our little guy. Just go home without dinner and pay the bill. Of course, she herself has no children. To ask a repeat customer to leave is absolutely disgusting. We will never visit any of their establishments again and wanted to share our unfortunate experience with our friends who also know the challenges of having a family.Hillstone, meet the Hillstone...Have a yabba dabba doo time, A dabba doo time, You'll have a gay old time!!!   I loved this place!! The food was awesome, the service was incredible, our server was super funny and the vibe of this place was so relaxing and fine!!My favorite thing here was the Shrimp Coconut Sushi!! MUY DELICIOSO!!!!! Oh and the Ribs are a massive thing to behold, at first I though there was no way I would even finish half but I did, it was that good I guess that eating it was a very smooth journey of pure meaty goodness that I was able to accomplish to about 3/4 of the way that was because I was full to the heart!! We really enjoyed and loved this place!! We cannot wait to go back again and sink our teeth into another dish of pure goodness!! This place is a must for those who haven't decided to go on in!! Thank us later!!! :)  High five and an A+++I know this is a chain and found that there is one in SF. We ended up coming here for a late lunch after picking up the husband and daughter from the airport when they flew into Phoenix to celebrate my Gram's 90th. My mom had yet to come here and the fact that this used to be Houston's which used to be located across the street which well, everything that once was has changed in Phoenix. My mom ordered the artichoke and claimed it was one of the best she ever had. I had one of the best house side salads ever. It had all sorts of goodies from beets to goat cheese to hidden gems of avocado. Perfect. The husband had a French Dip he said he would fly back to have again and the DD ordered seared Ahi (she is much more adventurous than I) and loved it. Service was friendly, we left full and I look forward to another experience with Hillstone.IF THERE WAS A ZERO THAT WOULD BE TOO MUCH RIGHT NOW!!!  This star used to be at the 5 mark especially due to their salads, BBQ, and French Dip!!!!  Here's the story!    To give a little background about myself it is that I am married to my husband who is 70 and I around the 40 mark.  We are opposites in sight....He is buttoned up shirt and shorts and I am full sleeved tattoos and am more of a t-shirt kinda guy (The t-shirt in question is a cartoonish glow in the dark skeletal outline)  Don't get me wrong I do dress up well when the occasion calls for it.    On July 26, 2015 at approximately 1 p.m., my spouse and I had run errands, met with people and went home, showered and put on our CLEAN weekend work clothes.  We decided we wanted a good salad and the first place that popped into my head was Hillstone.  We get to the entrance door which was propped open by I am assuming the last patrons who had exited the building.  We walk in and close the door behind us.  We are greeted by a sweet smiling you woman all in black and asks how many; we say "Two please".  She says "Right this way".  We follow her up a slightly slanted ramp to a dead end and take a right to a standard table for four.  She places down the menus on the table and my spouse begins to sit.  As I pick my chair which was the one where my back would face the window and begin to pull it out to sit, the lady in black says "Do you have a different shirt with you?"  OKAY this pissed me off!  I turned around and shooed my hands towards the table in a "whatever" type of motion and walked out mumbling things I don't wish to repeat past 3 occupied tables, pushing the door open and realizing how embarrassing that was.  I understand if there is a dress policy (Which we did not see anywhere and later are told it apparently is on one of the doors as we entered, perhaps the one we had to pull shut.  If we were told I had "inappropriate" attire on when we walked in the door at the beginning I would not be so disappointed, hurt and embarrassed. On Yelp it states that the dress is "Casual" which could mean many a thing.  I am sure professional musicians who have stepped in the doors of this establishment have not even been questioned about the dress code.    I felt I was misrepresented as a client.  The worst thing you can do is make a person feel so inferior for the most trivial reasons and think it can just be categorized under an "oops" moment.  I am not one to play the "gay" card; however, I do feel that tattoos and the appearance of someone based on their tattoos is a different card altogether.....No!  It is a different GAME altogether!  I usually let things slide off and carry on with my day, but this was humiliating.  I don't care what people think of me, but I sure as hell do care about other people like me who have the same type of situations happen to them.  For being overpriced the food WAS wonderful!  I would take clients as well as family, friends and my attorney here to eat on occasion.  I think its time to look around for less judgmental companies to accept my hard earned money.Welp, I think it is safe to say that Hillstone really never disappoints and it shows by their long wait on a Wednesday evening! {Hint Hint: Always make a reservation when coming here!} Their service is spectacular, prices are great for the quality of the food and the ambiance is cozy and romantic. I have been getting their Classic Caesar Salad with chicken for YEARS and it is the best. I am also in love with their prime rib and loaded baked potato. The sushi is fresh and fabulous too, you really can't go wrong! I know we'll be back soon for another family outing!

I haven't eaten food from McDonald's in years, but I've stopped by this Mickey D's location several times recently for their ice cream cones... $1.64 for two ice cream cones... you can't beat that!  And they are reduced-fat too!For those that want something fancier, they also offer McFlurries (the McDonalds version of DQ Blizzards) with toppings such as oreo cookies, M&M's and Rolos, and sundaes with hot fudge, hot caramel, and strawberry.  As their slogan goes, "I'm lovin' it!"

Loved it years ago in LA....feel as though with any enormous chain restaurant, quality is suffering. Do I love that the menu is longer than the Bible? Or does it actually just drive me mad causing me to drive my salad fork into my forehead while perusing the ad-riddled pages? I'm always here for the comfort food. And I don't order those ridiculous salads, large enough to fill the salad bar at Soup Or Salad! Frankly I simply cannot digest all the raw roughage in one sitting. Cauliflower is no longer my friend. Yesterday I ordered the Hungarian Beef Ghoulash. Meet was very tender, gravy was too salty and the egg noodles that came with were a bit bland. I guess you need to ask for a gravy or sauce for them, cuz they was jest naked. Rickie's meatloaf, tasted just like my entree...I swear...I tasted no difference in the sauce. The Buffalo Chicken triangle thingy appetizer was different and tasty. Crispy, spicy triangles of lightly battered something or other filled with chicken. With so many newer places opening up all over town done in minimal/urban decor, The Cheesecake Factory really sticks out like a loud relative at a dinner party. Hmmm...will I go back? Probably...too convienent after movies at the Esplanade. And if I try everything on the menu eventually, I know I'll be navigating my walker with the yellow tennis balls attached, but I'm bound to find the fresh, consistent and comforting dish I so want.The cheesecake guys are the best. The cheesecakes are so great. foods and drinks are even better. the big problem is that you have to always wait and I hate that. even during weekdays that are not over crowded they keep you waiting for at least 10 minutes unless you only come here for lunch.

I drive by Rosita's all the time-- and have never stopeed to go in... until 2 days ago and I am so glad I did.  It looks really tiny from McDowell but actually it is a pretty decent size.  I ordered the good ol standby: beef taco and cheese enchilada and rice.  I was very pleased with my meal.  It was affordable and tasty.  I will go back again.  The only drawback is the pond inside-- things like that skeeve me out. Service was normal, food came quickly (like most Mexican food places) and the chips were good- warm when delivered and the salsa was great!Location, location, location...  Yes, the type of service you receive at Rosita's all depends upon where you sit.  My experience:  4 visits sitting in the bar = great service.  1 visit sitting in the dining room = painfully slow service.  So, the bar is definitely the way to go, and not just because it offers closer access to the margaritas.  ;)Now that we have that out of the way, let me tell you about the three main reasons I love Rosita's:Hot, salty tortilla chips with spicy salsa - the perfect starter that sets up the appetite perfectly for...Powerful and potent margaritas - the super nice female bartender is not skimpy on the tequila in these!And, best of all, the most wonderful carne asada burro I have ever experienced.  This is not your average burro with a bit of meat and lots of 'filler' - rice, etc.  No, this is an enormous tortilla packed with meat, meat and more meat!  If you get it enchilada-style like I do, it will be topped with a delightfully messy mix of cheese and red sauce.  Bite after bite of goodness!So, clear your afternoon (those margaritas pack a kick!), grab a friend or two and get going!Can I tell you how much I love this place! I am going to!!   The absolute best Mexican food in the Valley. I love the Chicken soup here. Nothing is better.I was sick with a respiratory thing and this Chicken Soup was my saving soul food.I stopped in to get it to go about 5 times during my illness. I drove 22 miles round trip and worth every step.My experience here with the food has been above and beyond our expectations every time. The food is fresh, and delicious. The Chicken soup is heavenly and if you do not feel well. It is all you need.The chips and salsa and fresh and wonderful!Cheese enchiladas, Chicken tacos(hard shell), and the Beef tacos,my favorites on all of these. It is family owned, which might be another reason it is so good. They really care about the food,how it tastes, if it is hot, and fresh.It is very clean here, as well as the restrooms. You must park in the back ,that can be a little tricky if you have a large vehicle. Just go slow. One way in , and one way out. If I could give them 10 stars I would.

We dined here on Father's Day. Surprisingly, a lot of others were also treating the "Dad" in their life to a legendary steak. I had requested a romantic booth not knowing that they didn't have such a thing. But we did get a small table stuck in the corner. While you don't seem to get a lot of privacy, you do get good service and a pretty decent meal. We started with a with a Crabtini to share. It's lump crab meat tossed in vinaigrette and served with Creole remoulade sauce in a chilled martini glass. Very yummy! As for our steaks, they were amazing. I had a filet mignon. It was very flavorable and cooked to perfection. This is one of the best steaks that I have ever had. For our sides, we shared a one pound baked potato and asparagus with hollandise. For dessert, we shared a crème brûlée with fresh berries. Very delicious. Definitely a very nice special occasion restaurant.

Review Text :
I SOOOO wanted to love this place as it is cute as a bug's ear. Not that I'm saying there's bug's here,  I just think it's a lovely, modern clean space, with lots of light. My friend was craving the Greek pita. "OMG...it's soooo good, you have to go get us some." So, I get our to go pitas (chicken, lettuce, feta and tomato), certainly not inventive, yet it sounded like it would hit the spot. "OMG....the side pasta is sooooo good, you have to get that." Fine. Two Greek pitas both with pasta sides to go. Oh, and the chocolate cake. He said to get the chocolate sheet cake. Well, let me just say kiddies, the pita was dry, dry, dry. Sauceless and dry. Did I say it was dry. Chicken was dry. Pita was dry. It totally fell apart. And then so did I. Dry. Dry I say. Pasta side was actually quite good, all 2 oz. of it. BUT THE CAKE...OH MARY....THE CAKE! Truly a slice of chocolate heaven. I will go back and try some other items. Staff was friendly. I liked the space. Cake was, cheap, like a penny or something.From the street, my husband and I thought Zoe's Kitchen would be like Panera - that is, we thought it would serve fast, flavorful, and good-quality lunch fare. None of these adjectives turned out to be an accurate descriptor. In fact, the food at Zoe's kitchen took 30 minutes to come out and was disgustingly bland and in a few cases, quite gross. We stopped in for lunch last week. The place was packed, but the line to order moved quickly, so we incorrectly assumed that we would also get our food quickly. More on that in a second. In terms of the menu, we were shocked at how uninteresting the menu options seemed. Even though the menu was decently sized and we are open to lots of different types of food and flavors, we found ourselves completely unable to choose and not drawn to any individual option. Even though I'm not a vegetarian, I prefer lunch sandwiches with no meat, so I was also quite irritated that the only vegetarian sandwiches were the grilled cheese and grilled feta. This is 2008, and the non-meat options at a lunch spot should be more imaginative than cheese slapped on some bread. In the end, I still ended up ordering the grilled cheese (nothing else sounded good!) and my husband selected the Greek Chicken Marinara. We sat down at the table, displayed our number card, and just waited. And waited. And waited. After literally waiting for 25 minutes, I checked in with the assistant manager who was manning the pick-up counter. She went into the kitchen, checked on our order, and said it would be just a "few more minutes." She even had a server bring us two slices of chocolate cake as some sort of  token of their sympathy, but it was super-dry and totally gross. Thanks, but no thanks. I'm just glad we didn't pay $2 for each slice!It wasn't until 10 minutes later when I lost my patience and told the same server that we wanted our food immediately that we finally received it. We have a higher-than-average awareness of the difficulties of working in food service, but we found it un-acceptable that a non-full-service restaurant would take 35+ minutes to bring us two sandwiches. If they can't handle the catering, to-go, and eat-in order volume, they should hire more staff members. As if the slow service wasn't painful enough, my grilled cheese was completed charred (literally burned and black). After one bit of the accompanying slaw, which was soaked in mayonnaise and soggy, I  immediately walked back to the assistant manager, handed her the plate, and asked her to refund me for my plate. To her credit, she complied, but the wait had already been so egregious that I wasn't about to just write the long wait and gross food off and decide to return. My husband's Greek Marinara was not as terrible but was still bland and completely un-memorable. The bread was a plain roll, the chicken breast strips were formed and tasted totally processed, and the "Greek" marinara tasted like Prego. The only tasty part of his meal was the side of bagged chips!I guarantee you that we won't be back to Zoe's Kitchen. We are huge fans of fast, casual, and fresh lunch food, but we found the food at Zoe's to be anything but.I went here despite Yelpers telling me not to bother.  What did I get?  An overpriced, bland sandwich, confusion at the menu, and feeling awkward in the location.  It's an uppity cafeteria that makes you want to believe that their food is good for you, but it's not. Don't make the same mistake I did!

Review Text :
Man, Madison is getting so many great new places that it is hard for me to keep track! The Tip Top Tavern is one of those spots I always drove by and thought "Man, what a dive. I bet It's great", but never got around to visiting. So, when I found out they had opened back up with a new owner, a food menu, and a new look I decided I had better get over there. Seriously, folks - what a great little place. After a bit of a rough start where-in I ordered a beer that I couldn't even look at because it was so awful  (the Dogfish Head T'weason Ale - what a disaster of a beer. They were super cool and replaced it with their house old-fashioned, which was one of the best takes on the cocktail I have ever had) the meal went really smooth - especially considering how crazy busy it was.Between the three of us we ordered 2 burgers, cheese curds, and the fish fry special. The burger was delicious, moist, and cooked extremely well. The coleslaw was tasty, but had way too much vinegar. The fries were crispy and free of excess oil which was nice. Apparently the fish was delicious as well. Finally - the curds. Oh man, the curds! They were seriously (tip) top-notch. Lightly breaded, crispy, and gooey with some nice tasting ranch on the side. These are the closest to perfection I have ever had. Hopefully it wasn't a fluke!Beyond the food and drink, it really was a nice space. The lighting was great, the decorations were were fun, and it just felt like a cozy place that I would love to hang out at on a Wednesday night to grab a burger and a beer.I feel like all I have done lately is write about how awesome the spots I go to are, but hopefully that says more about how great Madison is than it does about my (potentially) overly-optimistic ratings.Time for an update, as it's been 6 months since my initial review, and I've revisited at least 15 times since then.+ The atmosphere can't be beat. Love the space.- Still quite noisy; certain voices (and annoying laughs) seem to really carry here+ The staff is excellent; honest, helpful, friendly, courteous - truly professional+ Beer list remains nearly identical to what it was 6 months ago, and that's OK by me+ Several taps on nitrogen - yummmmmmm+ Now has outdoor patio behind the bar+ The food is superb+ Fried pickles - get them. (oh, and you're welcome)+ Sandwiches - all are outstanding+ Fish fry is very, very solid+ Onsite ATM with reasonable service fee- Cash onlyRemains one of my very favorite places to visit.

Review Text :
"2 stars for disappointing food, one star for great service."Had I read Iain B's review prior to my dinner at Desert Jade the other night, I could've saved us $46.  Instead, my husband and future yelper sister Alexa M and I headed down Indian School road in search for some decent Chinese food.  We were all pretty hungry and it was my bright idea to try a new place.  We passed by Shanghai Chinese and actually pulled into the parking lot of another restaurant (maybe China Village?) but decided since the parking lot was close to empty, that was not a good sign.  So, somehow we ended up at Desert Jade.Ivan was our server and he was fantastic.  I just wish I could say the same about the food... Unfortunately, the egg drop soup, Kung Pao Vegetables, Spicy Chicken, and Beef and Asparagus dishes were nothing to write home about... all were mediocre.Next time, I'll go to one of our regular spots instead... or at the very least, I'll check the Yelp reviews before wasting time and money.  You live and learn... they cannot all compete with Tottie's or Jade Palace!Sadly, I have not been impressed with the Chinese food offered here in Phoenix. I had high hopes for Desert Jade and was hoping the food had improved from Gabi's 3-star review back in 2009, but I was not impressed and it seems that the reviews range widely here. The three food items we tried tasted fresh, but were seriously lacking in flavor. The Wor Won Ton Soup came with a generous serving of shrimp, pork, and beef pieces and vegetables, but the wontons were dense balls of dough that, as another reviewer mentioned, tasted more like gnocchi rather than meat-filled wontons. The Beef with Broccoli came with the thinest sauce I've ever had that had the flavor and consistency of beef broth. The beef was a tad overcooked and the broccoli was limp from being overcooked. The Chicken Chow Mein was the biggest disappointment as I was looking forward to the big, fat soft noodles that I have enjoyed and every other Chinese restaurant I've ever dined!! The lady on the phone said "Pan fried?" when I ordered, which I guess I was supposed to know meant, "Be prepared for thin, vermicelli-type noodles." Again, no real flavor to the chow mein dish, though the chicken was tender. On the plus side, the service was friendly and the food was ready quickly. I just wish the food was up to par with the service.

Restaurant name  Niccoli's Italian Grocery & Deli
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
Roland hit the nail on the head here.... BREAD.  Bread is the most import part of Italian Sandwiches.  Niccoli's has it to perfection.  Everything about Niccoli's reminds me of my Italian neighborhood in Toronto where speaking in English was never needed at the local market, doctors, bakeries, service shops, or church.  It was little Italy.  Niccoli's has some of the best tasting food in town and it is locally onwed-- which is very nice.  PLUS, it's next to Burland Jewelry.... so pick up a Mortadella Sandwich AND some diamond studded earrings all  in one stop = HEAVEN ;o)As you walk into this friendly little Deli Packed to the ceiling with what you can expect to find in any establishment that calls itself an Italian style Deli in the heart of Manhattan. . . Only in the north part of Phoenix. The owner and his wife have been bringing this authentic NY experience to AZ for around 35 years. All the Cheeses! The LASAGNA ! The Garlic bread!I was making a "HAVE TO" trip to Trader Joe's on Saturday and pulled out my yelp app to see if I had anything worthy of lunch bookmarked in the neighborhood.  I did not, so I then searched and filtered based on highest reviewed.  Niccoli's came up, and it was settled.The parking lot, for the most part, was empty... but that didn't deter me from going in.  The smell that hit me upon entering reassured me that I had made the right choice.  Since I'm rarely in that neck of the woods, I ordered a meatball sub and an antipasto salad - knowing full well I would not be able to eat both in one sitting.  While waiting, I struck up a conversation with the female owner, who proceeded to tell me a story about a photo on the wall I had noticed of her and her husband, over 50 years ago, on the night of their wedding night.Just the fact that she took a few minutes to tell me about their lives that long ago while I waited for my food was worthy of at least four of these stars.  Then, as I was seated in the dining room next door, listening to Sinatra's greatest hits, the food came and it was out of this world.  Easily one of the best meatball subs I've ever consumed - the bread had the perfect chew - and wasn't soggy from the delicious fresh marinara.The salad had banana peppers, delicious olives, provolone, three different meats (salami, mortadella and pepperoni) and quite possibly the best Italian dressing to cover it in.  There were not many others who came to eat - but plenty were in and out for various Italian needs.  Their store is small, but appeared to have anything you might need for an authentic Italian meal.  Check this place out, whether you go for ingredients to make your own meal or want to try something they make fresh it's totally worth your time. If they're not that busy, ask about the beautiful picture on the wall and you're sure to hear a great story about Joe & Peppy's wonderful life.I have a serious crush on Niccoli's Deli and even though I don't live in the area, I will be sure to find my way to this little mom and pop shop as often as I can! I stumbled across this deli after reading all the raving Yelp reviews and having some time to spare before an event. I am so happy I had time to spare because it helped me discover one of my favorite delis! This Italian Market reminds me of someplace you'd find in a big city, but instead it's situated in a strip mall along 16th street. Upon entering, you're immediately welcomed by fresh meats in the coolers, fresh bread behind the counter, homemade raviolis waiting in the refrigerators and several rows of Italian imported products waiting for your kitchen adventures. I spent some time exploring each rack filled with exotic olive oils, fresh pastas, olive spreads, canned tomatoes and every other Italian product imaginable. First the owner welcomed me and led me to a reasonably priced yet delicious bottle of olive oil. This is after I accidentally picked up the $70 bottle of olive oil! Whoops. After filling my arms with products to make a homemade Italian meal, I then made my way to the counter and my mouth started watering as I read about all the sandwiches and menu items they offer. Unfortunately I was going to an event, otherwise I would have purchased a sandwich. However, I did purchase two rolls to make a sandwich later! During check-out, I began chatting with the owner's lovely wife who started giving me kitchen tips. She even gave me a recipe for a summer pasta sauce! She took the time to carefully explain the recipe to me and then wrote it down. I feel like I received a special gift! I've already tried the meal at home and it was just as amazing as she promised it would be!If you're in the area and want some delicious Italian products, or you simply want a tasty sandwich, this is your spot!

While I generally avoid any place with a sneeze gaurd, Rickie and I had a hankering for salad bar. And while we were smart and got our See's Candies first in case the salad bar experience didn't pan out, we were ready for 93 toppings to pick from. Upon entering I was impressed by the cleanliness of Sweet Tomatoes. Every station was stocked and ready for the pilling. I'm NOT here for a healthy salad. I want the egg, bacon, cheese extravaganza. I want ranch AND blue cheese. I want a difibulator!!!! All fresh. All pretty darn yummy. We had a Canadian Cheese Ham soup. Yowza! Good, gooey, salty...really, it was more like a dip. But we polished off that cup. They have pastas, desserts, focaccia, food, food, food. All in all my low expectations were exceeded by a good foodie experience!Being on a No Meat Diet makes you think outside the box sometimes when your accustomed to being an omnivore.....so, when we were looking around for a place to grab some lunch a friend suggested we stop by Sweet Tomatoes.  It has been over 10 yrs since I've been to one, so I thought why not.We arrived just before the lunch rush at 11:30 am.  There was a short line, but nothing crazy.  I piled a bunch of Salad and Pasta Salad on my plate and then made the rounds over to the Bread section.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/NZAxQxXH0YkSzPOKd_Nv-w?select=jRysLhaB-0yg5Wa2EYYQswhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/NZAxQxXH0YkSzPOKd_Nv-w?select=L3xqRAzbnoT7e2khkOUW6wThe food was very good, tasty and satisfying.  I went back to grab a small bowl of Mac n Cheese too, which was ok.I had a coupon for 2 for $9.99, so it was a great deal.  Overall, the meal was perfect and I left full.Return Factor - 90%

Review Text :
My favorite favorite favorite place. Possibly ever. When I was in highschool my loitering teenybopper friends and I used to get kicked out of here on a regular basis, but I don't hold that against them. We were idiots.cNstuff has been around forever and is owned by the nicest family on the planet. The minute I walk in there the smell of cheese (or is it sandwiches?) makes me instantly hungry. And there is lots of cheese. The sandwich menu is extensive and I always have the hardest time deciding what to order. It seems like there is a new sandwich added everyday. Do I want the Doe Boy or just a plain ol' Tuna? Russian dressing or mustard? Sub roll or wheat? For extra you can get a side of chips, potato or macaroni salad (which is a little too sweet for me). There is also a plethora of little extra snacks to fill up on, candy bars, twinkies you name it. Last time in there, there was noticeably less Swedish products on the shelves which was a little sad. Maybe they weren't selling very well? They were always enjoyable to look at. Anyway, please stop in to this delightful little sandwich shop, you won't be disappointed.Edited to add: German products, not Swedish. They were Umlaut-laden names so I got confused.Dough boy...dough boy...dough boy...Cheese n stuff may have a large menu with something for nearly everyone but I just can't walk in there and not order my Dough Boy. Top it off with macaroni salad and an iced tea and I'm all set.On top of being mildly obsessed with that amazing sandwich, there's much to love in their little space. The friendly family that runs the place is always smiling and happy to see you and welcome all guests... high schoolers on their skateboards, businessmen in their Mercedes, white collar guys in their beat-up pickups...they all are mingling in that little deli. I've yet to go there, and I've been probably 20 times, and not have the owners know at least one guest by name when they walk in.This was orignally a meat and cheese shop back in the day, hence the name, and they still have some deli products to pick up if you feel like skipping Safeway's. It's an old-school, quiet place. It's always nice to dine-in and enjoy the quiet atmosphere and feel like you're not in the big city for a short time. It may be hard to spot the store in that little strip mall, so just look for the Dairy Queen...it's right next to it.There is a lot of hype for this pretty average sandwich joint. My co-workers and I heard about this place through a listing of 20 great American Sandwich shops and it apparently even had an Oprah mention. After seeing these glowing reviews here as well I was pretty much certain that I would be let down in some way, but its hard to even imagine the reason for the hype this place achieved.It is an extremely tiny shop stuck at the end of the strip mall with central music. It's so tiny I've parked in front of it before and haven't even noticed it. The inside looks to have been renovated circa 1982 with faux wood paneling and shelving, and vintage boar's head advertisements that have been left to rot. The menu spread out across the entire wall on a confusing mix of chalk boards and computer print outs. The eating space is an extremely claustrophobic setup of folding tables and chairs stuck between the deli counter and the half-assed market shelves that sported international items that were mostly covered with a thick layer of dust.The actual sandwiches, solid quality deli stuff using primarily boar's head meats and cheeses. That's it? Why would you fall in love with this place? I went with five other guys who ordered a mix of their signature sandwiches (Doughboy, Bizmark, Manhattan), and all agreed you can get a similar sandwich at grocery stores and preferred even the likes of Sack's to this place. There is just nothing inventive about the sandwiches or anything that stands out here other then the friendly Mom and Pop ownership and sweet vintage sign.

Review Text :
This is an easy review for me... because the restaurant was accomodating, (we two business travelers arrived around 630p unannounced), the service was friendly and efficient, the interior is simple western motif, and our entire experience was both comfortable and delicious.We were staying at the Hilton Airport Hotel on the South side of the airport. When we quickly decided that a "petite filet and a baked potato" sounded like a winner, we hit the Verizon GPS. We only saw the name come up on our Verizon GPS, and we followed the instructions from the hotel, around the West side of the airport, and then East on Washington to the restaurant. I joked that if it had turned out to be like a Black Angus, or an Outback, I'd still be OK with making that our destination. We didn't want to go wandering all over Phoenix looking for a steakhouse.It's a historical landmark building, and we saw both business people and locals doing dinner. I really think it's what many of you guys call "a hidden gem." I say that because the location is in a sorta' bleak, industrial portion of Washington, just North of the airport. So don't go looking for a modern strip mall of fooderies. To me, the place looks more like the corporate offices for a rock quarry. But once you go past the copper clad double entry doors..... you'll know you're at a down home, upscale steakery!So, my simple recommendation is this... if you're in town like I am on business, this is a great place to take anyone! For the most part, steaks run around $30 to $45, depending on cut and size, and unless someone's cut out your tongue, I'm pretty sure you'll enjoy, or probably love your food! With a great bar and wine inventory, you'll probably float around $50 per person with one drink. Add app's and, well, the tab climbs a bit. And by the way, regarding your steaks... if you say "rare", then it's rare. And if you say "pink in the middle"..... that's what you'll get! Again; well worth what we paid.While I appreciate a good steak occasionally, I don't appreciate $9 baked potatoes.  I'm sorry, but if I'm paying $40 for a piece of meat, is it too much to ask to throw in the potato? This quirk has eliminated a growing number of steakhouses from my list of dining options.  I'm happy to report that Stockyards agrees with me.Although the area leaves a lot to be desired, I love that this restaurant is rich in Arizona history.  I love the building (check out the bar) and it's Old West charm.  And I love that it's still here after decades of change in the Valley.  The restaurant is quite large with several rooms.  Nice enough to dress up a little, but still comfortable enough for casual attire.  That's "casual," not pajama bottoms and bed head.  This isn't Safeway.My dining companion and I shared the Chateaubriand for Two (in other words, me and the dude I married ate a big tenderloin).  The steak was really good and perfectly tender.  It was served with the expected Bearnaise (which I didn't care for) and a house steak sauce which was better.  Also included were mashed potatoes, whiskey sweet potato mash, mushrooms, and "seasonal" vegetables, in addition to the salad, corn muffins, and biscuits served at the beginning.  A lot of food for $80!  The mashed potatoes were average (but they weren't $9), and the vegetables were a disappointment, consisting of nothing but julienned carrots and some broccoli.  The sweet potato mash was very tasty, however.  Did you know it's possible to eat sweet potatoes without marshmallows?  Crazy, I know.While I thought some of the food was closer to 3 stars, I can't help but bump it up to 4 given the overall experience.At the recommendation of a friend, I met a client here for lunch.  My client was arriving from out of town and this joint is very conveniently located near the airport.  I guess once upon a time, it was an actual stockyard.  Now, it's an old school restaurant that has a lot of character.After browsing the menu, I opted for a BBQ Pulled Pork Sandwich & Fries, $10.  To wash it down, I ordered Iced Tea.The Pork Sandwich was awesome, very tasty and a large portion.  You will get full.  The Fries were tasty as well.My client was impressed with the restaurant and put it on his "best place near the airport to have a lunch meeting" list....+++The service was great and we were able to have a good lunch meeting that left us both satisfied.Return Factor - 100%A flawless experience at this icon of old Phoenix, and a better value than most other premium steak places I've visited.In more cases than I can recall, a place with the history and legacy of the Stockyards would have fallen into complacency long ago, milking the same group of dedicated customers and giving less value to anyone who's not a regular. However, our visit was great from the moment I made the reservation. The menu is very traditional, and they've even played the retro angle by bringing back a prix fixe option that includes Steak Diane. We opted for the Chateaubriand for Two, and it was some delicious melt-in-your-mouth beef. No complaints on the service, either. As far as attire goes: It's a fancy restaurant in some ways, but remember that it's in Phoenix, and that it was originally located next to one of the largest feedlots West of the Mississippi. You won't look out of place in jeans and a polo.I wanted to like this place but the service we experienced here was awful and soured everything. It didn't start off bad, we made reservations and the hostess was friendly. She seated us promptly in a nice comfy booth and we received a breadbasket with crudités to munch on. When our waiter came to take our orders, we informed him we'd be ordering off the Restaurant Week menu and he made this face of dismay and haughty superiority. Apparently Restaurant Week offended our waiter? This is where it went downhill as from here on out, our waiter had an attitude. As a first course, we had the option of salad or soup. We asked if we could have Caesar dressing on our salad and at first the waiter looked upset that we'd make such a request and looked ready to refuse but relented and said yes. However we found out later that this was an additional charge that he did not mention to us. (Extra $10, really?) The salad was average, nothing to write home about. For our second course, both of us ordered the prime rib with creamed horseradish, which was disappointing. (Again, when placing our order, the waiter seemed really upset - like we were asking him to butcher the cow and then cook us the meal himself.) The prime rib was average thickness, about half an inch and a rather large portion, but the flavor was lackluster. Even the horseradish, which my husband loves, didn't help. For dessert, I ordered the chocolate mousse and my husband ordered the cheesecake. I wasn't very impressed with the mousse as it had a citrusy flavor - which was not mentioned on the menu and ruined it for me. (I like my mousse decadent - a deep chocolate flavor. This wasn't.) The cheesecake was good, but my husband would eat any cheesecake.Then, we waited. And we waited. The waiter had disappeared on us! We waited for a good 20 minutes before we saw him anywhere near our table. My husband had to flag him down and request our bill. Again, the waiter looked like we were asking him to chop down a tree, make both the paper and ink, and then write our receipt in calligraphy. After a few minutes, he came back with our bill and promptly disappeared again. We were shocked to see the extra fee for our salads, as it wasn't explained to us (we would have been fine if it was expressed to us) but unfortunately we couldn't find our waiter. Obviously we couldn't use our credit card (no waiter to process the card) and we had enough cash to pay for the meal plus tip. This is the first time we ever did not want to leave a tip but lucky for this waiter we felt so unwanted that we just dropped our cash and left.We won't be back.This is my go to steakhouse. Been here many of times and always enjoy my time here. This time we came here with a large group. They basically have a large main dining area, a smaller back group which is quieter, and the bar area. Not too many people hang out in the bar area so it's pretty quiet there. Today we got all the tables in the bar area so it was almost like a semi private party. They start you off with their jalapeño muffins and raw vegetable tray. Everything is so good but I always have to watch myself cause I don't want to fill my self up. Next came their seafood chowder. One of my favorites. It is so good. All I remember is the salmon in there but I know other seafood is in there. I ordered the 16oz ribeye with a baked potato. The ribeye was cooked perfect. Juicy. Not too much fat and just melt in your mouth meat. I'm an fan as you can tell. My wife tried the buffalo meatloaf and she really loved it. I stole a bite and it was so tender and smooth. Really liked it with that gravy. She had sweet potato mash and grilled vegetables. The veggies where cooked perfect and tender. It's a really good dish. To top it off I had the pecan pie. It's was good but I had better. Taking nothing away from this pie. It was really good and not to sweet with a nice flaky crust. Our service was great. Got our drink orders and always filled out glasses without being asked. We had one person at our table who had there steak cooked a little too much for their liking and they made no fuss about it and brought her another one while continuing to apologize to her. So I've been here and had multiple ribeye, prime rib, and baby back ribs and it's all really good. The reason I like this place is they give you so much for your money. If you go to those other steakhouse you got to pay for all your sides and appetizer. Here you get a soup or salad and a potato side. Well worth the money. Of course, I'll be back.

This is a 5 star pizza place period. There is no better pizza in the world. I live in California and when I'm in Pittsburgh I always stop here. I recommend the cheese pizza. Fiori's uses the best and freshest ingredients. Their cheese pizza is very flavorful. Adding anything else to the pizza takes away from the crust, sauce and cheese. Caution let the pie cool down a bit. It comes out burning hot. The subs are good here too.They've get a line out the door. They must be doing something right.

Restaurant name  The Inn on Negley
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
Without a doubt one of the nicest places I have ever had the pleasure of laying my head......having wine and cheese.......or breakfasting.The Inn on Negley is gorgeously appointed.  The individual rooms, all named for varieties of apple, are spectacular.  We were in the lovely Northern Spy.  The bed was wonderfully comfortable, the linens unbelievably soft and luxurious.  L'Occitane bath products smelled divine.  The Shadyside neighborhood outside of downtown is quiet but still conveniently located to all the Pittsburgh doings.Breakfast each morning, cooked by the hospitable Chef Jackie, is pure pleasure.  Each night on your pillow a menu card appears; check off what you'd like in the morning, what time you'll be eating, and drop it off in the dining room.  The next day, Jackie is ready and waiting with a fresh fruit plate, the pastry of the day, and fantastically strong and flavorful coffee.  Omelets and fritattas are made with local produce and eggs.  Irish oatmeal is served with milk from a nearby creamery.  Toast bread changes daily but is always whole-grain and delicious.  Breakfast meats are lean and filling.  Afternoons, iced tea and cookies are set out, and in the evenings wine and cheese served.  Enjoy them in a rocker on the front porch, relaxing on the back deck retreat, or in the privacy of your room.  Staff is not only eminently professional, but warm and gracious.  Heidi at the front desk was beyond helpful in making suggestions for what to do in the city or where to eat (I will be forever indebted to her for recommending what was probably our best meal of the trip at Soba).  If you ever find yourself in Pittsburgh, lodgings can't get much better than the Inn on Negley.That's probably sufficient gushing.Absolutely adorable!  On my quest to be a refined English lady I've been on a hunt for the cities best high tea service.  Probably not the most popular past time, but you can't knock it until you've tried it!  And... You MUST try this place!This is a proper setting for such an event, you almost feel like you need white gloves and a parasol!  And surprise, the Inn is actually an Inn!  Apparently it dates back to the olden days of yore (late 1800's) and is one of those old Shadyside mansions that was converted into an Inn at some point.  But if you have relatives who want something more unique in the heart of a vibrant Burgh neighborhood, I'd suggest here!Let's get to the tea service though!  It's served from noon to four daily, which is nice for a "ladies who lunch afternoon" or a Saturday or Sunday outing for mom.  It's in a parlor, which is small but charming.  There's also an outdoor patio that would be nice if it's not too hot out (drinking hot tea in 80 degrees isn't too appealing).  There's a full High Tea Service for $20 per person, which seems a little steep, but for tea service isn't too bad.  There's also other combo's for around $12, but I'd say go big or go home!The tea menu is VERY large and there were tons of choices. They give you the main choices between black, green and herbal, but you can also blend them together too.  I chose the caramel vanilla, which I guess is being taken off the menu sadly.  It was delish though... so maybe they'll bring it back at some point.  There were honestly a lot of different ones I would have been more than happy with too!The one thing I think is very cool and very different is that they offer you a different tea selections with the different tiers of food.  I've never heard of them doing that before.  Usually you get one tea choice and that's it.  I love that you can pair the foods together with different teas for no up-charge.  Very unique and a definite perk of coming here.  I've been to several High Tea Services and this one would definitely be on the light side.  The portions were small, but surprisingly filled me up for the entire afternoon until a later dinner.  I mean, it's tea service, not a five course meal!  There was a chicken and egg salad sandwich and a mushroom and cream cheese on a crisp baguette.  The winner was absolutely the mushroom and cream cheese choice.  It was amazing and I definitely could have eaten ten of those!  There were two scone choices of blueberry/peach and lemon/lemon ginger.  Those were actually surprisingly tiny.  I thought they were both moist and fresh, but I would have loved them to be a bit bigger because they were so good and I love to slather clotted cream on them!   Oh, and there was also fresh fruit.  Which is great and all, but more scone please!The last tier was the desserts.  Forgive me for not being accurate enough, but there was a delicious chocolate piece, cheesecake with lemon curd and blueberries.  Loved the chocolate, but I like my cheesecake plain.  While it was good it wasn't life changing.  BUT, the coconut macaroon was honestly thee best macaroon I had EVER had.  Again, ten of those in my possession would have been scarfed down in like 5 seconds.  I would buy a batch of those if I could!  Seriously, can I??I can't wait to bring my mom here, total mom place fo sho!  But I also love it for myself too!  Or for a bridal shower... If I could do another one (since I'm married I don't think that's proper).  But it's a great place, that's what I'm trying to say and I'll for sure be back to get my proper English lady on!

Review Text :
While I hate nailing a place that has so few reviews, I'm afraid I have to give this place one star.  Some of you might say, "well, what did you expect from a strip mall Chinese joint?"  Well, some of the best Chinese food on the West Coast is in a strip mall or even in a bad part of town.  Sadly, this restaurant is not only shabby inside and out, but their food is just as shabby.Their sauces taste bottled with a one-size fits all sort of technique:  pile on thick, gunky brown sauce on everything and call it Chinese.  Plates that are old and worn.  Dirty glasses.  Shelves that appeared thick with dust.  A faded "Best of Charlotte" frame on the wall that dates back to many years ago. It's sad to see a small business that just doesn't get it.  The food here falls short of the worst  Chinese food in a mall food court. That says it all.I don't think it was that bad.  I think some yelp reviewers over exaggerates their reviews and make it worst than it is. My colleague and I ate here for lunch because she recommended it. I didn't feel like eating Chinese food, but decided what the heck. I'll try this hole in the wall Chinese joint since they offer vegetarian options.I ordered the lunch special "Sa Cha Tofu" and a sweet tea. The total? $6.00. Straight up cheap! My dish was hot! I didn't know what Sa Cha Tofu was, but I was feeling adventurous, so I ordered it. It was good vegetarian dish that came with a complimentary egg roll. "Sa Cha Tofu" is basically a stir fry with Siracha. It's hella hot!  I didn't care for the egg roll though. I prefer the Philippine lumpia version 'cause the wrapper is thinner. They have a variety of vegetarian dishes here that range from $4.75 to $7.75. This is a great option if you are on a budget. They also deliver which is nice. I usually stay at uptown Crowne Plaza, so the next time I come to Charlotte I will order something here for delivery.

Restaurant name  Soba

Review Text :
Dude.  Pittsburgh.  Who knew you had such a refined and sexy dining scene???Well, your good citizens, that's who.  Which is how husband and I were referred to Point Brugge, Salt of the Earth, and lastly Soba Lounge, thanks to the brilliant hostess at our B&B who told us Soba was her favorite spot within walking distance.  I don't usually dine without Yelping these days, but I am *so* glad we recklessly heeded her advice.  Our meal at Soba was one of the finest, most delicious, and wholly satisfying that I can recall (joining Salt of the Earth, no less, in that prestigious category...).The subtle lighting and modern décor of the joint is coolly lovely, setting the mood right away for a relaxed dining experience.  Attentive, professional service is provided by servers who explain that most of the produce used in Soba's dishes is locally sourced and are happy to make recommendations.  Husband and I started out with an Asparagus Maki Roll appetizer, with tempura asparagus, tamago, roasted local shiitakes, scallion, and a spicy lemon ponzu.  The soft, sticky rice didn't overwhelm the crunchy asparagus, earthy 'shroom, and slightly-sweet tamago; the ponzu dip was a pleasantly sour foil.  We also had an order of Thai-inspired Blue Bay Mussels with crispy soba and aioli, which were *fab-u-lous.*  I eat a lot of mussels, but these were some of the most enjoyable I've ever had.For entrées, husband and I split the Soba Noodle Scallops -- which arrived at the table with root spinach, cuttlefish, wild mushroom, and fresh wasabi -- and the Seared Tuna -- with a sesame crust, cucumber-red-onion salad, kimchee, ginger fried rice, and peanuts.  Both dishes were out of this world.  Husband I had trouble cutting ourselves off at half and switching plates, but were both rewarded tenfold for doing so.  The scallops had a perfect sear, the soba was fat and chewy, the ponzu wasabi broth was soul-warming.  And the tuna was seared expertly, still gorgeously garnet and cool in the middle, complemented by a crunchy, nutty sesame crust and that flavorful rice.  I don't think either of us wanted that meal to end.  And all things considered, husband and I thought the bill at the end of the night was ridiculously reasonable.  Soba FTW.Pittsburgh, I have a crush on you.  Your perfectly-priced fine-dining scene makes me want to pull up stakes and move in with you.I've never been to Soba to eat a proper dinner. Only for drinks in their old bar. I remember it being tiny and pretty unremarkable. But now... wow! It's really a beautiful space. They must have replaced the lounge and the drink menu... because now it's memorable!We were sitting there enjoying the open air windows looking onto the street, as the slight summer breeze rolled in, trying to figure out if this was an unused space or a new building they bought. Either way, the expansion is incredible! I truly enjoyed sitting in the lounge sipping on some pretty phenomenal cocktails. I think sometimes I just assume Meat and Potatoes and Acacia are going to be the joints were I'm going to enjoy a stellar cocktail and that's it. But how narrow minded of me? I should be equal opportunity cocktail, right?! I loved the Docksider (silver rum, aperol, agave nectar, grapefruit bitters, lemon, basil). I'm super into any cocktail with grapefruit, because that equals refreshing to me, and less sweet. But what blew me away was the Rebellion (beet infused wigle whiskey, luxardo maraschino). I love beets, so if you don't, this may not be the drink for you... BUT I thought it had a light beet taste with just the right amount of whiskey. And those maraschino cherries. Geez. I could eat gallons of them!We also sampled some grub from the menu. The spicy noodles were very good, with just the right amount of spice to make my noose run (a sign of good spice). I could have used a touch more veggies, as the mushrooms were very good, but I find noodle dishes never have enough veggies in them. I thought the pork rolls were okay as well as the calamari, but really dug the yellowtail sashimi. Fresh and delicious. Like it should be! I want to try every single drink. So let's begin...Had the famous "Birthday Coupon" and decided to make it worth the free entree. This place has been on my list for a while, and I was finally able to convince my husband make the trip for date night. The only seating available without a reservation was at the bar, which is never a problem for us. We were two of the only three people there, and it was really quiet, so perfect!We were greeted by the bartender who was very knowledgeable and friendly. He provided us with drink menus and gave us an ample amount of time to decide. We started with the hamachi sashimi, which was a brilliant blend of pomegranate, pear, and avocado with amber jack tuna. A spicy little sauce was plated along with it, and the mix was really tasty. Beautiful presentation as well. My main course was the Thaikkal curry, which was a fun, educational dish for me. First, the eggplant was fire-grilled, which blended so well with the curry sauce. It was plated with bean sprouts and slices of fresh mango, which I had never thought to pair with a curry. The roti was fried, which I didn't prefer. My husband ordered the seafood hot pot. Quite a full portion of seafood with a side of rice, this vast array of shellfish went down quick. His comment was "It's Big Burrito salty."Really savory food and pleasant service in an atmosphere drowned in Massive Attack. That's Soba.

Four stars with a caveat, DO NOT ACTUALLY GO TO THE RESTURAUNT,---ONLY ORDER BY PHONE!  Inside is way nasty, it's old, kinda dirty, with an old man sleeping in a chair in the next room, etc. etc.Food was very fresh, full of vegetables and the chicken and shrimp were both better than PF Changs, IMHO.  I'll order by phone next time and forget that I ever went inside that place.

Review Text :
I stopped into Ritter's for breakfast this past Sat. morning at 11am.  Despite living two blocks away and having driven by many times, I'd never dropped in until now.  Given that I needed an inexpensive and convenient place to meet someone who also lives nearby, I figured it was as good of an opportunity as any to try it out, so I suggested it and we met for Sat. breakfast.Fortunately, my friend arrived 15 min. before I did and was able to secure a table, since Ritter's gets quite crowded on Sat. mornings.  Also fortunately, the interior is quite large, which is necessary given its popularity at peak hours.  Once I was seated, our server promptly took our orders, which was appreciated.  However, it took almost half an hour for the kitchen to get them out, which seemed long, given the amount of time that my friend had already waited, and that I've received prompter order fulfillment at other diners, such as the Dor Stop.Once it finally emerged, the food itself was pretty standard quality diner food--nothing to write home about.  Given that it was Halloween morning, I ordered the pumpkin pancake special ($5.99) with a side of bacon ($2.50).  I could definitely detect pumpkin in the pancake batter, which was nice, but I've been spoiled by the Dor Stop's pumpkin pancakes (which are available year round, BTW), and these didn't hold a candle to them.  The bacon was also disappointingly chewy, to the point that I didn't even finish part of my last strip.  My friend ordered the chicken sandwich, which seemed of similar mediocre quality, though I didn't try it.Overall, Ritter's met my standards for diner food, but didn't exceed them, and failed to meet them in some respects (chewy bacon--argh!).  One thing Ritter's has going for it is that the prices are quite reasonable; however, come prepared as only cash is accepted.  I realize that a lot of their business comes from inebriated customers late at night, so if that describes your situation, it probably hits the spot.  If you're willing to travel and are looking for a good weekend morning breakfast, though, I recommend the Dor Stop in Dormont or Central Diner and Grill in Robinson, both of which illustrate that diner food can be better than mediocre--in fact, it can be great!

Have you ever had a day, where you just didn't want to get out of bed at all?  I mean not even to go to the bathroom?  Well, if you are anything like Mr. Dallas G, you may ask, what could implore you to stay in bed all day?  Well Mr. G, the company of a lovely woman was number one on my list on this particular Saturday.  At about 1:30 in the afternoon, we both started to get ravenous.  I had been having cravings for Chinese food since about 11 PM the previous night.  My lovely bed mate suggested Go Go China.  I had never eaten here before and am a little reluctant to branch out from my usual go to Chinese place.  Once the stunning sack-mate informed me that they deliver and I would not have to leave the bed, I was sold.  She even went downstairs and got the menu! Goddess material, right?  We perused the menu and made our decisions.  I had the task of calling in the order.  A man answered and it was barely discernible what language they were speaking.  After inquiring about placing an order for delivery I was told that they would call back in exactly 6 minutes.  I began to question this, but the other line had already gone dead.  So, we waited the 6 minutes and by golly the phone rang.  I ask to place the order, but am first bombarded with what seems like a CIA inquiry.  After passing the interrogation I am finally allowed to place the order.  Sesame Chicken lunch special for me, which included wonton soup and pork fried rice, and Chicken Lo Mein with chicken fried rice and a pork egg roll.  We also got a shrimp egg roll.  I was worried when they quoted a 45-60 minute wait for delivery.  So, when the food arrived in 20 minutes I was ecstatic.  The beautiful woman next to me went downstairs to retrieve the food and everything.  From atop Mount Olympus she must have come.The wonton soup was really good, the fried rice was really good,  the Sesame chicken was really good, and the egg roll was really good.  The ravishing Ms. M next to me said all of her food was really good too. Overall, the food was really good.  The best part, aside from being in a bed with a gorgeous woman, eating Chinese food, and not really worrying about anything, the total with delivery and tip was only $21!  To this half-breed Jew, that is the silver lining my friends.   If you find yourself stuck to your mattress and are in need of some sustenance, call Go Go China, wait 6 minutes for a call back and get it delivered.  They truly did.

I don't understand the people who have caused the rating of this place to be so low.  I am not a Thai person, but I know delicious food when I put it in my mouth, and this place is great.First the atmosphere: This is a fairly small place with a warm, pleasant feeling.  It's usually not crowded, so it's not a bad place to go to have a little dinner conversation, and maybe get a little bit romantic.  Maybe move in close with your lover and get some kisses in before you order those spicy dishes.The food is great.  Fantastic flavor, good spice (I order 'medium' which is just enough to make me keep reaching for my drink), and reasonable sized portions.  A hungry person can go away fed but not bloated, and someone with a little appetite can have a little to take home!I pretty consistently order the Beef Drunken Noodles (without onion, because I am a lover and have to keep that fresh breath) which have incredible flavor, and are a dish which I haven't been able to find at a lot of other Thai restaurants.  I definitely recommend it, and if you don't like it then you probably don't know what good food tastes like!

OK so maybe I'm just a simple Scandanavian man, with an easily pleasable palette. But judging by other yelp reviews, my first FOI experience stands alone. I get a kick out of most Thai/Indian/Asian strip mall restaurants. The decor is pretty tacky. So, I tend to get my chow to go. I had the friendliest, most helpful lady guide me through the menu. We picked out a vindaloo, a tandoori, 2 orders of naan, some veggie fritters and a tikka masala. Vindaloo 2 starsTandoori 3 starsMasala 5 starsFritters 0 stars ughhh Naan 5 starsKing Fisher Beer 10 stars...can I do that?Service 5 starsFalse ceiling with stains 1 starTo go boxes and packaging on full display behind bar 1 starDecor...Bollywood meets flea market meets storage roomWell, as they say in India, um, hmmm...I don't really know what they say in India. So, I settle for see you later yelpers!I used to be scared...I used to be petrified.  I was never one to branch out with my variety of cuisine, which meant that I never had Indian food before...until a couple of months ago when I was invited to a dinner party. And at Flavors of India...my Indian Food cherry was broken.I decided to review this place now...since I have experienced other restaurants since.  I tend to always come back to this location.  The place seems very clean, I love the Bollywood videos that they play, and I love the service.  And I think that they have the best buffet!  Now, I am really bad at names of the food that I order there (which is why I end up at the buffet...I may not know the names, but I know what I like looks like)See me there at lunch real soon :)I'm finding more and more great places to eat in the central Phoenix area and I can add this to the list,  thanks to fellow yelpers Rand H and Mike C who invited me to join them for lunch buffet here. Seating is ample, with booths available. Lighting is toned down to a comfortable level and the TV screen playing Bollywood dance videos had the sound turned down.  I enjoyed pretty much every item in the lunch buffet. The main dishes were really savory; I especially liked the onion and cauliflower pakora. The  heat level of the dishes that were spicy was just right for me. The two desserts offered - mango pudding and rice pudding - were superb and an excellent way to cap a great meal. Service was very efficient, and the cost of the buffet was 10 bucks, tax included - truly a great deal.Yesterday was my first time trying Indian food (don't judge meeeee!) and I'm now HOOKED! Anyone who hasn't tried Indian food, or is curious and wants to sample - go here. This review is based on the lunch buffet, which beats out Chinese buffets any day of the week. You have a selection of 9-10 choices, plus dessert. The neatest part is the variety of food switches every day, so you're never eating the same thing over and over. Yesterday's buffet consisted of chicken masala (chicken, spices, tomato sauce cooked), daal makhani (lentil soup), bhindi (bombbbb okra!), chicken curry... and a ton of other goodies (dessert was shahi kheer - basmati rice pudding with almond and pistachios). My only complaint was the bread, as it felt like it was covered in oil. However, for $11.99 and all you can eat - I don't really care.Side note: they play this channel on their TV that's an Indian version of MTV - so freaking entertaining.

The Downtown Deli is my go to whenever I'm jonesing for loads of meat or a fat juicy dog. I've had every meat sandwich on the menu over the last 10 years and my favorite is the Skyscraper. Mounds of Corned Beef & Pastrami w/ melted Swiss, Dijon slathered on Marble Rye, with a side of French fries, a pickle wedge, and large Root Beer. I'm not a huge hot dog fan but I'll break down once in a while and go for the 1/4 lb all Beef Dog with Straw. It's a pretty darn good dog! The dogs go for around 3 bucks and the specialty sandwiches start at $8.25. But they are well worth it. Warning: This is not the place for people who are looking for a light meal or can't stomach a Motha of a sandwich. You will get dirty looks from waiting patrons and you'll throw the line cook off his game if you ask for a healthy alternative to the specialty sandwiches. Stick to the menu and you'll be just fine except for needing to take your belt out a notch; no harm in that.Ah excuse me? Am I the only one bothered by the way they make their omelette's here? I ordered breakfast here this morning and was mortified when I saw the cook about to place my omelette in the microwave to melt the cheese!  He was shocked when I told him to stop.I know Microwave foods has become an integral part of modern life, but you don't ruin an omelette by nuking it after you cook it in the grill. That's just weird.

THE BEST OMELETTE I'VE EVER HAD!!!!Saturday Brunch Review.You can custom make your own omelette. My friend who is a regular ordered mine for me. Her concoction consisted of bacon, ham, cheese, sun dried tomatoes, fresh basil, and pesto.  Wow, it was hands-down the best omelette I've ever had.The price was reasonable at about $10.The next time I'm back visiting Phoenix, Vincent's On Camelback is on my list of places to re-visit..

Review Text :
Welcome to Paris in the desert. Je t'aime Vincent's. Anything Vincent's does I love. Whether it's the 5 star dining in the front, the market bistro in the back or the Saturday morning marketplace outside. They really know how to frenchafy AZ. I've been to Vincent's Market Bistro several times and most recently, last night for a friend's birthday. The Market Bistro is the more intimate, kitchen style dining at Vincent's and actually my favorite way to dine there. I walked in and immediately felt like I'd entered a cozy and intimate restaurant in the heart of Paris. The food was cooking, the guests at the tables were laughing and having a great time and the waitstaff knew almost everyone by name. The authentic french decor helped the cause as well. When I hear the name Vincent's, I immediately think "oh yikes, here comes a pricey night," but the best part about it is that the market bistro keeps the evening at an incredibly reasonable price without losing the quality of food. Are you ready for this? I got the pre fix meal that began with a delectable crab cake on a salad with avocado garnish, followed by the lobster chimichanga and topped off with the chocolate tart which was really a chocolate souffle. How much? $20. Only $20 my friends! It was delicious. With each savory bite, I became a little happier. The wine by the glass was only $5-$6 dollars and at the end, the waiter brought us a couple additional desserts to make sure we tried them all. Just what my waistline needed...but I had a bite, and I think the lemon tart is my favorite. Vincent's Market Bistro has definitely been added to the rotation of favorite places to dine with character. And when I walked outside and the heat hit my face, I didn't even mind because I had such a great time at Vincent's.Id love to share with you my new go-to date night spot. It's filled with so much charm and romance we both were simply glowing with post dinner elation. The place, Vincent's Market Bistro is the scaled down version of the fine dining classic Vincent's of Camelback. It's funny that a place like this is so well hidden without even a hint of signage beyond a sandwich board on the street. Just look for the main Vincent's sign and follow it around back to the Market Bistro entrance, they're housed in the same building. Chef and owner Vincent Guerithault keeps the menu decidedly French with hints of Southwestern flare that he's so famous for. You should look this guy up; he's got some accolades including a James Beard award under his belt. Does kudos translate to good cookery, you bet! For one of my favorites, be sure to look for the Curly Endive Salad ($9) with mustard dressing, bacon, and a poached egg. I saw it, I ordered it, I swooned over it. A well balanced ratio of salty, sweet and sour then fresh cracked pepper completes the equation. Pizza offerings are done well with a tender pale crust that seemed more akin to pastry then to your typical chewy crispy offering. Tarte Flambée ($8) was topped with a light cream sauce, bacon, onion and thyme. Another pork laden pizza was the Caprese ($8) topped with pesto, arugula, mozzarella and prosciutto. I just wished that the greens were put on after cooking instead of before.For dinner you'll find classics including the cooked in its own fat Crispy Duck Confit ($16) with lentils and bacon, sensing a porky theme here? The tender mallard leg was succulent and intense in flavor while the lentils performed well by countering the richness of the meat. For something a little bit lighter, I use that word loosely, order up the Coq au Vin ($10). Red wine braised chicken served atop gratin potatoes were hearty and comforting. Vincent's Market Bistro also offers a $20, 3 course Prix Fixe menu. On my last visit delights were abound with the likes of creamy Butternut Squash Ravioli, Rainbow Trout and a scrumptiously sour Lemon Tart. This has to be one of the best deals in town that I know of. I mean really, food from a James Beard award winning chef at these prices is unheard of. Great food, good prices and excellent service all set in a romantic atmosphere, well; there is one caveat, the hours. Vincent's Market Bistro closes at 8pm, so plan on eating early. We arrived around 6pm on a Saturday night and by 7pm the place was completely filled. Be sure to check their website for times including breakfast, brunch and lunch.This place is a solid 5 Stars in my book. We took our N. Scottsdale friend here for her Birthday Dinner based on reviews from some friends on Yelp and were blown away with every aspect of this Beautiful Market Bistro. Once you find the entrance and park your car you walk up to a colorful patio decorated like you would see in a French painting by Claude Monet. You notice everyone there enjoying themselves with a glass of fine wine and a table full of tasty goodies. The inside is interestingly charming and colorfully decorated in the same eloquent fashion. Nice.We got there early to avoid the crowds and it was perfect. We were also greeted instantly and told to sit wherever we wanted. The server showed up faster than if I had a magic wand. He informed us of the specials while he got our drink orders going as well as bringing us a complementary plate of some of the best tasting buttery croissants I have ever had before. We asked a few questions and he happily answered us with no hesitation and was most informative.We started with the Smoked Salmon Quesadilla with Dill & Horseradish Cream for $10 and it was delicious. For entrées, the ladies ordered Sautéed Salmon with Herb Rice and Basil Beurre Blanc for $12.50 and Beef Bourguignon with Mashed Potatoes for $14. I selected the Seafood Skewer with Pesto Sauce and Scalloped Potatoes for $13 off the specials menu. We were all amazed at how nicely the vegetables were cooked just right. The fresh ingredients, textures and flavors were spectacular with all the dishes. Could not help asking for another plate of croissants to sop up all the extra juices and sauces since I was told by the wife not to lick the plate. When we thought we were done the server brings each of us a small plate of flourless chocolate cake topped with a mini scoop of vanilla ice cream and a drizzle of chocolate syrup. Yummo!We had such a great time there and the bill was very reasonable for the quality of the food and the friendly service we received. We will definitely be coming back again sooner than later. Fantastique!We've eaten at Vincent Market Bistro several times over the past year, and we never have had a bad meal.  The restaurant itself is very cozy and cute, the prices are very reasonable, and the servers and staff are really sweet and professional.  It's a great place to get brunch.My boyfriend and I both like the smoked salmon quesadillas and the 3 cheese tartine.  For entrees, I often get the herb shrimp crepe with avocado corn salsa, but my boyfriend prefers the crispy duck confit.  We both really like the sautweed salmon, too.The chef uses really fresh ingredients.  So, everything that comes out of the kitchen is really yummy.All the desserts are wonderful, too.  We usually share either the creme brulee or peach tart at the end of our meals here.

I was here with a very large group, so I'm trying to take that into account when judging the service... and actually the service wasn't bad. The restaurant itself had a bit of an odor to it near the front, but it was nice enough inside. Our table was next to a baby grand where someone was layin out some decent lounge. It provided an interesting atmosphere.The food... they had a lot of specials and it was really too much to keep track of - I come to find out they are 8 - 15 bucks more than a regular menu item anyway, so I abandoned that idea. I ended up with Fettuccine Alfredo with Chicken. The bread they gave us was good. For our first course, they brought out some potato soup for every one - including me, even though I said I wouldn't eat it... kinda wasteful when some of their dishes "go to feed the homeless" (whatever that means). They brought out a salad as well - I ordered a Caesar which carried an up-charge from the standard house salad of 3.50. The Caesar was drowning in dressing and all the salads just seemed plopped on the plate after being slathered in heavy dressing. At these prices with courses and such, I kinda expect a little more attention to be paid to presentation. As I said though, we were a large group and they were very good about getting our food out in a timely fashion.Our entrees were also drowning in sauce. My Alfredo was tasty and the chicken was really good, but the noodles were a little chopped up and difficult to fork up and it was a little too rich and heavy for me. I still feel kinda greasy.I think this place would earn 4 stars if the prices were more reasonable. We paid 85 bucks between two of us and that included a bottle of wine for 24 bucks (their cheapest red - which I had before elsewhere and was actually very good). I think this is a good place, but I think it sees itself as being better than it is. In some ways, it lives up to these self-imposed expectations and in other ways it doesn't. I liked it, but I didn't love it.Highlights of Christo's* The neighborhoody Italian cafe feel of the restaurant.* Decent food with run-of-the-mill upscale Italian variety.* Piano jazz player serenading guests.* Crowd with a decidedly old-money North Central Phoenix feel as opposed to the "I eat cat food and go to buffets" Sun City feel. * Professional servers with the memory of an elephant and the attitude of a menopausal woman.I had not been to Christo's in a few years, but upon returning I found the food and atmosphere to be just as consistent.  The restaurant is very neighborhoody and inviting. The white tablecloths and piano player in the corner set the mood just right. You see diners here running into old friends at the bar. I did as well.  Little old bitties threw their judging looks our way from the bar, since our table of 20 is young, mostly female, we must all be lesbians, right?   Right.  Consistently good food, not great and not excellent, but good.   Modest soups and side salads here are part of the drill.  I ordered the chicken limone, breaded and prepared similar to chicken picatta but minus the capers.  I tasted my friend's grilled salmon and penne and it was delicious. Considering out large party, the restaurant handled us OK, especially given the the busyness of the evening since it was Dining Out for Life evening where they donate proceeds toward HIV charities.I extended the benefit of the doubt, but expressed concerns over the somewhat long wait time.   It was nearly 10 pm when we left given our 7:30 reservations, in which we were promptly seated.  Our server,  who was skilled at reciting the dozen or so specials of the day, was accommodating, up until the billing situation (which I prepared him for beforehand) - when he turned a little catty, but all was well in the end. This is a 3 star place with potential for four stars.Christo's is OK if your into three courses in less than 45 minutes. I was expecting to dine here but it was much more similar to a diner experience were you get whammed bammed and thank you'd as we were in and out in a jiffy.My husband loves classic Italian Foods and according to reviews Christo's seemed like a top destination. Honestly in general the food was OK but not great and nothing I'd drive out of my way for. I almost never consider service as part of my review since it varies all the time everywhere but in this case it sort of even lessened the experience so MUCH that I have to consider it otherwise I would have given Christo's three stars.Our waiter quickly greats us and ask if we want the menu or the restaurant week special. Despite being around 70 years old he was very quick talking and very speedy and sort of made us nervous but what really bothered me the most was him  and his helpers standing there not to far from us with his arms crossed just watching us like a hawk eating the whole time. Now the food.I started with a Christo's Caesar Salad. I could tell the dressing was house made as well as the croutons. The dressing wasn't properly emulsified nor was it balanced in flavors and was super heavy with lemon. The croutons were crisp and buttery. I pointed out the faults since I know them but it really was an OK salad. I do note I wasn't offered fresh ground pepper, nicer restaurants do offer fresh ground pepper for Caesar Salads.I was sort of excited to have the classic dish Sole Meuniere here. The Christo's Version is nontraditional as the fish seemed heavily coated (maybe battered not sure) with flour in a lemon white wine sauce in stead of a traditional lightly floured and prepared in browned butter. The fresh spinach on the side was just plain without anything on it. Desserts seemed house made and were OK. We both liked the lemon cake better over the mousse.A glass of house wine was included with our dinners and during the meal we finished it and my husband ordered another round. He noticed a price difference from the menu and questioned our server. The server confirmed it wasn't the same price as the menu and said that for restaurant week they up charge the wine. It was only a few dollars but I feel this is bad business and not good for customer relations.I was really torn between two and three stars but the surprise of the wine up charge, being really rushed though dinner and with the waiter and his help all standing across from us just watching us the whole time in a unprofessional way sort of spoiled the dining experience.2.5 Stars

Restaurant name  Spinato's Pizza

Review Text :
I have an obsession with Spinato's pizza. It could have something to do with the sauce, or the homemade Italian sausages or the soft chewy pizza dough, but whatever it is, I just can't get enough. This past weekend, I finally had the chance to visit this location. We dined in the intimate dining room amongst families enjoying a pizza on the town. The service was on par, the atmosphere was nice but the best part of the night was the delicious pizza. It's so good I force myself to enter a food coma just to have another piece. The pizza is Chicago thin-crust pizza with fluffy and soft square pieces of pizza with their signature sweet pizza sauce that makes their pizza what it is. For pizza parlor pizza, this is hands down my favorite. I just wish they had one closer to where I lived!News alert: While there, I learned that they are moving locations in the next couple weeks, so before you visit, give them a call to make sure they haven't moved locations yet!

Review Text :
The atmosphere and the service made my evening with friends so much more pleasant that I will definitely be back. The food was good, the Mediterranean salad was amazing, that dressing was tasty and not overbearing, the orange chicken was well cooked but not as special as I hoped for, then again, I can't expect miracles from chicken. The desert (tres leches) was great, super sweet so not for everyone but tasty.We decided to check out Blue during the Dine Out Charlotte weekend since the menu looked pretty darn appetizing. We dressed for a night out on the town, and despite her dress and my shirt and snazzy dress jeans we still felt slightly under-dressed. Blue has the looks of a fancy smancy place and dishes out food that exceeds expectations.We arrived on a Saturday evening at 6 and were blown away the second we walked in the door. The place simply screams "swanky" with a sharp, classy interior and interesting dining room layout. The host and servers were extremely formal and proper, which only made us feel like we were somewhere we didn't belong. But enough about the ambiance...on to the food!After taking our drink orders (the wine list is like gigantic!) the waitress brought over some complimentary bread and butter. The bread consisted of a cheese focaccia which was warm and cheesy, and there was also a dark cranberry walnut that was equally tasty. The bread is served with a dish of kalamata olive butter which I'm always a fan of. I can't explain it...I hate olives but I love it when they are infused in butter!For an appetizer I ordered the caesar salad with pork belly croutons. The salad is served a la wedge and lightly drizzled with a caesar dressing. Alongside the lettuce was some roasted tomatoes (not a fan of tomaters, but the missus loved them) and carmelized red onion, which went good with the lettuce. But the real kicker was the pork belly croutons. Don't let the name fool you...these are not dried, hard chunks of pork. There was at least six decent sized balls of pork belly on top of the plate. Each one was deep fried to perfection, giving it a hot, crunchy outside yet retaining the juicy, succulent pork belly inside. It was like eating a deep fried ball of the white fatty part of bacon...it was just that damn good. This pork belly is not for everyone, but if you're proud to be a bacon fat kind of person, this little tasting of heaven is something you can't miss.The missus ordered the calamari as her appetizer. The calamari was kind of "meh", and the batter was way too heavy and just wasn't good. The plate also comes with some fried olives and hot peppers which she devoured in a heart beat. I wouldn't recommend the calamari since I've had better quality stuff at lesser restaurants.For dinner I ordered the bison osso buco, and it was nothing short of tastetacular. Six huge hunks of slow-cooked bison meat sat upon a bed of roasted root veggies. The bison was awesome, and I love getting it when it's on a menu. It was also refreshing to see bison as an actual dish and not just a burger. The meat was lean yet still moist from whatever magic the cook worked on it. The bison juices all mingled with the root veggies which consisted of carrots, potatoes and some others. Oh, and I almost forgot the spetzel! There's spetzel mixed in with the veggies and it was crispy yet chewy, and simply perfect. This was one heck of a dish and a great alternative for the steak lover who wants to try something new.The missus got the pan seared scallops, and these things were massive! The sea scallops were cooked to perfection and served with a great seasoning and sauce. The dish came with broccolini and other veggies that were SMOKED (awesome!) and a potatoe puree that was pretty darn good. Now the portions here are huge...you're getting a full meal, not a small fancy tasting. We both ate half our entrees and took the leftovers home for dinner the following night (still tasted awesome reheated!) We weren't fully stuffed yet, but we had to save room for dessert. I ordered the sticky toffee pudding, and if you have a sweet tooth this is the dessert for you. The toffee "pudding" is actually baked so it's more cake-like, and its served upon a sea of melty caramel sauce. There are some hard toffee chips sprinkled about to give some texture, and on top of the pudding is a heaping scoop of dulche de leche gelato that was awesome. The toffee, caramel and dulche flavors were all great on their own, but when combined into one mighty spoonful I achieved dessert nirvana. This is one of the best desserts I've had in the area, and there is no way I would go back here and not order it.The missus had the baklava for dessert and gobbled it all up. There was pistachio and pear stuffed inside this huge Greek pastry, and it was served with a side of marscapone cheese. Bakalava isn't normally my thing but I won't deny the tastiness of this dessert, though it was definitely second to the sheer power of the toffee pudding.Blue is a swanky place, and you will pay for the ambiance through your food, which isn't exactly on the cheap side. We would not want to pay full price for a meal here (simply because it's a bit out of our price range) but it would make for a tempting Restaurant Week visit.

Review Text :
It's quite rare that hubs and I give a restaurant (or any business for that matter) varying star ratings. In fact, I really can't name one other business we've been to where our reviews span more than one star apart. Therefore, I'm surprised to say that, overall, The Palm didn't knock my socks off. Was it a nice meal? Yes. Was it worth the money? No. And here's the why to it all.The place: The Palm Steakhouse, SouthPark, Charlotte-NCThe occasion: Our three-year wedding anniversaryThe channel of reservation: Open TableThe scene: Beautiful night on the patio, very empty on a Monday eveningWe made an Open Table reservation and noted that it was our wedding anniversary...it was a special night, not just a fly by for a quick steak. As mentioned, the patio is great although you really just look out into a wide driving lane that heads towards the Hampton Inn. Our server, Fernando, was top notch. Really, five stars for the service all the way around. Very formal but completely in tune with the cadence of the meal and the guest's needs. The food, however, is where I take issue...especially for the price.Beefsteak tomato Capri salad: 4/5: Big slices of bright red tomato with hunks of fresh mozzarella and basil. Props to Fernando for lightly pouring on the oil and balsamic at the table. Nice touch. Chilean Sea Bass: 3/5: The fish was beautiful - really a great filet. However, I knew it would be sauteed in a white wine butter sauce, not swimmin' in it. The delicate fish was sitting in a pool and drowning in the sauce. Goat cheese whipped potatoes: 3/5: Fairly tasty mashed taters, but nothing out of the ordinary. I didn't taste too much of the goat cheese and they required a heavy hand of salt and pepper to liven them up. Creme brulee: 2/5: As some may know, I'm a total treat monster and the creme brulee came highly recommended. The flavors were bright - light with just a hint of citrus, but the bruleed top was ice cold and the middle of the creme was also super chilly. I have a feeling this was refrigerated for a long time and the texture and temperature suffered. Other notes: The shrimp cocktail is $18.90. Are you kidding me? That's insane. Also, there is not a petite filet...only a 9 oz. option for $43. This served as the reason why I went with fish instead of steak. I did, however, try a few bites of hubs' steak and it was cooked perfectly and was very well flavored. Additionally, I was a bit surprised that, considering the great service, no one wished us a happy anniversary in any way. Overall, our meal for two people, with a few drinks added in, came to $200. I'm completely fine shelling out some coin for a great meal, but The Palm fell short for me.

Review Text :
This is easily one of the best if not THE BEST happy hour value in the Valley.  I hold Caffe Boa very highly in that regard too.I was a regular for McCormick and Schmick's happy hour in Downtown LA.  Since moving to Phoenix, I seem to forget it's even here, in it's hidden Esplanade office tower location.Five appetizers are $1.99 and another handful are $4.99.  Their claim to their happy hour fame is the 1/2 pound angus burger.  The Angus burger, which comes with steak fries, is decently sized and pretty good for $2 bucks.  Not the best burger I have ever had, but good considering the chump change you pay, it's a steal. Bobo and I splurged and ordered enough food for everyone in the bar, where you could just about hear a pin drop.  The calamari strips and grilled salmon cakes were pretty good too.  Bass and Hef on tap are $5 each.Granted we were also there at 9 pm for their reverse happy hour, (which is another added bonus) and watched as the last of the douchey corporate expense account 24th and Camelback crowd dwindled.Service by the outgoing server Teresa was solid, and if you're even remotely in the area, I highly suggest it for some good cheap fun post-work.If it wasn't for the happy hour it would probably be a three star place for the corporate seafood chainey feel.I usually have a hard time persuading Mom to join me for a restaurant meal.  Not so when I bring up seafood at McCormick & Schmick's!  We both enjoy the sour dough table bread and butter that is only given when requested.  Lunch items are decent in prices and portions.  I find that the dayshift staff here are more friendly and efficient than the night shift.  The lunch meals flowed very smoothly: glasses always full and extra hot bread brought to the table when asked (w/out our having to repeat ourselves).  Happy hour and dinner services are something else entirely.I don't deny that happy hour apps are nicely priced.  I've only experienced HH here once, and it took awhile before I found a table I wanted to sit at (outside was noisy and smoky, and the only chairs available by the bar inside were at the ends).  It took quite some time before my server arrived.  I usually only order HH apps since I rarely drink, but she told me I had to order a drink, any drink that costs at least $2.75, before I could take advantage of the HH app specials.  So I ordered my first (and so far, my last) Arnold Palmer, which is a beverage that is half-tea and half-lemonade.  For apps, I tried the clam strips, fish tacos, and the cheeseburger and fries.  I thought the clam strips were too bread-y: not much clam-meat, just batter and seasoning.  It tasted pre-frozen.  The fish tacos were decent, but not filling.  The star app here were the cheeseburger and fries!  The burger was HUGE!!  The fries were numerous in quantity, too!  The pleasant surprise in the value of the burger and fries mitigated the disappointment I felt over the clam strips.  One huge complaint, however, was the fact that my server only saw me once, and that was to get my drink and appetizer orders.  She never came back to check on whether I would like another drink or something else from the HH and dinner menus.  Mom and I had dinner here last night (Saturday).  I couldn't believe how dead it was, considering it was only 8:15p.  We already knew we wanted to order the Dungeness crab and shrimp bisque for her and the mixed grill special for me (salmon, seabass with coconut rice and asparagus, and the shrimp-crabcake, which Mom could have since I have a shrimp allergy (sob!  I LOVE crabcakes!).  The mixed grill entree also comes with creme brulee!  Mom wasn't sure which size soup to order, but our male server told us that the cup was very small in portion, so I asked for the bowl (which, in the end, was too much).  We also asked for bread, which thankfully arrived within a few minutes.  The soup took another ten minutes.  Mom didn't think it was anything special.  Indeed, she thought that the Red Lobster bisque we enjoyed in Illinois years ago was much better.  I do remember the bread bowls of deliciousness from years past; we loved the chunkiness of the RL bisque, as well.  I told her that the higher-tabbed venues seem to serve less-chunky and more silky-smooth pureed bisques (we both agreed that chunky bisques are the best!). The mixed grill took more than 40 minutes from the time I placed the order, which is unacceptable.  Grilled seafood doesn't take long to cook!!  The entree was very delicious, though, but I would be hard-pressed to order it again if it is going to take this long to prepare.  I was also disappointed to see that the coconut rice contained *.  I LOVE *, but my immune system doesn't, and nowhere in the menu description was it mentioned that * were included.  Mom took the tainted half, but I still ended with vertigo and painful abdominal cramps from eating the "clean" half (it seemed like the rice was pre-molded in a tiny bowl or ice-cream scoop with the * in the bottom of the mold, and then placed onto the plate).  The * looked beautiful in the presentation (and Mom thought the rice tasted fine), but had I known sooner, I'd have requested them to be omitted, or at least be placed on the side.  I loved the salmon and the seabass, which were perfectly seasoned, but I found the rice too squishy, as if too much liquid was used.  The sticks of asparagus were perfectly crunchy and great in flavor!  Mom absolutely loved the crabcake... I was so jealous!  Service was objectionable: long waiting time, 2nd request for bread was forgotten, and the wait times for the seafood, brulee (yum!), and ticket were too long in between.Hope to give a favorable happy hour update!  I'd like to try some of those grilled salmon cakes Stevie P. mentioned.  I'll have to take everybody's word on the margaritas' goodness... Not much of a drinker to justify my spending $10 on one drink.  (Although, Roy's Hawaiian Martini is definitely worth paying $10 for... so smooth!)Sat at the bar and had Byron, nice guy, waiting on me.  I wasn't too thrilled when I saw that the $5 happy hour red wine selection was a Penfolds (?) cab/shiraz blend, but Byron said it was good, so ordered it.  (I'm not fond of shiraz...)Chose the deep-fried zucchini and the blackened cajun-spiced chicken sandwich with fries off of the $1.95 menu, with the chicken sandwich selection entered first.  It's a good thing I added the zucchini, as it arrived much earlier than the sandwich.  I'd already polished the dish off (nice, light, crispy coating of panko with a side of rather tasteless ranch dressing), as I ended up waiting another 8 to 10 minutes for the sandwich to arrive.  The sandwich was good (loved the spice rub!), allthough I had to throw away the **.  Still a good-portioned meal without the omitted items, as it came with a side of fries.Didn't feel comfortable enough to take photos of the food... Don't know why as I usually don't let what others think influence my actions, but there you have it.  I think happy hour at Roaring Fork's spoiled me a little bit...11/25/102.5 stars.Wasn't able to secure a reservation at either Chandler's or Ahwatukee's Mimi's Cafe, but I did have two reservations at Rustler's Rooste and McCormick & Schmick's.  Mom didn't relish the thought of having to dine outside at RR's, so M&S it had to be.Reservation was for two at 8p, and knowing we'd be slightly tardy (we arrived at 8:05p), I'd called before we left and was told that there wouldn't be any problems keeping the reservation.  It took about 10 minutes to be seated, which wasn't so bad, considering that the hosts seemed disorganized and slightly frantic, and there were about 10 or more people waiting in a scattered formation before us (it was VERY cold outside, and no one wanted to feel the breeze everytime someone opened the doors!).  However, it took another 15 mins. before our server greeted us, which also meant we had to wait that long before getting a sip of water!Food was, on the whole, delicious (w/ a few exceptions), but it was the timing that ruined the experience for us.  After being served water, we both ordered the Turkey dinner, each w/ a choice of side (Mom chose the sweet potato crumble, and I the macaroni and cheese), plus a side salad and dessert (cheesecake or upside-down apple pie- we both chose the pie).  Mom also wanted the calamari app.  How I wished I'd listened to our server when he recommended the crumble over the mac 'n cheese after I'd asked him which was better :(  The SPC was heaven (!), while the mac needed more cooking time.  Even the replacement wasn't any good.  The sliced oven-roasted turkey dinner was terrific, which included mashed potatoes, stuffing, fresh cranberry sauce, crispy green beans, and sliced carrots.  We were served cheesecake, instead of apple pie, and when we nicely pointed out the mistake, we were told that the apple pie would take a little longer as it was still baking, and the cheesecake was taken away.  Mom didn't care for the pie; I, on the other hand, really liked the homemade filling!Run-down of the timing of food delivery:8:25p- Water and server greeting.8:35p- Salad and app. delivered.9:25p- Turkey dinner entrees arrived.10:10p- Cheesecake slices placed on table and taken away shortly after.10:40p- Upside-down apple pie slices presented.10:55p- Credit receipt delivered and signed.As I mentioned above, food was solid (w/ exception to the mac 'n cheese and cheesecake mis-step), but service was extremely lacking.Even the women's restroom needed dire attention... Perhaps M&S' 4th year of T-day dinner will be more successful (I think this was the 3rd year since they first offered it), but I won't be back to find out.  Next Turkey day dining out, I'll make sure to place my reservation at Mimi's ahead of time!

Just not "all that".  Pretty much bar food.A yelper recommended this place as being the BEST cheesesteak in town.  Sadly my cheesesteak ...  was .... well ... just a pretty good cheesesteak.  I guess I don't know how you can screw up or enhance such a thing so I don't know what I was expecting.The atmosphere is straight up sports bar and they seem to dress their waitresses in "Hooters-esque" tops ... not my thing.  Not a bad place ... just "there".Memories, pressed between the pages of my mind ... Memories, sweetened thru the ages just like wine...Oh the memories this Uncle Sam's has for me. My entire extended family used to use this as our impromptu reunion spot when I was a wee child.  We still meet up here on occasion for nostalgia's sake.My two female cousins used to torture me and I would end up in the bathroom crying every single time. That is until I called my cousin a hooker. Nobody knew what it meant, but it stopped their constant berating so it did the trick.I cannot imagine a better happy hour. Pitchers of premium beer are $2.99 and their food is like $3. You can get a bud light on draft for $0.75 if you are into that sort of thing.I always get the cheese hoagie (Cold) with the sweet peppers. Delish. Everything here is good, though, including the pizza, fries, and mozzarella sticks. The only reason they don't get a five is because they have horrific service. Sorry, it's true.Come. Enjoy. Watch Football. Play the Vintage Pacmen Game. Just don't let your cousins torture you for five years.. just call them a hooker from the get go. Trust me, it works.That awkward moment when you realise that you get what you pay for. I actually use to really like this place. Great happy hour. Good flavors on the wings. I guess the awkward part of it all is that I'm not 23 anymore and my expectations are higher than they use to be. Like tonight, for example. I placed an easy order of happy hour wings and a brew. Well... no. I got a full order. When I informed the server ( young red head with tats behind her ears and plugs) that I only ordered a small order of wings, she offered to get me a box. I figured this was so she didn't have to get management involved with the switch or what not, despite my eager suggestion. Needless to say, the evening continued. I eat one wing... literally one! A cockroach walks onto the bar. It was small and may have been a beetle, but still... ew! ! There goes my appetite!  Words of advice.  If you do decide to come to good ol' Unc' Sam's, wear protection. Serves with mediocre at best. The gals working there are 12, so I don't expect much I suppose. However,  the Peoria location is much better and cleaner ( it seems like). I'm only giving two stars because of the cheap beer and the decent wings. Not good!!! Just decent. I think the beer helps. Long story short. If you have a party and want cheap cheapness... well then you've found... omg... an other cockroach just walked up on the bar! Are you absolutely kidding me!? Im seriously about to freak out and walk out. I don't care if I haven't paid. This is embarrassing!!! DO. NOT.  EAT. HERE!!!

Meskerem is to Red Sea as Harris Teeter is to Food Lion. As in, less atmosphere, spottier service, but good deals and (in some cases) surprisingly good food. A complaint I often hear about Ethiopian is that it all tastes the same - whether that's actually true (I don't think so) or it's a result of our western minds being so used to each separate dish having, well, it's own, separate dish, that when it's all piled onto a delicious piece of Injera, the way we experience flavor shifts is a mystery to me. At Red Sea, there is no mistaking Wat for Alicha - the flavors in each dish (even just stewed lentils) are distinct. Some things are sweet - others salty. And there's none of this "spice level" stuff - you get the full range, when ordering a combo (at 10.99, veggie combo is a steal).Dings - nuked Sambusas. Service was both good (presence, smiles) and cranky (unhappiness about splitting a bill 3 ways, each portion on a card). Warm, as in tired A/C. But really good, thoughtfully prepared food. Lovely.

Why on earth would anyone come to this location?  I don't know where to begin with my issues with this establishment.  From the salad bar that needed maintenance to the restrooms.  This is a place with kids, most of the them under the age of 12, the bathrooms need to have a regular schedule for cleaning and restocking, especially on the weekends!  Kids in general are messy, but now you have a couple hundred running through a restroom, it needs to be cleaned regularly.I was so disappointed to see that the staff only appeared for the birthday party and to drop off food, but when I looked around, I only saw one person out sweeping and trying to clean up and the person at the entrance.  Other than that, I would occasionally see a person come from the back and look around and go back to the back..  You have kids running around wildly.  Everyone at work that's not cooking should be out trying to man the restaurant floor.  Hand sanitizers ran out in the play area, but people working there were waking around doing nothing.I will return if a kid I know is having a party there, but I won't be eating the food.

Well I am probably going to be pretty unpopular with this review but sometimes you just got to have your say. I find it astonishing that most people criticize places like this because it is not "authentic". I understand what they mean but please. This is Phoenix Arizona. Not Bangkok or Chang  Mai, Thailand. And I'll be honest. I've been fortunate enough to spend time in Thailand and the food really didn't appeal to me as much. Same with Indian food. The Indian food in London is stellar. A really special blend of different regional fares. In India? It seemed pretty ordinary.So yes, I am making a crazy statement. That possibly the most "authentic" food might not actually be the most interesting.With that ridiculous statement made, I love this place. Yes, I agree the place runs with the efficiency of a zoo sometimes. And sometimes the wait staff need a good kick up the arse. But for the most part, the food is excellent. Tasty and satisfying. Every now and then a dish comes out ill prepared. But I've had that experience in many places, bar the expensive ones.So forget trying to frame the place against "the real deal" and enjoy it for what it is!

Let me start with I have seen cleaner homicides than their bathroom /: I should've left but I was starving. Place not even busy stood there for 5 minutes to get ask "what you want?" I ordered sausage croissant meal w coffee to go.The sandwich cold, the hash browns hard enough to break a tooth.I know its fast food but come on. Now sitting at dr office starving.NEVER AGAIN BKYeah, I know. It's Burger King. It's a chain. But I've got this veggie burger fix list, and honestly, the BK Veggie is my default when I'm also in a hurry. I mean, it's quick, it's easy, and BK's the only fast food place that's got a veggie burger. I mean, it's Morning Star, they can't fuck it up. Stick it in a bun, throw on some mayo, some ketchup, some lettuce, you're good to go. No cheese - you gotta ask for cheese, and I'm sure they charge extra for it, like 20 cents or something. I just spent like 5 minutes looking for the cent key on my keyboard btw - wtf? What happened to the cent key? Didn't there used to be a cent key on keyboards? Over the 6, right? Is it a Mac thing? Do you have one? I just got this effin arrowhead looking thing.. ^ WTF?

I stopped here after a friend recommended the place for steaks. Impressive selection! There were several cuts that are pre-marinated. The prices were extremely cheap compared to other places such as Metcalfs.To compare, I spent almost $60 on steaks for 6 people and bought the same amount of meat here at Ken's for $20...and they were marinated. I tried the burgandy peppercorn steaks...WOW!! These guys melt in your mouth!Usually leftovers steaks are tough but after several days in the fridge, the leftover steaks were still as tender as the day they came off the grill. I'm doing all my meat shopping here from now on!

This is first and foremost a neighborhood DIVE BAR. However, it is a dive bar with old school charm, style, and personality. The food here is shockingly good. The wings I ordered were fantastic - they grill them AFTER they apply the hot sauce to impart a less slimy texture. I sat at the bar and watched burger after delicious burger roll off the grill - I will be trying one of those on my next visit. Downside: it was warm, and the bathroom needs serious help! Note: It gets really packed around dinner time and the service can be slow - so take a deep breath, relax, and they will get to you in good time... I really enjoyed the change of pace.Jt's Bar & Grill is exactly what I have been looking for in the Valley! Neighborhood dive bar where everyone seemed to know each other, insanely friendly service (shout out to Kerri!) and killer bar food and chicken wings of epic proportions! I am a chicken wing connoisseur, and frankly Jt's may have the best chicken wings I have EVER had! They deep fry those baby's, sauce em and throw them on the grill. They have several choices of sauces the best was the works which featured all of their sauces mixed together minus their suicide sauce which produced a delicious and not too spicy wing! I like my wings ultra spicy so I ordered a side of the Suicide sauce, which I personally loved - definitely spicy but not so that your mouth is on fire. Their wings will set you back $7.50 for a dozen ( Which makes me love this place more!). They have a pretty large beer selection on tap and every liquor you would want! This place is def going to be apart of my repertoire and it should be for you too!

Very Cute and Cozy Place! The Food was AMAZING! Seriously I have been thinking about it all day and whether my diet likes it or not I'll be returning very soon! I got the Appetizer Platter which came with a Pupusa, a chicken meat pie, a chicken tamale and beans. (see pics) Everything was wonderful and fresh and oh so Delicious! I would have to tell anyone who has never had this kind of food, do not be intimidated, go for it you won't be sorry, my particular meal wasn't spicy or greasy it was just the best thing I have tasted in weeks and it's definitely budget friendly!

You know how JImmy Buffet has Cheeseburger in Paradise? Mine is more like Pancake in Paradise and this place is it! While Pamela's serves up the amazing thin crepe-like pancakes, The Dor-Stop serves up the fluffy equivalent. The list of different combos goes on and on. And if you're with a really good friend, you can order two different ones and split them! Genius!I split the banana chocolate chip pancakes and the pumpkin pancakes. While the pumpkin was incredible, I think I slightly more enjoyed the banana chocolate chip just because the combo is such a winning one! But come fall, I may be all over the pumpkin ones again. Although, I'd probably be cheating myself because I have to work my way down the list of them all!The only thing that would pull me away would be the french toast. It almost seems cruel I have to choose between the two! And it's so dirt cheap too! I think for three people it was around $25 bucks. With coffee and some sides! I think there's some other stuff on the menu, but who knows if I'll ever even experience them... how can I with those pancakes!Ok, so I know this place is somewhat of an institution now because of their Food Network exposure, but I'm going to have to go against the grain here and say that I did not enjoy my Dor-Stop experience.We came here many months ago after hearing all of the hype. I'd never been to Dormont before and we were eager to check out this place and the neighborhood in general (side bar: Dormont is adorable! If it were a bit more convenient to where we work and like to play, I would totally live there). Anyhow, so we get there on a Saturday morning, and the place is packed. No biggie, most good breakfast spots usually have a wait on a weekend morning. I think we waited about 30 mins, which wasn't bad. We're seated, we order, everything is just peachy. Then things started to go sour.It had been about 40 minutes since we were seated and we still hadn't received our food. Other diners who were seated after us had received their food and were finishing up. Our waitress hadn't stopped by our table in a long time. I had started to wonder if maybe our ticket was lost (ordinarily I wouldn't think anything of it, but the fact that people seated after us had gotten their food made me think something might have been wrong). Anyway, so the next time we see our waitress walk by, we flag her down and ask her if she knew when our food would be out. We asked politely. We weren't snarky, we weren't mean, we didn't roll our eyes or snap our fingers. It was a simple question, one that I think many would probably ask. And the waitress replied, "Are you really hungry or just really impatient?" No hint of a smile on her face. No twinkle in her eyes. It was clear that she wasn't joking (not that it would have been funny anyway). Hmm. Are we really hungry or really impatient? Well, neither...we just wanted to make sure our ticket hadn't gotten lost. We sat in stunned silence, unsure of how we should respond to such a flat-out rude remark. The waitress left, and finally brought our food out about 10 minutes later (and then we never saw her again except for when she dropped off the check). By that point, our appetites were pretty much gone, and we just wanted to leave. So we scarfed down our food and got the heck out of dodge.I dunno. Maybe the waitress was having a bad day. Maybe she gets asked that question a lot (by actual impatient people) and is sick of hearing it. But we were very polite to her and didn't deserve to be treated like that. I don't care how good your food is (and for the record, the food was okay, but certainly not mind blowing for the all the hype), if you have lousy customer service, I can't support you. And it's a shame, because I really, really wanted to like this place (it looks like such a cute mom and pop place). With so many other great breakfast spots in the Burgh, I'd rather go somewhere that cares about giving their customers a good (or at least not a blatantly bad) experience.Well, looks like I'm adding yet another 5-star review for Dor-Stop. But hey, they definitely deserve it! In fact Dor-Stop is so good that I came here two days in a row a couple weekends ago - once for a sit-down meal, and once to get a meal to-go just so I could try a second item on the menu.I actually hadn't eaten at Dor-Stop in years until earlier this month - their hours and my schedule don't tend to mesh. But one afternoon I just happened to be using 1/2 a vacation day, so I came with a family member. Since it was the middle of the day on a Friday, the place was fairly empty, which I definitely didn't mind - this place is pretty cozy and so it gets cramped quickly during weekend dining rushes.But on to the food, the important part of this review! My dining companion ordered a salad - complete with French fries, 'cause that's how we do salads in Pittsburgh - and I ordered their Feta Burger. Sure, their Raspberry stuffed french toast caught my eye...but Feta burger! How often do you see that on the menu? And I loved that burger, by the way - it was well cooked and the toppings blended perfectly (I snagged a few mushrooms from my companion's salad which made it even better), and definitely felt like good diner food. I left feeling super happy with my meal.Buuuuut...the next day I still couldn't get that french toast of my mind. I just couldn't. So I called in an order for pick-up - good thing I did, too, because there was nowhere to sit when I came in! Saturdays are definitely jam-packed here, understandably so. Well, I got my food, brought it home, and proceeded to devour it. Just, YUM! Seriously - that french toast is a MUST!If I was going to complain about anything it would be that the seating really isn't the most comfortable on the planet, buuuuut...I can't hold it against them. I just can't. Not after that french toast. See you next time, Dor-Stop!I visited the Dor Stop for brunch this past Sat. with CM.  Given that we were headed out to South Park for a hike, and we wanted to get brunch beforehand, I suggested we take the opportunity to try the Dor Stop, since Dormont was on the way and I'd heard great things about their brunch (not to mention that they were on DDD!).  In hopes of beating the late-rising rush, we arrived at around 10:30, and it worked out perfectly, since we only had to wait about 15 min. to be seated.Once we were seated, we were promptly greeted and given menus by one of the waitstaff.  Having checked out the reviews ahead of time, I knew I wanted to try the raspberry French toast.  I mentioned the other items that had been featured on DDD--and that people enjoy, based on the reviews--to CM, and he decided to go with the famous pumpkin pancakes (yeah, that's what I call them, rather than hot cakes--so sue me!).  Our order was taken promptly, and was delivered to our table about 10 min. after ordering.  My French toast looked exactly like I expected, based on the pictures--it consisted of four toast points covered with raspberry sauce, and drizzled with raspberry jam.  The toast was perfectly crispy, and the sauce was delicious and flavorful--it was everything I could want in a sweet brunch item!  However, I did find the name of this dish a bit misleading, since the toast itself wasn't actually stuffed, unlike other versions I've tried before.I tried a bite of CM's pumpkin pancakes, and they were also delectable--unlike most pancakes I've had, they were quite moist even without any syrup, and definitely included real pumpkin, rather than just pumpkin pie spice, like many pumpkin items I've tried.  The butter added some welcome savoriness to the sweetness of the pancakes, and a bit of syrup added some additional moistness.  Since both of our dishes came with a breakfast meat, we ordered bacon (duh!), which provided us with a supply of umami flavor when we wanted a break from the sweetness of our entrees.Overall, CM and I were very pleased with our experience at the Dor Stop.  Our total check, which included a glass of milk for me in addition to our entrees, came to around $20, which we felt was quite reasonable in light of the quality of the dishes.  Service was friendly and efficient, and the ambiance was cheerful and light-filled--exactly what I'd expect in a diner.  Even though we both felt a tad out of place among the clientele, which was almost completely white families with young children (very different than your typical East End eating establishment, which is what we're both accustomed to), we felt welcome.  Without a doubt, the Dor-Stop offers one of the best breakfasts in PGH, and doesn't disappoint for down home diner goodness!

I love Yelp cause I can share my many experiences with you and the world. So today, in desperate need of a margarita, I decided to stop here with a couple of friends for a pitcher and some guacamole. After a few margaritas, I found their "healthy" menu and decided to order their  "vegan" veggie burrito. Problem was there was nothing vegan about it. After several bites of the burrito, I found a large piece of burnt steak inside. NASTY! If that wasn't enough, after consuming nearly half of the black beans it was served with, I found pieces of pork in the beans. That explains why they were so salty. I presented all of this to the manager who was kind enough to take most of everything, minus the booze, off of the bill. Revolting.I wanted to take my sister out for dinner last night to celebrate her upcoming 21st birthday prior to going to see Cirque Du Soliel. We both love Mexican food and Carlos O'Brien's is literally within walking distance from my house. We used to go all the time as kids, but it has been years since I have been there last. I'm glad we gave it a try because we had a really great experience. We were seated immediately even though it was 5:45pm. We had friendly, attentive service from both our busser and our server.We were served delicious, warm tortilla chips shortly after sitting with a tasty, fresh, and chunky salsa. They also provided the liquefied hot sauce, but I did not eat it because I do not like that kind at any restaurant.I decided on the veggie fajitas. The black beans are vegetarian, the refrieds are not. My sister selected the fajita quesedilla, sans meat.Our food arrived quickly and piping hot. Both of us had huge portion sizes and the food was extremely fresh and really tasty. They put a salty and slightly spicy seasoning on their fajitas, which come with a mixture of peppers, onions, squash, zucchini and potatoes. Back in the day when I used to eat meat (15+ years ago) I always ordered the shredded beef chimi. It was amazing. I would assume that it retains the same amazing taste and size as when I favored it as a child, but who knows.Our meal came to $21 and I gladly tipped our server over 20%! I will definitely be back when I have a cheat day on my diet!!Was my 1st time at Carlos O'Brien's, it was a friends 40th birthday dinner and this is her favorite place to go. I went with high expectations because she has told me over and over the past few years how good this place is.I arrived couple minutes after everyone was there and saw that the party (there was about 25 of us) was broken sort of into you, half the party down one side and other wrapped around the middle and the birthday girl was kind of not at either tables, just in the middle of the 2, which made it difficult for conversations to flow, you could talk to your half of the table, but if you want to talk with those on the other side of the restaurant, get up and walk over their then, needless to say, I stayed where I was at and talked amongst my fellow friends on my side, kept giving the bday girl a shout out and drinks to let her know we are here to party! Let's start with the salsa, their where 2 types, a pico de gallo and a hotter blend, which reminded me more of a smoky chipotle sauce.  Well the pico looked great, but had absolutely no flavor, no pepper ,no onion, no tomato flavor, not even the cilantro, which is my favorite ingredient to cook with, had flavor, even if you added salt and pepper to it, it didn't help.  The hotter of the two did have a nice smoky chipotle taste to it, so that was the one I went with it. I went with the filet of Salmon with mango salsa with Spanish rice and black beans.  The fish was perfectly cooked, and even though the top of the fish appeared to have some sort of rub on it, it too was lacking in flavor, I tossed on the mango salsa to see if that would help and sadly it did not, no flavor at all. I topped it with the smoky chipotle to give some sort of flavor and appearance that I'm not eating mush. The rice and beans were perfectly cooked, no issues there.  Had this dish had flavor to it, it would have been amazing, but nope it did not.Now like I said we were spilt into 2 along one sided booth table things from one end of the room to the other, and there was apx 25 if not more of us. But by the time my end of the table had gotten their food, the other half was already paying and leaving.  It was not because I was late; I got their in time for orders to be taken. This was poor planning on the server's behalf, half the party had ready left by the time we got our bills.  I was bummed because I was wanting to catch up with a friend I hadn't seen in a while and poof she was gone .  I wanted to like this place, but I'm afraid I am a onetime diner here.

Review Text :
I've been in Pittsburgh for a long time, and if you read through my reviews, you'll see that I love eating in Pittsburgh. I'm from NYC, so it's not that my palate is easy to satisfy. I just really think that Pittsburgh has great restaurants with authentic, and tasty foods. I am a serious advocate of dining in Pittsburgh, and I take pride in knowing the good places to eat. There, those are my self-proclaimed credentials. So take this to heart: Andy's Sushi Bar (located in Wholey's) is probably the #1 place to get sushi/rolls in Pittsburgh. Now, a few caveats: it is NOT a restaurant, it is a stand inside Wholey's supermarket that does take-out orders ONLY. You will NOT get a dining experience, so for those of you who want to go to a nice japanese restaurant for dinner, you are not in luck. This sushi stand is only open for lunch, and typically closes at about 4pm on a weekday. You could be waiting about 15-30 minutes depending on the time/day you go because there is just one guy who makes the orders. He's fast, but his line can get long. Take it for what it is: Andy uses fresh and tasty fish. He cuts you big pieces for both his a la carte pieces and his rolls. He will make you any custom order you'd like provided he has the ingredients. He does have a limited selection of Sushi/Sashimi platters. He has a good spider roll and after going a few times, definitely ask for the "Chef's Special" -- he just loads up a roll for you. You won't be disappointed.And, as for prices, it's the best bang for your buck for sushi. what more could you ask for.It really pains me to do this, because Andy himself is such a cool and friendly dude, but after eating at Penn Ave Fish Company for so long...I just can't bring myself to get his sushi anymore. It's... just... not that good.  It all snapped into place for me one day recently.  The sushi rolls he makes are massive, but the taste just isn't there.  He's rushing to make them so fast that as soon as you put your chopsticks around them they completely fall apart.  And the most important part, the fish, doesn't seem all that fresh.  Definitely not as fresh as Penn Ave., which is weird considering he "lives" in a fresh fish mecca.  But the thing I think I've really grown to hate that weird brown sauce he puts on everything.  Yuck!  I just can't stand it!  I know I can ask to have it off, but as soon as I seem to remember, it's on there in a flash.I know it may be cheap and it may be fast, but to me it's just not worth it.  Penn Ave IS right down the street...and I PROMISE you'll love their fresh and delicious sushi!

On my continued hunt to find the best Chinese in Charlotte, I decided to check out Baoding this past Sunday night, after not visiting for more than 10 years.Upon arriving we were greeted by an extremely friendly staff and saw that almost every table was full, that is a good sign!We started with spring rolls and wonton soup. The spring rolls were light, fresh and deep fried to perfection, and served with a great dipping sauce. As for the wonton soup, one of the best of have had. The broth had an amazing flavor and came with three chicken stuffed wontons, spinach and thinly sliced eggs.As for the entrees, we ordered the Beijing Duck, duck served with plum sauce, cucumbers, scallions and thin light pancakes, and Chicken and Shrimp with mixed vegetables in a brown sauce.the Chicken and Shrimp was a large portion, allowing me to have left-overs Monday night, and was delicious. They do not skimp on the protein. As for the veggies, too many I cannot even recall, but they were cooked to perfection.As for the duck, I am not a huge duck fan, but I did make one pancake and enjoyed it very much. The plum sauce gives the duck a nice flavor and the meal is definitely something I recommend checking out, especially if you like duck.Throughout the meal, the service did not disappoint.  Baoding is definitely a go to Chinese spot in my mind!

I really thought I'd never be back.  The goulash I had was so so gross.  But then,  was roped in by some friends who were doing a Sunday brunch book club.  Of course I couldn't miss out on tantalizing conversation... so I obliged.  I really had no clue what they offered for brunch options, but quickly learned they have a a pretty decent size brunch buffet.  I'm not below buffets at all, it's the fat kid in me!  Most things still looked a little questionable to me, but I went for the big ticket items.  Make your own omelets, potato pancakes and dessert.  I'd hit up the buffet again, but still be hasty to check out the regular menu again.  The omelet was made right in front of you, so I added cheese, mushrooms, peppers, tomatoes and onions.  I was super excited about it because it was the size of a football.  Sadly, it was pretty tasteless.  I don't think they added any salt or pepper to the egg mix, so it came out really bland, despite loading up on ingredients.  But the potato pancakes... I could survive on them forever.  They were amazeballs!  Add some sour cream and I was in potato patch heaven!  I had to keep myself from getting more because of the other thing I loaded up on... dessert.  The desserts looked unassuming, but they were also awesome.  I had a smattering of delectable bites.  The scones were so moist and tasty.  I had to stop myself from taking more than 20.  I also had some carrot cake, brownies, cookies among other things I inhaled and didn't pay attention too.  Should I be embarrassed?  Probably.  But I don't care because it was darn good!Our first stop in Pittsburgh, what a great start! Had a couple of yuenglings, a warm, salty yummy soft pretzel and a big ole plate of German goodness in da tummy!The Peasant Platter had knock wurst, weisswurst and a pork chop on top of heap of sauerkraut...with potato pancakes, spaetzel and a basket of baked breads!  So.much.food.  And oh soooo good!The bar is cool, staff is really nice and I believe they offer their patrons a free ride to and from on game days!

Hzappy Paczki Dzay Evzerzybodyzy!!!!So, if you're from one of the cities back east with a large Polish population (like Chicago), Paczkis are pretty much a staple for Fat Tuesday.  For those of you unfamiliar, it's pretty much a filled donut, but they're really good, and made even more special because you can only ever get them 1 day a year.  I was told on good authority that Europa is *the* place to go in the valley for real Polish fare, and it certainly didn't disappoint.  They had a whole case of authentic looking Polish baked things like Paczkis and Kolachkis and other things I can't spell or pronounce, but also have lots of Ks, Zs and Is in their names.  From what I saw, the paczkis they had were:  raspberry, prune, cherry & cream cheese, apple, custard, strawberry & probably a few more I'm forgetting. They also had a little Polish deli with more food I won't even attempt to spell, but it certainly seemed authentic.  Lots of sausages and meats and things.   Also, even the people that worked there were authentically Polish!  Well, I'm assuming so, at least.  They were white and spoke with accents I couldn't understand, but reminded me of the northwest side of Chicago.  Go forth and enjoy the fatty deliciousness that is the Paczki before you have to do the whole "Lent" thing, if that's the sort of thing you're into.  If not, enjoy it without having to do any of that pesky fasting.I put my body through hell and back.. some months Ill low carb others Ill eat WAY to much of everything.. the American yoyo diet I suppose. On the eve of my low carb madness I come to Europa to pick up a few goodies.The cheese and cherry coffee cake is the BEST Ive ever tasted! Moist flaky crust covered in cheese and canned cherries.. sheer delight and a real middle finger to the low carb diet! I feel so good and bad all at the same time.Only 4 because I do not have anything to compare to really? I had the stuffed cabbage, stuffed with ground turkey and spices, and the potato and cheese perogi's. They call it a small plate. LOL that stuff is filling. I think next time I will get two stuffed cabbages because they are the shit. The perogi's were great too. I am glad it was the small plate because it left just enough room for "Apple Slice" apparently it is a Polish version of apple pie. The top crust is more cake like with a glaze over the top. It totally hit the spot. The service is what you would expect from a family fun place .... Perfect and helpful.

Review Text :
Let's face Phoenix. If you say you'll never dine at a restaurant that exists in a strip mall, you're gonna be missing about 43% of Phoenix restaurants. Cherry Blossom, located in a deliciously skanky strip mall on Camelback is a true gem. Not a hidden gem, however, as I notice it's been yelped frequently and seems to be well received. I'll have to say I wasn't thrilled with my noodle dish, kinda bland. However, the sushi rolls were fantastic. The tempura shrimp in particular was mouth watering. My friends thai inspired soup was so good I almost wanted to dive in so I could simply lap it up with my tongue. But he hit me on my forehead with his spoon so I retreated back to my sushi rolls. Service was first rate. I had a manger meeting and we were there almost 2 1/2 hours and were never hurried and not once did we get the "waiter stink eye". If you've ever been privey to that, ouch, it stings! There were 7 of us and the bill came to about $100 so all I can is "come on down" cuz the "price is right" at CherryBlossom Noodle Cafe....Just got some to go action from the CherryBlossom peeps and I'm dripping in soy sauce as I type. YUM! Quick, attentive and friendly service! I can't wait to dive into my wasabi, my spicy tuna roll and my crunch roll. If you read this and I still have some left...ha ha...I might share with you. But, props to the staff for the sake while I was waiting...Strip malls in Phoenix shall not be ignored people!3.5 stars... Cherryblossom Noodle Cafe is a really good concept.  (It's a shame that Phoenix is lacking on options when it comes to Noodle Houses; Chicago, New York, and DC have noodles galore but we're not there yet I guess.)  Anyways, Cherryblossom has a welcoming ambiance and decent service too. I've been a few times, so I figured it would be the perfect place to stop for a late dinner last night after Urban Affair.  (It was Friday night around 9:30, so no problem getting in and seated right away).We sat at the bar and got drinks immediately.  Since the BF had already eaten a bunch of appetizers at the event we were at, he said he'd just share whatever I ordered.  So, I chose the miso eggplant appetizer and the Yaki Udon Noodle entree with tofu.  The eggplant dish was really tasty but they served it straight from the stove and we both burned our mouths taking the first bite.  We had to let it sit another few minutes to cool down enough to eat it.  (Note - I'm not complaining; I'd rather have my food served too hot than not hot enough... )  We finished the eggplant dish up right as the noodle dish arrived.  The noodles themselves were cooked just right but the dish had a weird flavor to it.  It just didn't taste right, or maybe it was just nothing special.  Either way, I would skip the Yaki Udon and go for something else on the menu when you go.Although I wouldn't rave about the food on my most recent visit to Cherryblossom, it was quick and cheap for a latenight dinner.  We were in and out in less than an hour and it was $20 out the door with tip - can't complain about that!  I'll be back!This was our first time at CherryBlossom. Hubby has needed to eat more vegetarian lately, so I've been on the lookout for new places with more options. The food was mostly great. Hubby enjoyed his tofu yakisoba, I liked my chicken katsu (although a couple of pieces were not quite done), loved my salad, liked the bread basket, and we both really enjoyed the crispy California roll. Dessert was also pretty good- we liked my flan better than his green tea mousse (which was not very sweet except for the almond flavored cream on top). Service was attentive in the beginning and then our waiter disappeared. I witnessed two other tables in our section grow confused and then annoyed as we waited... and waited... and waited for the waiter to return. One couple was even in mid-payment and finally went to the take out counter to inquire what was happening. I asked the busser to let the waited know we wanted our check. This disappearing act really took the shine off of an otherwise nice dinner. We'll likely return, however, to give CherryBlossom another chance.The only thing that prevents me from giving this place five stars is the inconsistency and slowness of the service. The place has a casual, relaxed atmosphere and the staff is friendly, but it often seems to take forever for the food to arrive, even when the restaurant isn't busy or crowded. I have nothing to complain about regarding the food itself - for me it has consistently been good, the servings ample, and the prices reasonable. And I do like the idea that they serve both Asian and Italian dishes, so that Cherry Blossom is a logical destination for me and my friends when we want to dine out but can't seem to decide on one cuisine to have for the evening. If only the service were a bit faster ...My friends and I ate here yesterday and I thought the food was good. They were pretty busy during the lunch hour, so we didn't get served right away. We also had to get our own menus because they were too busy. The restaurant itself has a nice array of Japanese noodles and sushi. Next time I will try their delightful tofu appetizers and healthy dinners. It was kinda weird seeing a basket full of bread and Melba toasts served with our noodle bowls though. I normally don't eat bread with Oriental noodles, but then my friend Michael mentioned that they also serve Italian pastas. I guess that make sense since it is a Noodle cafe. The decor inside is very Japanese. This eatery really complements the food with a light and comfy feel with their tables comfortably spaced apart. The price is definitely reasonable and really worth it.My friend John and I ate here this afternoon and we both had a pleasant experience. Our server Yuka recognized my friend John and gave him a hug. I guess John used to eat at Kirin Wok in downtown phoenix where she used to work. She said the place closed down, but the owners still works as food vendors at events and festivals as well as private catering. She was very attentive and gave us exceptional service. We started off with Tofu steaks with shitake mushrooms and vegetable tempura appetizers. Both were pretty good and then John got the Kitsune Udon Japanese Noodle for lunch and I ordered the Cappellini with tomato and garlic. Both were savory and delicious. I really like this place and I wish the other reviewers would try them more than once. They have amazing dishes, a relaxed atmosphere and offer great service with a smile.This is one of the places where I can say Japanese food has a little uniqueness to it. I like the whole Japanese Italian Cafe and Bakery look to it. It reminds me of the spin that the restaurants in Japan does too.I had the Tekka Don. Which was a sashimi rice bowl. It was good. Practically, it was a tuna roll not rolled up and put into a bowl. I used to get the Ika Mentai but that's becoming boring a bit.The atmosphere is nice but you can definitely expect a wait. For the love of everything delicious, don't go to one of those American chains pretending to be a Japanese restaurant. :cough cough: Ra Sushi.I find myself at CherryBlossom a lot nowadays, and that's why I needed to update my review. I've discovered my new favorite menu items, and they must be eaten! So, you should try:Spicy Gyoza PotCha-shu RamenTanTan-Men RamenUdon SukiThe gyoza pot is my favorite menu item (and it's on happy hour).  It's simple and delicious. I am completely satisfied with a Kirin and the gyoza pot for dinner. The Cha-shu is a damn good bowl of ramen, and the TanTan is even better if you're up for something spicy. My newest discovery, and the reason I needed to write this, is the Udon Suki. It consists of udon noodles, tofu, green onions, sliced beef, and a poached egg floating in a savory broth. CherryBlossom's Udon Suki is awesome, filling, and awesome.I have come to the realization that the service is hit or miss at this place, but in my opinion, the food makes up for any shortcomings. Go try some of the dishes I just mentioned and let me know what you think!I am not a big fan of Asian foods so finding a place that I can find something to eat on the menu while Dave enjoys all the sushi, udon, seafood he can eat in a meal is quite the daunting task.  Cherry Blossom is just the place we have been searching for.  I enjoyed some spicy ramen with chicken while Dave got to have sushi and seafood udon. Perusing the menu I found more than just the ramen that I am interested in trying.  This is definitely a place we can visit again and again.At last I've finally tried the beloved Cherry Blossom Cafe, and now I wonder what took me so long and when can I return! I asked for suggestions from my friends who are frequent customers, and everything came with rave reviews. In the mood for late night spice I chose the Tan-tan Men, a spicy noodle soup made with minced pork, delicious! Of course when offered more chili I dropped a spoonful or two in but only to add to the heat, the flavor was pure perfection! The prices were reasonable, the service was prompt and friendly and the menu offers so many choices, ramen, sushi, udon, miso, salads, and wait for it....Italian yes you read correctly bit unique but is that ever a bad thing..? Variety is the spice of life, when done well and Cherry Blossom has done just that and more!With this cool weather, I had a hankering for a bowl of hot ramen so to Cherryblossom I went.I decided to take advantage of the Happy Hour and got the Salmon Nigiri which came with 3 pieces and ordered the Hakata Ramen with an extra egg. The Salmon Nigiri was actually really good, soft and fresh tasting. The rice was a bit on the wet side so didn't keep it's form well under the Salmon. However, the flavor was there and tasted best with a touch of wasabi and a light dipping in soy sauce.The Hakata Ramen was pretty basic, I can tell they use powdered broth for their ramen as my tongue got a little bit funny feeling from the MSG. It comes with stick straight ramen, green onion, char-shu, wood-ear mushroom (ki- kurage) and my side order of egg- poached. The broth is Hakata style, made with pork bones and appears creamy, fatty and white in color. Though it is Hakata style, the flavors aren't complex as other ramen I've had and as I've stated was apparent they use a soup base mix/powder. The noodles were okay- though not always a fan of stick straight noodles, but the portion was just right. The char-shu was on the thicker side, but seasoned well. The egg, I wish was soft boiled instead of poached and lacked seasoning/flavor. Another thing that bugged me was that the ramen wasn't hot, it was warm ... perhaps sitting out in the pass a little too long?Over all I would come here for more Nigiri and pass on the ramen, the ramen is doable for the price point but nothing to get overly excited about. Thus far, their pasta and sushi seems the most promising here.The service is also pretty good as everything is friendly and quick!I love coming here during off peak hours, not to busy and our food came out pretty fast. The service was really good, we got Fumihiko as our server. He is the most nicest & polite server that I've had. One of my favorite food to eat here is the Katsu-don pork bowl. It's very delicious, they put egg on top, sliced scallions and when you scoop the rice from the bottom of the bowl, it's soak with some kind of a broth, it's really good!! We also ordered the Cha-shu ramen, the broth was good too and the BBQ pork was tender. They also serve bread and butter while waiting for your food.I like coming to CherryBlossom for the tan tan man Ramon.  It is a great price and I love the favor of it too.  Every time I come the service is great and they are alway really busy.  The restaurant is not all that big,  so when you get there you will probably have to wait 10 to 15 minutes.  I guess in a way this is one of my favorite places to come for Ramon.  It is in a small shopping center off of camelback and 9th street.Based on the great Yelp reviews, my boyfriend and I decided to try Cherryblossom Noodle Cafe, and we felt happy with our decision.Because other reviewers raved about the shrimp dumplings, the Korean spicy beef, and the cha she ramen, we decided to share them. Everything was yummy. My boyfriend REALLY liked the spicy beef, while I preferred the shrimp dumplings.The service and atmosphere were really nice, too.We will return to try other menu offerings soon!

You drive up and toss the keys to the valet while experiencing the heady mouth-watering aroma of cooking meat.Then as you walk up the trail to the front door your nose is assaulted with the other kind of meat: alive and pooping in a pen. Dang, that  bull had the biggest antlers I've ever seen - oh, like I know what  you call those pointy things. Upon entering you're offered a choice: stairs or slide. The 11 kids in our party uniformly opted for the slide. Over and over and over again. So did most of the moms. The 2 dads and one boyfriend all stuck with the stairs.The family style pork ribs were great. And can I have two of those delish Margies, rocks with salt, plskthx? Nummers.The establishment itself was gracious to the point of absurdity. We had a 5.30pm reservation for a party of 22. Due to bad traffic, getting lost, missing turns, and just general bad planning, half of us were 45 minutes late. On Valentine's Day, no less! And we were the early ones! The other half of us arrived another hour later. Half of those in our party were girls between the ages of 6 and 14 and no one batted an eye. (And yes, now you all know how pitiful my life is that I spent Valentine's Day with a giant group of kids.)The band was excellent. The dancing was fun to watch but I'd never participate due to my 17 left feet. The only thing I'd change were the gray mealy beans.Great place to greet then eat your meat.I can honestly say that I don't remember too much about the food, but the experience. Now that's a whole 'nother story. Picture this... I'm in Phoenix on a business trip at the Best Western HQ. So the owner of my company says that she heard about this restaurant that has a slide and she wants to try it out. Hmmm. A restaurant with a slide? Boss is paying. Hey, I'm coming, let me get my purse (for decoration only tonight). Well, after we driver to the end of the universe, we finally arrive. There are three in our party, including my crazy BGF co-worker. For those of you in the hotel biz, he's a night auditor, 'nuff said, you get the picture. Once we are seated (and the view is spectacular), we peruse the menu (oh, I ix nayed the slide. After seeing a heavy set lady with a dress on slide down and leave her booty juice.... again, nuff said). We looked over the menu and boss lady decides that we should try the fried rattlesnake and the Cowboy Platter. I'm game, remember, she's paying. Fried rattlesnake. What the he!! was I thinking? Must have been that quart sized drink I inhaled (remember, she's paying). Ok, what does it taste like? Popcorn chicken from KFC, over cooked. Again, nuff said. We're discussing the merits of Fried rattlesnake (that darn drink again) when we hear a commotion. Running across the restaurant like the kitchen is on fire, come 3 waiters. One has a triangle and is screaming at the top of their lungs. And the other two have this massive metal platter between them, held above their heads. They are all screaming and heading for us. I'm looking like an intoxicated (drink, boss, paying) deer in headlights as my auditory system catches up and sends the signal to my brain. "COWBOY SPECIAL, COWBOY SPECIAL, COWBOY SPECIAL" Oh great, now everyone in the restaurant is looking at our eclectic little group. My little Asian boss, dressed in flowers from head to toe with her $350 pumps, my BGF who is about 6"5, 400# and bald as an egg, and me, the fully intoxicated (Drink, Boss, Free) Korean American in her business suit. This platter had like 1/2 a cow, a chicken family and the 3 little pigs on it. I couldn't even begin to do it justice. It should have come with a warning. DO not eat for a week before ordering this special. Needless to say, I had an elephant bag to take with me after dinner (too much for a mere doggie). Oh and the piece de resistance? Why my boss convinced me (Booze. Free. Boss) that the free country line dancing on the patio for everyone to see would be just the thing. WRONG! No rhythm when I'm sober, so you know how this looked. Two left feet when I'm not drinking. You get the picture? One last time.....Drink. Free. Boss. "Nuff Said!I'm welcomed by Horny, the most pampered bull in the Valley with his diva-like attitude. I walk in the doors and I'm immediately offered two options to get to my table: the quick route -- the ever-so-popular slide -- or the boring way -- the stairs. The six year-old child in me screams "take the slide you coward!!" OK, what the hay right? After I've recovered, I walk through sawdust lined wooden floors on my way to my seat. During my journey, I pass by a live band playing on the stage, the energetic waitstaff teaching visitors how to two-step, a magician mystifying the crowd, a photo prop inviting me to be a plump cowgirl and stuffed rattlesnakes peering at me from their containers. You have just re-visited many, many of my nights throughout my life at Rustler's Rooste. Rustler's Rooste is a classic and a must-visit if you're in town vacationing, you want to throw a party or you simply want to make it a cowboy adventure of a night out on the town. I've been coming here since I could barely walk. As a child, I rarely left the slide area and would join the group of other children waiting in line to go up and down the slide the entire night while the grown-ups ate. Place a slide in a restaurant and it's endless hours of childhood fun. The food is good and hearty. From flavorful BBQ chicken to tender ribs to juicy steak, I never leave hungry. Oh did someone say rattlesnake? Well yes, yes they do happen to serve that southwestern delicacy, but only if you're really in the mood for an adventure. I normally stick with the basics. I've been to several events at Rustler's Rooste, including one of my favorites in the main ballroom equipped with long picnic tables and a stage for live music. Plus, the entire restaurant is situated on the rim of South Mountain and has spectacular views of the valley. Go during sunset. It's a romantic must. As if the night couldn't possibly get more fun, they now serve cotton candy to all the guests at the end of the meal. The child in me screams with happiness every time I enter Rustler's Rooste and the adult in me loves that this is one of the only remaining restaurants where you can walk in and receive the true southwest experience. And even though I live in AZ, I absolutely love it when I visit and receive the reminder from Rustler's Rooste just how authentic and special AZ is, especially with gems like Rustler's Rooste!Now the last time I was at The Rooste, I was bedazzled in pink Hello Kitty cowboy hat taking home first prize. I think it was some kind of yelp sticker lol! And that's when I got the full flavor of this meaty, enormous yet charming country restaurant/bar/event facility/iconic Phoenix restaurant. We yelpers devoured the buffet and downed some free beer. This time, a little different...Let the sawdust fly!Picture this. South Mountain. Covered in careening white mini vans and large American cars. Children. Everywhere. Like Children of the Corn. Octogenarians with walkers complete with two yellow tennis balls. Parents scrambling to keep their brood in order. Teenagers glued to their smart phones, completely unaware of the reason for this holiday. The stealing of land from the Native Americans. Yep. We Americans sure know when to party.Picture this. Me. My mom and my dad. Two of the cutest things I've ever seen. Walking. Slowly. Navigating the "rustic" entrance to the restaurant. It's like they're trying to imitate Tim Conway. Me? Patient. Oh so patient. You see, I was psyched to have my folks all to myself. No cooking. No cleaning. But would the food be gross? Cafeteria-like? And the worst, cold?No. No. And no.From our warm biscuits and Indian flat bread to our entrees (we all chose turkey with all the fixins)...it was a fantastic meal for $20 a  head. Our server was efficient and delightful. If I remembered her name I would publicly apologize for my father's flirting. Heck. Maybe she liked it! She mentioned she was working from 9am to 9pm. God Bless her. Hope she's wearing sensible shoes. They were helpful with extras (can you say "More gravy please?") and with boxing up to go treats. We skipped dessert as I was serving pumpkin pie, chocolate coffee cake and coffee at my place.The window booth we had (thanks dad for calling ahead) had those famous sweeping views of the valley, brown smog included. And of the large families swallowing the picnic tables outside below, chowing down and obviously having a good time. Other staff were energetic, friendly and helpful. I cannot imagine the pilgrims having a finer meal and a better time then me and my folks. Well, they did have those cute outfits. Not my folks. The pilgrims. Though mom was working her dangely Christmas tree earrings.Oh. The. Holidays.I was very excited because I had won a gift basket at La Noche de Yelp Elite Event in March for Rustler's Rooste and thought well my mom is coming from Washington for a visit in April why not take her there, it would be a 1st time for the both of us! Sounds like a great plan right!Mom came into town, I told her my plan of taking her out to eat, so Sunday came and we are ready to go!  Oh let me give you guys a little insight too, my mom had a stroke when she was in her 30's so walking is hard for her. We got to Rustler's Rooste around 4:25, I never bothered to looked at what times the place was opened, but found out they didn't open till 5, I dropped mom off at valet parking, and they were sweet and showed mom in through the exit so she didn't have to walk the steps. So when I parked the car, the valet told me where my mom went, for a slow walker, she sure did disappear fast , now it's about 4:35, one of the servers saw my mom and told her that when the place opens at 5 someone will seat us by the window if that would be ok with her, it was close to the exit and she was ok with that.Well 5pm came and nothing was happening, so I went up to the stairs and found the hostess and explained that my mom was handicapped and unable to walk up the stairs and where we were told we could wait to be seated, she said did you have reservations? I said no, again didn't think ahead, maybe I should I have, she said well, I have people upstairs that have been waiting for tables and left.   Walked back to mom and told her I didn't get very far.    From my impression from the hostess, only way I was going to get a table was if I walked upstairs to get it for us, and this left me with a bad impression, that maybe the RR isn't handicap friendly. Like only those who can get up the stairs can have tables, hurray for the walking!   My mom, who is more even tempered then me and is ok with just waiting, said just be still, so I waited. Another lady showed up about 6 mins later and asked if we had be helped and I said no we haven't, and she must have been someone important cuz she made it happened.   We were showed to our table, our waitress was Jennifer, very nice and very sweet, she explained the menu to us, since it was both our 1st time there we ordered the Cowboy Stuff, which was bbq ribs & chicken, crispy shrimp, steak & seafood kabobs, beans, veggies, potatoes wedges and some other stuff, I have to say the one thing that stood out was the ribs, omg they are fall off the bone melt in your mouth good! RR knows how to make some ribs! Going to have to come back from some more of them!I have to say Jennifer and the nice man at valet parking showed get customer service, but the hostess left me with a bad impression and she is where the dining experience starts.Let me start by saying, I wish there was an option for  a 1/4 star rating.Went here with another family during our "stay-cation" at a nearby resort. It was HORRIBLE! First, you can't miss the smell as you walk up to the place. I realized this is because of the Texas Longhorn right in front. Nothing like the smell of excrement and urine right before dinner. Second, the NOISE! This is a country western themed steakhouse, so whatever, be warned. Third, the service was the worst. Since we had a party of 8, an 18% gratuity is automatically added to our bill. That's fine, I get it, but apparently our waitress felt she didn't have to work for it since it's mandatory. She was rude and not very helpful...at all. I never experienced ordering a $20 appetizer (the fried rattlesnake) and having it thrown on our table, she didn't even stop! I was also looking forward to finishing our biscuits and fry bread, but apparently there's a time limit. She took them away without even asking. Fourth, the food was mediocre, at best. I ordered the 16oz T-Bone and it was under seasoned and not very good. The green bean and corn on the cob sides were soggy. At least try to hide the fact that it was over cooked and soaking in hot water before it was served. Fifth, when it came time to pay the bill, we were given the right check, but our credit card was charged for another party's dinner! Really???? We over-paid for a terrible experience! Finally, the General Manager wasn't very interested in our experience as paying customers, he said "it happens". SPEECHLESS! At least he was consistent with the rest of the night.We had better service, treatment, and food from McDonald's the next day.One of my fondest memories of growing up is eating at restaurants on my birthday. It was an occasion that conjured up the entire waitstaff, as they clapped their hands (and probably rolled their eyes), sang happy birthday, and delivered me a massive dessert adorned by a tiny glowing birthday candle. My twins just turned 5 and I wanted them to also have that delightful moment of abundant attention and sugar.  So, I started to look for places that would sing happy birthday.  Apparently, this is yet another thing to file in the "good old days" category.  Supposedly My Big Fat Greek Restaurant sings happy birthday in Greek...which sounds interesting, unless you are a 5 year old.Rustler's Rooste was suggested and it is true - they do sing happy birthday!  However, for a $15 price  tag.  But!  You also get a cowboy hat.I have to give them props for keeping the birthday spirit alive and well, even if it is no longer free.  The candle-lit dessert that arrives is enough to feed 3-4 people.  It is a football-sized eclair, oozing with whipped cream (my favorite food), and drizzled with chocolate (my second favorite food).As for the rest of the food....it is okay.  The meal starts with complimentary bread and butter and salad (ice berg lettuce, cucumber, a few cherry tomatoes and croutons).  I do appreciate getting food immediately, even if it is mostly iceberg lettuce and chewy bread.For the meal, I had the "catch of the day" which was ahi tuna.  It was well seasoned, but it could have been more pink.  I will say the exact same thing about my husband's steak.  The kids-meal portion of macaroni & cheese was terrifyingly huge; I think it was the largest portion size among the entire table.  I was relieved I opted to get steamed broccoli instead of french fries that came on the side.  But this may just not be the place you go for a fine-dining experience.  It is a place you go for a fun-dining experience.  There is a slide that all the kids love...and maybe some adults (*cough*) enjoy it as well.  There is also a big cow  that greets you at the entrance.  Does it emit a smell that I want to smell right before eating? Probably not.  But I will give it a few points for having such large, curly horns.A friend wanted to come here for his birthday. I tried to talk him out of it - but it *was* his birthday, and sometimes, it can be fun to be a hokey tourist in your own town.We had no delusions about what we were in for. This is not a great restaurant. This is a cheesy, cowboy themed resort restaurant that caters to tourists and happens to have a great view. To make sure we did it right, we changed clothes prior to going - to ensure we could enjoy the slide down into the dining room. (Without offending parents of innocent children or risking chafing to dangly bits.)We started with a cocktail in the bar while waiting for a table. Did we each order the sickly-sweet tropical nonsense in a glass cowboy boot and served while on fire? You bet your ass we did! (Now, to figure out what to do with my glass cowboy boot souvenir...)There's sawdust on the floor, and the décor screams "Disney Design Company." All the clichés of an old West steakhouse/saloon are represented - down to the raised stage where the live band performs all the safe, upbeat Country standards.When we were seated, a basket of fry bread was delivered with both regular and honey butter. Do you know what's wrong with fried bread and butter? Not a damn thing!This is not a menu for the health conscious. And based on the prices, there's no possible way it's great quality meat. ($24.95 for a bone in rib-eye - with salad, carrots and corn??) The portions are ginormous, there's a decent variety of options, and rotating monthly specials.I had discreetly mentioned it was my friend's birthday (because I put the "B" in subtle!) I wasn't down with spending the extra money for the birthday package...and really, who needs an éclair sundae that must weigh in at five pounds - so we were both pleased when the waiter brought my friend cotton candy with a candle.We went in with expectations of touristy cheesiness and set the bar very, very low for dinner service. And we were both pleasantly surprised. The food was completely satisfactory. The service was completely decent. And when it came down to it - we had an absolute blast.Rustler's Rooste is not a great restaurant by any stretch, and it's not trying to be - but it can be great fun if you let it...and that makes it a great place!

Mutt-friendly microbrews - oh yea.Hiking with Jaek recently one evening was culminated wonderfully with a tasty ale on their shaded patio.Sure it was warm, but we were together - a boy and his dog and his beer.Beautiful, man, beautiful.I hate to be an asshole, but I hated this place. I came here yesterday with a group of friends for lunch. Our 15 minute wait turned into what felt like an hour, when impatient me finally went in to see what the deal was... To my surprise, there was an empty table for a party of 7 that was just sitting there. Are you kidding me? So I ask one of the servers if its cool that we snag it, to which he said Yes. Just cram in tight. NO big deal. So I go and grab my friends to alert them that the table was ready, and when I walk back in, some stupid little bitchy server is standing there glaring at me telling me she "needs a minute to move the table" while huffing and puffing and sighing and just generally being a little queen about having to move a freakin table. I'm sorry, isn't it your JOB to accommodate patrons? I thanked her as she stormed off, and say something shitty to her about being such an inconvenience. I never saw her again throughout the duration of my visit. Star removal #1.We all sit down, and continue waiting for our drink order to be placed. Finally, after about 10 minutes, this happens, but were without menus, so no one *really* knows what they want, Waitress huffs, rolls her eyes, and goes to grab menus. We look, she takes our order, but only for about 6 of the 8 people at the table. She somehow forgot about the tallest man at the table and the girl sitting across from him. Once she comes back, after 3 attempts, she gets the order wrong, serves me my sake without a cup or a glass for my beer. Seriously?Star removal #2.We finally order. Mind you, this was the longest lunch in the universe, because at this point we had already been there for an hour. Luckily our waitress got the order correct, except a few of us ended up waiting at least 45 minutes for our rolls to come out.. specifically the Avocado rolls.. did you run to California to grow and pick them yourself because.. wow. Star removal #3.They managed to Eff up the most important part, which was the SUSHI. My unagi was not fresh, the spicy tuna tasted like plastic, they only had smoked salmon, no raw. They waitress *highly* recommended the dessert roll, which was ice cream rolled in rice krispys.. I know that sounds awesome and all, but im here for sushi, not ice cream. Also, on the menus, it says they have the choice to put a grat on ANY size party.. this to me is absolutely absurd.Star Removal #4I'm sorry, but when you see a PARTY OF EIGHT slide in, you do everything in your power to make these people happy, because if you don't, you can expect that "We can grat anyone we want" to be the only grat you get. Nothing additonal.Get your shit together Moto, and maybe remind your waitstaff that their JOB is to make sure your patrons enjoy themselves, not make us feel like a burden. If it weren't for them, this review wouldn't have been so shitty.P.S. Start to finish, lunch took 2.5 hours. FAIL.The people who regularly patronize Moto must not have jobs, or lives, or children, or pets, because if they did, they would constantly be late to everything they did, have a pissed off babysitter, and dead animals littering their house.I am extremely understanding and very forgiving, but when it takes over 45 minutes to bring me avocado rolls, when it really isn't busy, there is something way wrong. Like wayyyy wrong.I had the miso soup. Didn't like it. Once I finally got the avocado rolls, they were really good, but I was so annoyed that I could barely enjoy them. I also had to ask several times to get my tea refilled.The location is good, my sushi was good and reasonably priced, and the decor is pretty cool, so I am going to give them three stars, but the service was so terribly slow I feel like being served by a sloth would have been more efficient.I really enjoy Moto's Happy Hour. What makes it great is you can get non-sushi items at Happy Hour in addition to sushi. This is a good compromise when you are going with someone who isn't wild about sushi. They do only offer 4 rolls during the Happy (Kalifornia, Tootsie, Philadelphia and Spicy Tuna) but all four are fresh and delicious. We also tried the asian nachos which we both thought were amazing! They are made with friend wontons some kind of spicy cheese, chicken and avocado. (I'm sure there was more on it but we ate it so fast there wasn't time for much research.) You can't beat the Happy hour prices!  For 2 people we had a total of 3 beers, 3 orders of sushi and a small asian nacho and it came to $24. One big improvement over last time was the service was much faster. This place is good for dinner and the AYCE Sushi on Saturdays, but for a first timer I would really recommend the Happy Hour over anything else.All you can eat limited sushi on Saturday for around $20. Sold. I crashed Dottsy Z's  party with two other lovely ladies (Hi Amber and Debi) this past Saturday after literally stepping off of a plane and seeing her post that she was here. The funny thing was that I wasn't really hungry, until I saw all the yummy food in front of me. Eel rolls, Las Vegas rolls, Toosie Maki Rolls, Spicy Tuna Rolls, good lawd I was in heaven. I ate so much that I arrived looking "skinny" and I left looking as if I was expecting a baby sometime in the very near future lol. Sad case yes. Our waitress was extremely nice but a little overworked since it appeared as if she was working the entire restaurant solo. So if you are hankering for some sushi, go on a Saturday over to Moto Sushi. But be warned, you must eat everything that you order if you order off the all you can eat, or you will be charged 50 cents per piece that you leave on your plate. So don't overdo it. (We left nada! lol)I have held off writing a review for Moto for a year or so.  Sadly I have been subject to dining here multiple times, because I am sucker for 'second chances...and third and fourth'...Moto joined the North Central scene years ago, and sadly has gone down hill.  The only thing helping it stay afloat is the lack of other sushi restaurants in the area for the citizens of the neighborhood to enjoy.  The service is pitiful, and it seems like they hire anyone that inquires.  Dining at Moto takes over an hour and a half, with just 3 people.  Getting water upon arrival is painful and receiving the exact food you ordered, is not an option.   Whatever you do...don't come to dine if you have any food allergy. The bartenders are always eating and licking their fingers, touching their hair and then touching everything "sanitary" behind the bar.  The drinks made and ready to go to their respectful customers, just sit at the bar back and begin to water down for easily 10 mins before the floor server magically reappears from the kitchen.The food isnt even good!  Sushi is sloppy, not creative, and poor cuts of fish.  The ALL YOU CAN EAT SUSHI...well, they bank on their horrible service to never bring you the goods as you request and are ready.  We sat in front of empty plates for 35 mins at one point.Twice now, when we were ready to leave, the server is no where to be found (just the same as most of the meal).  I was literally trying to give them money and they would avoid all eye contact and assistance. *que bad SNL skit from the 80s.... Please, do yourself a favor, and do not dine here....and WHATEVER you do...dont take anyone here for dinner, you will embarrass yourself.

FACT: Thee best Italian meal I've had in the Burgh, hands down!FACT: I ate so much I thought they would have to wheel me out on a stretcher.FACT: It's a serious hidden gem in a slightly sketchy neighborhood.Need some more info, because I'm comin' atcha with the goods! To start they set the table with "Holy Oil," which is banana pepper olive oil for dipping Italian bread in, a seasoned cecci bean and cheese gustoso and a goat cheese and olive spread. I wish they sold that banana pepper olive oil because I wanted to have it every day of my life! We ordered the famous Meatball appetizer. This meatball is for serious! It's massive and stuffed with mozzarella cheese. Yep, I'm for realz. It was just oozing Italian sexiness, in a ball. As soon as I tasted the red sauce, it tasted like my Grandma's, which sparked fond memories and made me want to actually live in this place. We also ordered the Trifolata, which is assorted mushrooms and currants in marsala cream. It was also incredible. The bad/good of it was that it wasn't really needed because they give you so much food, but it was delicious, so whatever!For the Third course they serve you your choice of pasta either with their famous home made vodka sauce or fettucini. But here's the thing, the fettucini is made in front of you... in a cheese wheel. Yep, I'm for realz again! I know I'm crazy for not ordering it, but I really love me some vodka sauce and was incredibly happy with this amazing homemade sauce. My hubby got the fetticini and loved it. See, we're all happy here!Fourth course is a salad with red vinagariette, roasted red peppers, candied walnuts, golden raisens and gargonzola cheese. It wasn't memorable amongst all the bangin' dishes but not too shabby at all.For the Fifth course (and when I finally tapped out) I ordered the Cioppino with shrimp, mussels, clams, scallops and fish in a saffron and tomato broth with sambuca. It matched all the other dishes. Just incredible. Loved the broth, loved the succulent scallop (just one, but I can't complain, I was stuffed by that point!), the shrimp was jumbo and the fish was perfectly cooked. And the garlic bread was excellent.Whenever anyone says things are expensive, I usually think they're talking $30 a plate. But, this place is legit expensive. Think $50 (ish) a plate. But what I can tell you is it was 100% worth it! We had leftovers for two days! Talk about an Italian hospitality. Which, by the way, the service was exceptional, but I would have expected that here. A perfect special night out, if you don't mind unbuckling a couple notches in front of your dining companion, of course!I had been wanting to come here for a very long time.  I finally ate here this past Saturday and it was awesome.  Now I can't wait to come back!First, I urge you to make a reservation because every single table was filled while we were there, and for good reason--the food is AWESOME.  The food is so good you aren't even going to feel guilty about the calories you have consumed--because you will eat A LOT OF THEM.The second thing you need to know is to show up HUNGRY.  Don't eat all day.  If possible, do what I did and work out earlier in the day, because you will leave this restaurant WELL FED.  To quote one of the great artists of our time, Ice Cube, "Life ain't a track meet, its a marathon!"It is a marathon.  They're going to bring you out delicious warm bread as soon as you sit down, and supply you with heavenly toppings for it, including the famous Holy Oil that is truly divine.  Temperance is a virtue.  Don't be like me and commit a sin against your entree by eating it when you are STUFFED, and can't fully enjoy it. because like a fool you couldn't restrain yourself with the bread bc carbs turn you into AN ANIMAL and you didn't pace yourself.You'll get all the bread you can handle.  Our waiter John, who was super nice and attentive, suggested we order the meatball appetizer and he was right.  Its huge, its literally the size of a softball and comes out wrapped in cheese, in a heavenly marinara sauce, served with love.  It was extremely good.  Then you get the salad course, which comes in a home made vinagrette which is also delicious.  Then comes the pasta course,  We had fusilli pasta in vodka sauce which was very good but at this point I was basically full and tapping out.  I ended up eating not even 1/4 of my pasta, but then the waiter offered to bag it up for me, so I had lunch for the next day.Your entree comes out after the pasta course, and you're going to be already stuffed at this point. Now, I took my friend here for his birthday.  I think they key is to come here when you are not paying, bc my bank account was crying when I saw the entrees start at $40.  More on that in a moment.I ordered the filet and it was SPECTACULAR.  I mean, amazing.  So good I did not share, and after I ate it, I fondly reflected on the time my filet and I spent together.  Temporarily in my mouth, forever in my heart.  Or on my hips.  It was not diet food, it was covered in some sort of heavenly cream cheese sauce that is the stuff dreams are made of.  It was a $60 dinner and it tasted like one too.  My friend ordered the blackened sea bass and it came out looking like a work of art.  Both our dishes were basically food porn.  He loved his dinner too and said that his fish came out topped with large chunks of crab and he loved it.We were waayyy too full to even think about dessert.  I'm sure the desserts would have been divine but we just could not do it.  In fact I ended up taking half my filet home with me.This place is technically expensive, but if you think about it, it's really not that bad.  Our bill came to $200 for the two of us, but for what you get, it's really a pretty damn good deal.  You get top notch service, the restaurant itself is beautiful, and the food is absolutely incredible.  This was probably the best meal I have had in Pittsburgh.  Oh--and you get enough food that you get a full meal the next day. I cannot believe that I had not been here before, and I will absolutely be back.

Review Text :
This is definitely the place to get cheap eats on the fly!The Need: a good lunch close to my work - hopefully one that I had not been to yet.The Restriction: $7 in singles to my nameThe Rescue:  I reached out to the Phx Yelp community on the talk boards for help with my lunch conundrum and Amanda B. came to the rescue.The Verdict:  I've seen Phoenix House of Pizza and Subs many, many times driving near my work.  Honestly, I always thought it was some sort of front for illegal activities or a place where kidnapped children were kept.  The outside isn't very appealing and the surrounding establishments in the strip mall are a little sketchy and unkempt looking.  So, by association, it wasn't on my list of places to check out anytime soon.I took a co-worker/witness with me (remember...strength in numbers) and headed to get a slice or two.  Inside was very different from the outside perception.  It is a huge space with a lot of dining tables and is very clean minus a few uncleared tables.  We each ordered two big slices - him sausage and me pepperoni, green pepper, and pineapple.  Yum!  It was cooked to order (although a tiny bit burnt) and nice and hot.  You won't find pizza that has sat under the lamps for hours on end.  There are a variety of condiments (red pepper flakes, parmesean, etc.) and they also have a few desserts.  I haven't ventured to the sub side yet - maybe next time.  What's even better?  My two custom pie slices rang in at just under $7.  Oh yeah!So, I didn't witness any illegal activities or see any kidnapped children, but I did manage to have some good eats within my budget and walking distance from my work.  Check it out if you're on a budget and in the area.

If I could give NO stars this would be the place that deserves it.  We were in on a Thursday night at around 7pm.  There were a handful of patrons(certainly more staff than paying customers).  There was one bartender who was bothered to make drinks.  We watched him make a moijto and when he poured from the shaker to the glass he spilled some over including a lime and some mint that went onto the bar, he picked them up and put them back into the cup.  DISGUSTING! Then the 4 of us at the bar were ready to order another round and the bartender went MIA, we waved down 2 waitresses who went into the back and we never saw them again, 10 minutes later he came back and when asked "what happened to you", he responded, "I am busy, I need to clean the keg lines." Don't waste you time here!

OK. I can't believe I've kept this secret for so long. I can't believe I'm about to walk out of yet another closet. But if I can help just one person...Yes. I crave. On occassion. Ok, like weekly. Filiberto's carnitas tacos. That's all I've ever had from here. Always drive thru. God forbid any of my foodie friends from yelp or chowhound see me. Two perfect little corn tortillas, filled with tender and juicy pork with a few crispy edges, cilantro and pico de gallo. Ole. I eat them in my car. With a measure of guilt and shame. But it just it makes it more exhilirating. And tastey. Ahhhh...a weight has been lifted!

After sneaking in to the Biltmore to use their hot tub for 2 hours, we needed a place to grab some food and a drink or two. Of course, it was more for me that we needed a dive-y sort of place as I had no makeup and a baseball hat covering my wet hair. Nico recommended Armadillo's and I was a fan right away. We sat at the bar and the bartender was friendly and prompt with our drinks. We ordered: *Wings in Armadillo Gold Sauce- Nico loved them *Potato Skins- soooo good! Some of the best skins I've ever had *Hummus and Pita bread- also v good. Pita was warm and toasted perfectly There were a lot of sports fans glued to the Chargers game and it was a fun atmosphere.  Definatly a place to stop in for cheap food and drinks, with or without looking like a complete scrub.

Review Text :
Um.  A little bummed.  I had high expectations, but left feeling just...meh.The restaurant is really cool looking but I was a little confused by the bar set up.  We sat at the bar because they didn't have any tables open.  I usually don't mind sitting at the bar but the stools are bolted to the floor, and about 2 feet from each other.  If you have three people with you, forget about mingling!  Also, the service was very iffy.  There was a bartender, and then a server for the bar area (or what it seemed like).  The bartender got us our drinks, but never told us a server would be with us.  I figured she was our server too.  But then some other woman came up to us all flustered.  She never introduced herself, just asked what we wanted and kept saying "okay, okay, okay."  Just very odd.  It continued that way the entire time.I tried the prix fixed brunch for $24, which includes your choice of an alcoholic bevvie (Bloody Mary, Sangria or Mimosa), appetizer and main course.  I had the mimosa, that was the perfect mix (splash of OJ:), Polenta and Eggs Beni.  The cinnamon polenta, which was delish: light, fluffy and warm with dried fruit and almonds on top.  I loved it!The Eggs Beni with smoked salmon.  It was just okay.  I kept trying to think pf what was missing and I believe it was that the hollandaise sauce had no real taste.  I expect hollandaise sauce to be rich and creamy, this was thin and blah.  I definitely want to go back and try the dinner, see if maybe I'll have a little better luck.  So kick it up a notch Casbah, you've been around for a while, but I still expect good food!One year since my first venture to Casbah, I had the chance to return for a second time. And I have to say that I am officially a die-hard Casbah fan.Yes, our dinner group quickly racked up a big bill - but it was for a birthday party, and Casbah had kindly sent along a $30 off dinner coupon beforehand. Even better, they went ahead and applied the discount even though we managed to forget to bring the actual card they had sent ahead to us. We had been completely prepared when asking about this to potentially not be able to use that $30 off at our visit, so their understanding alone would have gone a long way in making the meal a good one.The amazing food just sealed the deal. Between a table of four we all had the chance to order and then a variety of Casbah's current menu - including their scallops, arugula salad, duck, pork and veal meatballs, and a ricotta very similar to what I had ordered the last time I visited. Everything was stupendously delicious - I honestly have no other words for how good this food was - and we all left full and satisfied with no complaints.Casbah has definitely become a restaurant that I can come to for special events. Their food and service impressed me again tonight even more than they did last time; add in the fact that they use local ingredients whenever possible and always have something new to try with the changing seasons, and I'm completely sold. Here's to the next special occasion and dinner out at Casbah!Upon receipt of the much-coveted Big Burrito birthday voucher, I had to make the tough decision about which of their restaurants to visit.  I was torn between Casbah and Eleven, but upon perusing the menus, reading reviews, and giving the matter much thought, I settled on Casbah.  I knew I'd made a good decision when I invited some friends to join me, and they said that, based on their past experience, I'd made an excellent choice!Our meal started off with a few slices of bread, which came with butter and a Greek yogurt spread.  The butter was good, but the yogurt spread was amazing, and both of them dressed up the bread very well.  We then ordered an appetizer of the bruschetta, which was not your normal bruschetta, but was delicious.  I'm not entirely sure of the ingredients, since what we received doesn't match the menu description posted on the website, but one notable thing about it was that it had some pomegranate seeds that gave it a subtle sweetness and juiciness, complementing the other savory ingredients.  For my entree, I ordered the orecchiette, a dish consisting of ear-shaped pasta tossed in a goat cheese and sage cream sauce, with chicken and dried cranberries.  Flavorwise, this was one of the most well-balanced dishes I've ever eaten, with the savory ingredients and sweet hints from the cranberries (which were actual cranberries, rather than craisins, as I'd imagined) melding together in perfect culinary harmony.  The pasta was also cooked to a perfect al dente firmness, which held up well in the microwave several days later when I ate the leftovers.  The cranberry-lime dry soda that I ordered to go with this entree complemented it very nicely, and was a great alternative to wine (while I was tempted, I didn't order any since my dining companions decided not to, due to having driven).My two dining companions ordered the Scottish salmon and the gnocchi, respectively.  Based on the samples that they provided me, Casbah did a great job on these dishes, as well!  The salmon had a subtle saltiness that complemented the flavor nicely, without overpowering it.  My friend who ordered it had had it before at Casbah, but had since been to Scotland, and he said that it was very similar in quality and taste to the versions of this dish that he'd tried there.  The gnocchi was one of the most unique and varied dishes I've encountered, and, based on the two bites that I tried, brought the ingredients together in a medley of flavors and textures.  I think my friend who ordered it described it best by saying that every bite was a bit different, but that they were all delicious!  Although all of us tried bites of each other's dishes, we each liked our own choice best, so we chose well.After our entrees, we decided to order dessert.  Although I was tempted by the dark chocolate raspberry bread pudding, since many reviewers speak highly of it, I decided to follow my instinct and get the chocolate-hazelnut bomba.  I'm so glad that I did, since this dessert was amazing!  If you like dark chocolatey, torte-like desserts or Nutella, this dessert is a must-try. Since I mentioned I was at Casbah for a birthday dinner, the dessert was served with "Happy birthday" written on the plate in chocolate icing, which was a nice touch.  My dining partners ordered the creme brulee to split between themselves, which came topped with an apple compote.  Based on the bite that I tried, it was a good rendition of a brulee, but couldn't match the star power of the chocolate bomba.We visited at 7:30pm last Sun., at the later end of their serving hours, but service from our waiter, Brian, was very good.  We were seated in the tent-like area in the front of the restaurant, which stayed surprisingly warm during most of our visit.  At one point before dessert, upon returning from the restroom, I noticed that it'd cooled off, but the manager came out to turn on the heating elements, and it warmed back up in less than 10 min.In sum, if you're looking for a solid fine dining experience with innovative, delicious food, Casbah is a great choice.  The food was impressive in its quality, and the service was what I've come to expect at a higher-end restaurant.  I'd particularly recommend getting on the Big Burrito mailing list to receive a $30 birthday voucher and $10 off coupons for the holidays, and taking advantage of one of these occasions to try it.  I'm certain that you'll be as pleased with your experience there as me and my dining partners!It is DUE time to update this review. Why? Because I had a phenomenal brunch here, and it totally restored my faith in not only Casbah, but Big Burrito. I can't lie, I love what the Big Burrito group does. I think all their restaurants are awesome, but Casbah was always my least favorite. Now, I feel it is on par with the others!I love a good prix fixe brunch, and for $28 you receive a cocktail, appetizer and entree. So I started off with a mimosa (always a good start!). Then I ordered the Tomato & Basil Bisque and parmesan crostini, which was excellent. I'm very judgmental of tomato bisque, as it is one of my favorite soups. Then came the main course. Braised Lamb & Eggs: braised Elysian Fields Farm lamb shoulder, spinach, poached local eggs, tarragon, grilled sourdough. I love lamb so hard. It's by far my favorite meat, but it has to be cooked with care. This definitely had flavor, was tender and paired perfectly with the spinach and eggs. I couldn't finish my meal, so they boxed it up. I separated the sourdough and the rest of the dish so the bread wouldn't get soggy, and our server gave it to me without the sourdough. I mentioned I did that on purpose and he immediately went back into the kitchen and got me fresh bread. How nice is that?Now I'm excited to try other meals here again!I got my Big Burrito birthday meal voucher in the mail, and I couldn't decide which place to try.  I am a huge fan of Eleven and Mad Mex, but I wanted to try somewhere new.  I had previously sampled Casbah's food when they catered the dinner for Quantum Theater's production of Tamara.  I enjoyed the food at that event so I settled on coming here.The atmosphere of Casbah is really cute.  It's slightly upscale, but you will still feel comfortable in nice jeans.  There is a Mediterranean theme to the atmosphere, but I don't know that the food is themed that way, despite what Yelp says.I ordered the Lamb Macaroni and Cheese because I am a Mac and Cheese addict.  The portion was exactly lunch sized, and it came with a small salad.  The salad was really just a spring mix of lettuce with an oil dressing, but it tasted good.  The mac and cheese was delicious.  Plenty of lamb and lots of cheese.  It was on the creamy side of the mac and cheese scale.  I would order it again, but I would also like to try other things on the menu.  My friends ordered a sandwich and one ordered a bowl of soup.  The sandwich eater felt her turkey sandwich was pretty standard, but it was a turkey sandwich.  The soup eater was a fan.  Again, I plan to come back and test other things.As a side note: The catered meal I previously tried was family-style chicken with potatoes and veggies, I believe.  It was good but not what I would expect after seeing the menu for them to serve.  I think you are safe to try just about anything here, really.The only odd thing was that the servers really seemed to be fighting for tables.  Everyone was trying to get our drink and food orders, to the point of it being a touch aggressive.  Not a big deal just an observation.We went to Casbah this past Saturday.   It is my birthday month and Big Burrito offers a great deal for anyone who is on their mailing list, providing their patrons with a free entrée up to $30.00 at any of their locations beside Umi.  I chose Casbah since I have been to all of them but this one.Our reservations were early at 5pm on a Sunday.  We arrived seated quickly in their outside seating area, which is very nice.  We were brought some water while we reviewed the menu.  I decided to start with a Manhattan to drink.  It was very nice, and strong.  Next we decided to order.  Earlier I looked online at their menu and I decided I would be ordering either the Cioppino, littleneck clams, mussels, shrimp, scallops, halibut, grilled sourdough -32 or their Long Island Duck, roasted breast, braised leg, gnocchi, spinach, lavender, peaches, duck jus- 29.  I have had the duck dish at Soba before and loved it, but I wanted to try the Cioppino despite that, since I also love seafood and shellfish.  This I would discover was a mistake.  My partner got the Pork Chop dinner.  We placed our orders and waited.During our wait they brought some bread.  It was a nice touch; the bread was warm and served with two types of spreads.  By the time our entrées came I wanted another drink and asked for Boyd and Basil - 10 Boyd & Blair vodka, fresh lemon, basil, soda, Angostura bitters, this was one of their signature cocktails.  So we began to eat.  The scallops in the dish were excellent.  Perfect sear and seasoned, as well as the shrimp.  The tiny piece of halibut in the dish and I mean tiny, was so overcooked.  I choked it down but completely unappealing and tiny.  The sauce in this fish soup was also not that great.  The dish came with bread to soak up the juices but the bread itself was burnt and hard.  It actually hurt my mouth to bite it and that was after dipping it in the juices.  I was going to ask for more bread, hold the burn, but our server had not come back.  So I finished the meal and said forget it.  At this point the drink I ordered was still not delivered.  I was done eating and had to use the restroom so I told my husband if he came back without my drink to tell him forget it and just bring the check.  When I got back to the table that was indeed what happened.  Except he told him he was sorry and if we ordered dessert he would comp my drink.  So when he finally returned, he ordered the Chocolate Cheese Cake Bombe, Pinotage syrup & whipped cream, hazelnuts, praline ice cream, gastrique, when the waiter asked me I simply said no thank you, can I just have the drink I ordered?  He brought dessert and my drink and explained it was "on the house, and it was their/his fault."  No biggy really, I was way more annoyed with my meal.  I think what really bothered me was one, how small the entrée was.  It was more suited to be a lunch portion in my opinion.  And then how much it was, but I did have the coupon so I guess I can't complain that much about that.  Simply put if I had spent $32.00 on the meal I got I would have been very upset.  Lastly, the halibut was so overcooked and dry, same with the toast, and the sauce wasn't that pleasant.  All in all I wish I would have gone with the duck.  Live and learn.

Restaurant name  Alexander's Italian Bistro

Review Text :
I AM BOYCOTTING ALEXANDER'S FOR LIFE!!! The manager SCREAMED AT ME at the top of his lungs in an epic meltdown that lasted 10 minutes! On Sat., April 12, 2014, I attended the 50th birthday party for my dear friend, David Flynn. I organized the party, but relied on Dave and his sister to provide me with the final head count. I made the reservation for 25 people.The manager and I played phone tag for the two days before the event. I called back and left messages TWICE to confirm, but apparently he never got my messages. (This was part of his rant, his indignation at unreturned phone calls that actually HAD been returned!)The dinner started at 7 PM. Most of our group arrived on time, but some of our group (including me) arrived between 8 PM-9 PM. I was working on a homemade birthday present for Dave, which took longer than expected. I called Dave, his sister and my friends (Reesa & Joel) to tell them I was running late. In hindsight, I should have also called the restaurant to let them know, and for that I am truly sorry. That still doesn't justify the manager SCREAMING AT ME FOR 10 MINUTES!After enjoying a delicious dinner, drinks and birthday cake, none of us had a clue that anything was wrong. If the decision to return to a restaurant were based SOLELY on the food and wait staff, I would definitely return to Alexander's. But sadly, when the manager has a nuclear meltdown and throws a 10-MINUTE SCREAMING TEMPER TANTRUM, it tends to sour one on returning to a restaurant.Towards the end of our dinner, some of us started to smell cigarette smoke, which we later realized was coming from the patio out front. (It was a warm night, and they had the front sliding-glass doors open.) In the midst of the smoke discussion, the manager approached our table and began an EPIC RANT, SCREAMING AT ME FOR 10 MINUTES!!!He was angry that everyone in our group hadn't arrived at exactly 7 PM. The restaurant's kitchen is open till 10 PM on Sat. night, so I don't understand why this was a big deal. We ended up with 20 people total and 5 no-shows. I am always disappointed by no-shows, but I explained this possibility to the manager when I made the reservation. I STILL BROUGHT HIM 20 PAYING CUSTOMERS! BTW...the dining room was practically EMPTY, which is not what I would expect on a Saturday night in Pittsburgh. Maybe I'm not the first customer to be on the receiving end of the manager's meltdown.The manager SCREAMED that he had called me twice, and I hadn't called him back! He ranted about this about a dozen times. I told him I HAD called him back - TWICE. It's not my fault if he didn't get my messages. He SCREAMED that he had put an extra waitress and cook on staff because he expected 25 people. He SCREAMED that I had cost the restaurant $100! How much money do you think 20 people spent on appetizers, dinner and drinks? I find it hard to believe that they didn't make any money, or at least break even. I am sorry that there were 5 no-shows in our group, but I always thought Saturday night was the busiest night of the week for most restaurants. I didn't realize the restaurant would look like a deserted, old western ghost town with hardly any customers. On a Saturday night, I assumed they would have a full staff on duty with or without my reservation. I was wrong. I'm sorry. I'm not perfect.The manager also YELLED at me and my friends for "LOOKING COMFORTABLE" in his restaurant!!! Since when is looking comfortable an OFFENSE??? I thought restaurants wanted you to feel comfortable, but apparently not at Alexander's.He also SCREAMED that one of the waitresses only got a $1.00 tip! I found that hard to believe, but just in case he wasn't making it up, I tipped my waitress $35 on my $26 dinner check! I am a former waitress, and I would feel HORRIBLE if any waitress every got ripped off on my watch! Even if his story wasn't true, I figured she deserved an extra big tip just for having to WORK in such a horrible place where the manager YELLS at paying customers!!! If he treats the customers this way, I can only imagine how he treats the employees. THE MANAGER'S RUDE BEHAVIOR HAS COST HIM MY BUSINESS AND MY FRIENDS' BUSINESS FOREVER!!! During his rant, he actually SCREAMED that he never wanted to see me in his restaurant ever again! I'm happy to grant him that wish. And so are my friends. This is an example of the WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE I have ever witnessed in my entire life!!! I thought the manager was going to have a heart attack or a stroke the way he was SCREAMING FOR 10 MINUTES!SCREAMING at paying customers is completely unacceptable behavior, and I will NEVER eat at Alexander's ever again. It's really a shame because I loved their salmon with pesto sauce. But great food can't make up for a manager who throws a TEMPER TANTRUM and SCREAMS AT YOU. Also, you can smell smoke in the dining room, which sucks. My friends and I are BOYCOTTING ALEXANDER'S FOR LIFE!!!

Review Text :
Bamboo House is conveniently located on the Northwest corner of Thunderbird and 7th Street just at the foot of North Mountain.  The parking is adequate and well lit.  Access to the place is easy.Their menu is a pleasant mix of traditional Chinese food, fresh new dishes and some other Asian favorites with their own twist.  They have an good sized menu, plenty of varied choices, but not so big that you can't decide.  Their delicious lunch specials are served until mid afternoon and include egg roll, crab rangoon and a cup of soup.One of my absolute faves is their pad thai.  It has just the right amount of spicy for me, although they are happy to dial it up or down for your tastes.  They serve a dinner portion as well as a lunch portion.  The lunch special is enough for 2.... the dinner portion is enough for 2 and you can still take a doggie bag. The only noticeable difference between the lunch and dinner portion of pad thai is that they dinner portion has has shrimp as well as tofu and chicken.Other favorites of mine include their lemongrass chicken.  It has a delicious flavor and is made with the best white meat of the chicken. Mushu Chicken is wonderful.  the sauce is fresh and light. The pancakes are thin and soft.  I like mine with less green onion and more egg.  They are happy to adjust almost anything for you.Hot and sour soup is excellent, full of vegetables and meats... even shrimp.  Lettuce wraps are good, as are crab rangoon, and traditional egg rolls.I have tried most everything here.... the only dishes i won't get again were not for lack of quality, they were just not my taste.  I'm not a big sweet and sour fan, and the raspberry chicken might be more suited to someone who is. It was well prepared, just not my taste

Review Text :
Who would have thought that I'd pick a place in Champaign for my 600th review!... Well, Bacaro certainly deserves it: I finally went there for dinner last night (after wanting to go for several months), and I was wowed. I'm still salivating thinking about it.I went there with pretty high expectations (I'd heard great things about it from several friends and coworkers): that's usually not a good thing as it makes it easier to be disappointed, but Bacaro did not disappoint. In fact, I'm happy to say that my dinner there was on a par with my best dining experiences in NYC.First and foremost: the food. My boyfriend and I decided to share a bunch of dishes. For appetizers, we ordered the fresh mozzarella with heirloom tomatoes and pesto, as well as the roasted suckling pig with homemade sauerkraut: they were both absolutely delicious (don't miss the suckling pig!). We then shared one entree: we got the braised pork shank, which came with sauteed spinach, mushrooms, bacon, and fig sauce: soooo good! The portions are not huge, but two appetizers and one entree turned out to be enough food. For dessert, we got the panna cotta with fresh fruit: simple but just as outstanding. That was some seriously great food!!As Bacaro is also a wine lounge, their wine selection is quite extensive. We got a sampler of three wines by the glass for $14, all of which were pretty good. Not to forget the 10yo port we got with our dessert (very generous pour...), which was good also.Service was great, ambiance was great (although it's a shame that the place was so empty)... it was really a great dinner (sure, it was not cheap, but entirely worth it!). By far the restaurant in Champaign, in my opinion. I'll definitely be back.

Restaurant name  The Good Egg - Uptown
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
They have free wi-fi. Yes! I usually eat here when I don't feel like cooking breakfast at home or before hiking with friends.  I've always had good service here and  I don't know why people are hating the place. Our service has always been pleasant and food is good. I love that they have Stevia sweeteners instead of that dangerous pink aspartame stuff. This place is now called "The Good Egg", so maybe the bad ratings are from the Eggery. They now have Hazelnut coffee which is great and they have stamp cards for frequent guests. My friend Sage has already gotten 4 free breakfasts here 'cause they are so easy to accumulate and the breakfast prices are reasonable. I think people need to give this place another chance. It's no longer called the Eggery, so maybe the rude waitress is gone.

Restaurant name  Lombardozzi's Restaurant

Review Text :
No idea how this place is still in business.  Dad and I came in on a Thursday night.  Our waiter was the cook, bartender, and host.  For two hours, this place was deserted except for us.  A touch suspicious.I ordered a gnocchi dinner with lobster and crab in Alfredo sauce ($22.95).  There was a plethora of seafood in this dish, although it was not the best gnocchi I have ever eaten.  The Alfredo sauce was also a bit too garlicy because it lacked any other flavoring.  The entree was not bad, but it wasn't the greatest Italian food either.  The fresh bread was good.  However, I was really unimpressed with the salad.  The dressing was overly strong, and there was far too much of it.  Just an ok meal.In the future, I will definitely go to the Pleasure Bar over Lombardozzi's.  The food is cheaper and the quality of the Italian food is better.

Restaurant name  Musashi Japanese Restaurant
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
I just came back from living in Japan for two years, and Musashi is one of the most authentic Japanese restaurants I've been to. Not only that, but the prices aren't too bad either. I had some kind of vegetarian nabe (like a one pot dish) and beef tongue, my friend had the tonkatsu (fried pork cutlets-- they gave more than one, which was a surprise), and we both had a few Asahi beers and a cheap bottle of sake without completely breaking the bank (maybe about $30 a person with tip and everything).The atmosphere is nothing special. It's a small restaurant in a strip mall, but they do have a couple tables on tatami where you can sit on the floor Japanese style (if that's your thing). Personally, I'd rather have good food than a beautiful restaurant, so I didn't mind at all.All-in-all, I think I'll definitely go back next time I have a craving for ramen or some other Japanese food that's a bit tough to find in Charlotte.The key thing was that the rest of the guests were Japanese, which is always a good sign!I'm a Japanophile myself and I LOVE Musashi. As far as I know, it is the only place to find real authentic Japanese food in the Charlotte area. It has a tatami room where you can sit to eat and feel even more traditional (usually for big parties). To most, the staff doesn't seem so friendly which I think is a standard Japanese way of just staying out of your way. For me it seems they really like it when I come in and converse in Japanese with them. The cook was even nice enough to make me a special order of curry soba - which was great! I try to come back here every two weeks just to be in that authentic Japanese environment. The only setback is that I live so far from it.

Restaurant name  Qdoba Mexican Grill
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
I like coming to this Qdoba because it is close to my house and my office.  Sometimes I will come here on my lunch break or I will come here for dinner with friends on the weekend.  It is a small shop in the Central Park shopping center. My favorite thing to get here is the Craft 2,  you can pick from a variety of things.  For example you can get tacos, tortilla soup, quesadilla or a naked taco salad.  I always get two soft tacos and two hard tacos.  The downside on this Qdoba is that they are closed on Sundays and they are not open very late on Friday and Saturdays.

Restaurant name  Luke's of Chicago's
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
Damn you Luke's! I wanted to flippin' love you. They way I love Tori Spelling movie marathons on Lifetime. They way I love baby's breath in my hair after a bubble bath. And the way I love the smell of gasoline while pumping gas. Really. It's not bad for you...But Luke's, you remain a middle of the road 3 stars. The place was jumpin' around 1:30 recently. I ordered a sausage and peppers to go with cheese and a large side of fries ("more than enough he said for 2 to share). The sausage, while tasty enough, was pretty dry. Then crusty white bread had too many REALLY REALLY mushy parts. Basically half of it fell apart like my Aunt Helen did when I told her I was a mo. The crinkle fries were awesome. Crinkly and crunchy. Though not the enormous portion I anticiapted.  The large fries were $3.75 and the sandwich was $5.50. Service was spot on. Friendly and fast. I'll visit again, though I'll be sure to try a Chicago dog or Bratwurst!Stopped in here yesterday to give a try because fellow Yelper Anthony P swears by the fries and this place is so much closer to me than Port...'s (not long because the Tempe location opens Sept 10).  (I also hate to mention a competitor in my reviews, thus the abbreviation)So went with a very close and dear friend visiting me from out of town.  She wanted a Chicago-style polish sausage and it was dinner time, so what a great opportunity to stop by Luke's.  I love Italian Beef sandwiches, so Luke's was the perfect place to stop in.My friend ordered the polish sausage.  She was so satisfied with it that she wanted to go back the next day and have another.  I put a quick stop to that.   But we'll return before she leaves.  My friend said that the Polish Sausage was better than alot that she'd had in Chicago when she lived there.I had the Jr Italian Beef and whoooooooo wee.  Lemme tell ya.  That thing is amazing and the Jr is HUGE.  I had it for dinner and lunch the next day!  Definitely the best in Phoenix and quite possibly better than most that I have had while I lived in Chicago too.  The bread is quite delicious.  I'm not a big bread eater, but a little dippy-dip-dip of the sandwich in the au jus and I have to sample the bread a little bit.  See, the Italian Beef is on a very dense bread that can hold up to single, double and triple dips in au jus!  Trust me when I say this, if you don't get your Italian Beef dipped, you're missing out on something special!!!!  I also had the giardiarano peppers on my sandwich.  Those were tasty but with little to no heat.  Not the best I've had.  The star of this sandwich is quite frankly... the beef.  Where's the beef?  Oh, Luke's has got it baby.  The beef on that Italian Beef melts in your mouth real real good while exploding with mellow saltiness and HUGE flavor in your mouth.  OH!  Goodness, I could scream that beefy goodness was just delicious!  The best tasting Italian beef I've had in a long long time.  Better tasting that Port..'s.  This place is conveniently located right off the 51 on Indian School.  Very easy to locate.  Look for the sign with the little Chicago Gangster on it and the Pepsi products on the sign (they have 7UP, RC cola, etc).   It is a small place, so I would not say it is good for large groups.  But certainly you can go with a group of 6 or less and should be comfortable, provided they don't have a crowd already there.  The menu has a lot more to choose from, ever heard of a Chicago style hot dog?  Uhm yeah... i've heard Luke's dogs are good too!  They close fairly early, 8pm.So, why the 4 star, well, I docked them for the lack luster peppers and the fries.  My good Yelping buddy Anthony P swears by these fries, but the fries were just *aight* for me.  So, I had to dock them for not providing an all around amazing experience.  BUT still... my friend and I are returning this week.... for round 2.  Trust me... That thick giant beefy sandwich is worth it... and my friend likes the polish sausage too.  TWSS.Always love a good Chicago Dog and Luke's is a cool place to scarf down a couple. This location has been here for a long time and you can tell. The outside is a bit weathered with a very small eating area inside.Been coming here on and off since I moved out here. The menu has the typical Chicago favorites with the service and attitude that make you feel right at home. Giggles! Usually order one of the famous Chi-Dogs or maybe an Italian Beef with both sweet and hot peppers. The french fries here are your typical frozen crinkle cut kind and nothing special. Wish they had handcut. They are so much tastier and can be found in other Chi-town hole in the wall places around town.There are so many new Chicago restaurants in the PHX area now and some of them big chains. Luke's has lost their edge over the years. The quality of the food and the service is not as good as it was in the past and the prices keep going up. Maybe I'm just getting spoiled in my old age.Everyone has a different opinion of this place and the only way to find out is to give them a try. The parking lot is somewhat limited and a bit tricky at times. This place can definitely get really busy during peak eating hours. So get ready for a bunch of impatiant hungry people. ORDER UP!3 STARS

Review Text :
When I want to feel REALLY white, I just roll on down to Ranch Market to confirm my suspicions that, yes, I am in fact not as Hispanic as I think I am.  This store is what Food City WISHES it was!  It takes the best of Mexican specialty stores and eateries and combines it all under one roof.  Shoppers here are mostly Hispanic with a few adventurous gringos thrown in here and there.  But workers there are friendly and know English - some better than others.Holy crap!  I can't believe it's taken me so long to review this place.  I only go here ALL the time for cheap delicious down-home Mexican food, cheap produce, and Spanish rice like Grandma used to make.  I've been going to Ranch Market for about 10 years at their stores in Bakersfield -- where they first started.  I used to make fun of my mom for going to lunch here.  Heh, look who's laughing now.  I'm addicted!The food here is no-frills authentic and seats inside are picnic bench style.  It's not uppity Mexican fare like Barrio Cafe, but it's not Filiberto's diarrhea fare either.  Everything from chile colorado, chile verde, calabasitas, sopes, mole,  tortas, carnitas, chicharrones, tamales, ceviche.  You name it, they have it.   And that's just in the deli.  They have a panaderia with all kinds of cakes, flans and pandulce (sweet bread).  I LOOOVE pandulce.  They even have a jugeria (juice bar) tortilleria, and a counter for fresh cheeses and cremas. And the produce?  Cheap and abundant.  I got some bananas and tomatoes just a little over one dollar.  Don't think about getting any organic veggies here.  This isn't the place.  This is also not the place for low-fat shopping either.  But it is so many other great things that the other stores aren't.Best of all is the atmosphere inside - it is REALLY festive - like you're at Tia and Tio's fiesta.  Mariachis and bands abound here during the weekend.   Dang!!   Fry's, Safeway, Basha's - take note, por favor.  You're on notice.Best place to go when you are feeling blue!As a fresh new transplant to the area who knows absolutely no one besides her beyond retired neighbor who hits the pillow by 4pm, I often find myself slightly lonesome.  Instead of watching another episode of entourage, I decided to see if you yelpers were right....THIS PLACE IS AMAZING!Not only were my new Mexican friends staring at me because I was the only white gal in sight, but probably because I was beaming from ear to ear!  From the outrageous meat section to the beautiful bakery I think I could easily spend a whole day there.  The store was extremely easy to find and for a whopping $1.88 I left with a gigantic cucumber, 2 over-sized oranges and at least 2lbs of grapes!  Great place, cant wait to go again!TRAVEL ALERT/ALERTE DE VIAJE: The State Department wants you to know about new travel restrictions for entering and exiting countries subject to the Western Hemisphere Travel Initiatve, including Mexico. As of June 1, 2009 travelers must possess either a passport, passport card, or WHTI-compliant identification to enter the US by air, land or sea. Contrary to popular belief however, Americans will be able to visit the Phoenix Ranch Market without documentation.GENERAL DESCRIPTION/DESCRIPCION GENERAL: Phoenix Ranch Market III is an upmarket Mexican-style mercado complete with an interior food court called "La Cocina" (The Kitchen). It is located in a rather unpleasant part of town, but manages to attract a large following of gringos eager to inject some diversity into their palette without risking turista.THE FOOD/LA ALIMENTACIN: Offerings in "La Cocina" run the gamut from Mexican style tortas, to more iconic tacos and burritos. Many items offer a choice of meat, from ham to carne asada, to carnitas. A separate area offers various seafood dishes. Everything is ala carte, suprising those hoping to economize using an American style "combo".  Despite this, "La Cocina" remains popular, especially at lunch time.SERVICE/SERVICIO: All orders are taken by an attendant standing next to the line for the cashier. Most guests do not wait long before placing the order. Some have reported difficulty communicating with the attendant however, the other employees tend to have command of the English language. Visitors are responsible for retrieving their own orders and seating themselves at long bench-style tables. PRICES/PRCIOS: Like Mexico itself, the Ranch Market is not the bargain it is made out to be. Prices that may look low for entrees quickly increase when adding in the cost of beverages, churros, and gas. Most respondents however, believe that the mercado occupies an important niche between true fast food and more sophisticated self-serve meals. SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS/CONSIDERACIONES ESPECIAL: Some have accused the Phoenix Ranch Market from being too acommodating to non-Latino customers. While this concern cannot be dismissed, it is obviously the case that all of Mexico has fallen to this trend. New hotels now gleam along the shoreline in Puerto Penasco, golf courses spourt in the arid desert outside Cabo San Lucas, all while Costcos can be found in such tourist-heavy states as Veracruz and Guanajuato. The Calderon Government and America's Hispanics will have to confront the tension between assimilation and authenticity one agua fresca at a time.If Ranch Market is not your thing-- then you are missing out on some really great things.  1.  Chips  (as in chips and salsa)-- they make their own tortilla chips that are only 99cents for a bag.  I brought them to a work party and everyone liked me more than the day before.2. Birthday cakes for kiddies--- wow- talk about a frickin' cool Dora the Explorer cake, or a Spongebob cake-- it put Costco and Aunt Cindy to shame.3.  Meat-- this meat case is LOADED, even if you don't want to buy fresh meat, just go there to look at it. 4.  The affordabiltiy-- C&H Sugar was $1.19 at Ranch Market and $2.99 at any other grocery (non sale priced).  It's like a party in this place, the last time I was there was right before the holidays and I found myself just having a good ol' time grabbing the chips for a work party.  I even stopped by the jewelry counter and contemplated purchasing a 3 inch gold cross, but decided against it.  :o)This place is as exciting as going to Disneyland if you're not used to Hispanic markets! The sights, the smells, the lights, the colors, and the chaos had my head whipping back and forth all evening. We started off with dinner in the cafe inside the market - just $5.99 for 3 street tacos, beans, and rice - and it totally filled me up. I washed it down with a Mexican coke in a glass bottle and it took me back to my childhood to the days before corn syrup became the norm. After eating, we took our time perusing the aisles and examining the foods foreign to us. They have a beautiful produce department and the prices were great on both the more exotic items like fresh papaya's to the staples like tomatoes and lettuce. The meat department is a carnivore's dream come true. Loads of fresh ground beef, pork, and poultry at very fair prices. I had to laugh at the ground pork in the glass case and wish I'd brought my camera. The butcher shaped it into a pig head - complete with a snout - and put cucumber slices for eyes. Not something I'd expect to see at my local gringo Fry's.Shopping here was a real cultural experience tonight and I can't wait to tuck into the treats we brought home!Oh the joy of walking thru Ranch Market... loved the produce section . lower prices , bigger bunches of cilantro , onions and other goodies...pineapples for 2lbs for .99 ? Yes please!  With my buddy Tom as my guide we perused and discussed  all foods  Hispanic.. we talked cremas, with me buying something close to a creme fraiche,  and a arroz conleche that might make stop by there every time I am near..that is some good rice pudding.  We also  looked over their large selections of  dried chiles  for my chili carne I am working on.   My husband  found yummy morsels of ceviche  to his liking and he also tried a  variety of streets tacos.   Loved this adventure in food and look forward to going back ..Hello Ranch Market, nice to finally meet you ! Since moving to my new hood I have fallen in love with this store. They have things I have never seen before anywhere else. I am so overwhelmed when I go here, I am in sensory overload.Mexican bread is 5 for $2, bolillos are 6 for $1, tons of seafood, fresh chorizo ( which I have been eating everyday for a week ), tons of snacks packaged by Ranch Market for super cheap, you can get a meal for 4 people for $10 ( carnitas, rice, beans, tortillas ) and tons of other specialty items. The atmosphere is fun and inviting and everyone is friendly. This store has inspired me to create new dishes at home, like my homemade beans and chorizo. Go here, eat some of their prepared foods that are inexpensive and delicious OR get some fresh ingredients and make something yummy at home.See ya soon Ranch Market.It was a scorcher. Certainly one of our famous triple digit days, and as I sat in the passenger seat, bumming a ride from mi amigo, Vicente, I couldnt shake my contempt for his leather seats. We drove down Roosevelt in the Garfield district towards Ranch Market, on the way discussing the Alwun house, Rito's, and some colourful housing that we both agreed leant to the overall gentrification of the neighborhood. The grounds of this place are sprawling, palatial in fact. I was completely ripped and had on a pair of imitation wayfarers that had a broken arm and kept sliding off my face with the least possible movement of my head.  Endeavoring not to break them further I held my head at rigid attention my back was grammar school like in posture. I then realized how arrogant and white I must've looked, in my mind I fantasized I was a conquistador with a local Toltec guide showing me the ins and outs of the Aztec village we were entering, then I kinda got sick of that phantasy and pictured myself as a balmy Harrison Ford intrepidly following Albert Molina through an alternate ruinous Mayan temple, all the while expecting danger and betrayal at every corner. I probably looked half insane as some of the patrons looked at me oddly, giving me a wide birth. Entering the place it's just as big inside. It's like costco and food city had a wild passionate tequila filled tryst and gave birth to the Eva Longoria of grocery stores. Vicente and I immediately split up, probably not the best of ideas, but I wanted to explore and he was eager to do the same. I quickly snatched up the worst shopping cart in the store (you know the one with a bad front wheel and sticky grip) and let my stomach guide me. Two gallons of horchata. check. Exotic mozzarella style cheese from Oaxaca and  some delicious salty Cotija. check. A lb. of plantains. check. Mango's, apples, dried pinto beans, sugar snap peas, string beans, potato's, roma tomato's- check!  Grocery shopping while intoxicated can get a little quixotic, and confusing to say the least. I hadnt the slightest clue what I was going to make, but the colors of the produce were certainly alluring. Finally Vicente caught up with me and laughed gutturally upon seeing my hodge podge of a shopping cart. I stared thru him with glazed eyes as I espied the "cafeteria". I abandoned my shopping cart and slowly walked over, intriguiged, literally beguiled by the aroma of cooked meats.  I hadnt the slightest clue what most of it was, and what broken Spanish I know certainly wasnt helping with most of the dishes behind the glass, until bingo; Carnitas. There was a word I knew and loved, I stared at the "meat" not quite convinced I knew what I was looking at. Sure it said carnitas, but this was...well...it resembled a tamarind bean, but was much longer, and had a color ruddy and blackish, certainly most unappealing. The tube like meat sat coiled amongst itself like tentacles in a brackish water. I stared at it hypnotized, until a young Mexican attendant came to take my order.  "Hey man what you want?" he asked, breaking the glamour that held me entranced. "...a half a pound of this..." I said unsteadily. He looked at me almost impressed, and half cautiously. As he deflty grasped a pair of tongs and started sloshing the meat back and forth in it's brackish juices, attempting a better grip, it looked more alien to me than ever. I was beginning to come to my senses out of a stupor, and it was slowly dawning on me what this was. In a slightly horrified and hoarse whisper I leaned over the counter and looked him in the eyes and asked, "Wait, wait......what is this...stuff!?" Then he said, grinning a knowing, mocking grin, "Yoo don' know whad tis is and yoo wanna poun' of eet man?"  Just then Vicente strolled up casually behind me and saw what I was doing, the two exchanged a brief chuckle as apparently Vin had overheard the attendant's query. "Trrrriiipa!" Vicente exclaimed, using his dormant mexican accent that usually only comes out when drunk or speaking with his parents, to which the attendant grinned and nodded enthusiatically. Aghast, I stepped back in revulsion, I'd nearly ordered a pound of pigs intestines.I felt profoundly embarassed, never more had I shown off the "pinche gringo" side of my personality than in that moment.  I ended up just ordering some pork ribs that'd been marinated in a chile sauce, along with the ubiquitous spanish rice and refried beans. I love ranch market, but I'm certainly not going back until the raspberry of embarassment lightens.This place is the place to go for when you plan to throw a BIG MEXICAN/LATIN FIESTA!!! Si, si, si!!!!! :) :) They are awesome, It reminds me of Mexico and its Open-aired local markets. Great prices, freshly made corn Tortillas and its also the perfect place to request freshly grounded masa. Thats if you know how to make Tameles from scratch. I have never dined there, but food looks good!!  I LOVE THE AGUAS FRESCAS!!! OH SOO AMAZING Horchata, Fresa, Sandia and Papaya water!!!! :) YUM, YUM!!!Great service, big smiles everywhere and a large variety of products and produce!!I was completely skeptical about Phoenix Ranch Market when my wife said we were going to go check it out last week, so skeptical that I told her I didn't want to go, in all honesty... what could possibly be so good about a little grocery store in a not particularly good part of downtown Phoenix after all? EVERYTHING. Prices lower than Walmart, the largest selection of 89 cent pastries I've ever seen, several small "restaurants", full cows heads for only 49.99, a vast selection of specialty items most grocery stores don't carry much of (Hispanic stuff, fruits, vegetables), plus, it's probably the most clean grocery store I've ever been in. While we don't live close enough to make this our go-to grocery store, I can guarantee you'll see us here several times a month from now on. Five big fat ones for sure.

Miguel's has all the things I like:  delicious food, good drinks and candy!The servers are courteous, but tend to work fast and you tend to have multiple people waiting on you, so you don't really get attached to any particular one... One guy brought us the complimentary chips and salsa (which was delicious! The chips were hot and perfectly salted.  The salsa tasted fresh with a really nice kick to it.).  A lady came to take our drink orders and brought them back to take orders and a different guy brought our food out... All of them were nice, but I have no idea what their names are... The margaritas are definitely worth a taste, if that's your thing... The medium is the size of a Presidente from Chili's, for comparision's sake...  So the large is an investment... lol  They have a number of specials for lunch and dinner... My favorite is the beef burrito with rice and beans... It's perfect for a light lunch, but still filling...So, I'ma go ahead and tell you: this place looks sketch as hell, but put that aside... This is one of those things about not judging a book and blah, blah... The inside is clean, the food is super tasty, the specials are great, they sell old school penny candy at the register and the drinks are good... What more do you want?So Miquel's is definitely a perfect definition for a "Hole in the Wall" but let's be honest those places clearly have the best food. As a self proclaimed Mexican fanatic I was excited to see just what this place had to offer. We started with the chips and salsa and they were classic. The chips were warm and crispy and the salsa had just the right amount of kick! My friends and I ordered a little bit of everything...fajitas, shrimp quesadillas, tacos, rice and beans. Everything was delicious...and the portion sizes were perfect! Add to that good service and super reasonable prices! I'm absolutely coming back.

Tired of the loud and over-crowded bars and clubs? Tired of over-hearing the stupidest conversations known to man? Tired of people who give a rat's ass about their waist size and designer shoes? Allow me to introduce you to Keegans. So many spots around the Valley will be crowded, loud, filled with obnoxious people. When you feel like going out but not battling your way in the door or fighting for a table, consider Keegans. Even on a Friday evening, there's plenty of room for you. I can't vouch for their food, though the menu offers some pretty appealing sandwiches, burgers, salads and apps. Best of all, I like the laid back atmosphere of their patio. Sure, it shares itself with a parking lot, basically, that grants you a view of busy Camelback Road or the hustle of Delux. But, while people are zipping in and out of traffic or waiting at least an hour for a seat, you relax without a care in the world. In a way, you're flippin' the finger to all those prissy pansies who think cramming into Delux for dinner is an ideal way to waste a night away. Try the Sundog Amber Wheat. They have this chilled and ready for you. It's a damn fine wheat beer, if you ask me. (Definitely a new fave.)When I'm in the mood to go out but to still be removed from the annoyances of people, I'll return to Keegans. It gets my seal of approval. After all, what a novel concept: I can hear what my companion is saying!I love going anywhere I'm the youngest one in the joint. Okay, not the youngest, but the youngest customer. Keegan's is a great neighborhood restaurant that puts out honest pub grub. No fancy, deconstructed shit here. You want potato skins, you got it! You want saffron dusted potato croquettes with bacon infused butter? Go somewhere else fancy boy!! They have a wide range of items on the menu and their specials are always worth the visit. Meatloaf day is one of the better ones! Just like Mom's. My list of favs1. Beer (I know you can get that anywhere, but I like the bar here, great bartenders)2. Potato Skins (Duh, I talked about them earlier)3. Calihan Cobb (Basically took a couple meats and mixed it in with some greens. Nothing wrong with that)4. Turkey Burger (Better than Delux, need I say more)5. Any of their cobblers On St. Paddy's day they put up a strong corned beef! Just a wee bit of info for ya.

So....what do you say when a highly rated place let's you down??  It was okay....When a meal rocks my world, I usually want to lick the bowl clean, yes, like a dog.  I did not, sadly, feel that way about this place.  It IS BYOB but the catch is it's $4 PER glass.  Yep, that's right, not per table my friend.  Keep that in mind.I got the greens and beans on recommendation from many Yelpers on here.  Maybe I just don't have the taste for it, but I thought it was weird, watery and....not good.  I also thought it was going to be green beans and it was kidney beans and spinach that tasted like a warm Caesar salad.  No thanks....I ordered the Penne Vodka, which is my fav meal to order at Italian restaurants.  I also like to add a meatball on if it's homemade.  It was, in fact, confirmed to be homemade so I was all over it!  The meatball itself was delicious.  I love a bread-y meatball.  You know the type.  Soft and packed with flavor.  It was the winner of the night.  The vodka sauce was good, but I wanted way more.  Now I have to preface this by saying I'm a total sauce-aholic.  I love me a good amount of sauce, this didn't even come close.  Then I looked over at Serena R's plate, and her ravioli (which I thought was the same) was SWIMMING in it!  So I stole some of hers....Would I come back?  If someone really wanted to.  But I have a hunch there's way better Italian places to dine at in the Burgh...so now I'm on the hunt!  I gotta connect with my roots, ya' know?

Restaurant name  Hartigan's Irish Pub

Review Text :
This bar is not too far from where I work.  I was told by a friend that it was a gay bar, but had pretty decent food.  I walked there one afternoon.  It has a brick exterior and the interior looks like any old Irish pub, nothing overtly gay about it at all (what a change from SF gay bars).The bartender was friendly.  She quickly told us the specials and we had some bottled beer for I think only $1.50 each or something crazy like that.  This isn't' just a happy  hour special either, but I think it's all day.We decided to try the other special that day, 35 cent chicken wings.  We ordered ten and the cook delivered them himself, plenty of napkins, side plates and blue cheese dressing.  Surprisingly, the wings looked great.  What's more they tasted pretty darn delicious.  They were a good size, meaty, slightly crispy here and there and the heat of the sauce was just right.  Can you believe it only cost $3.50 for 10 wings?  They have different daily specials, so check out their website.It was quiet during our late lunch, we were the only ones there, but the place is pretty comfortable (booths, tables, bar, TVs, etc.).It's a hidden find, that's worth checking out.It is somewhat interesting seeing a bar named "Hartigans" - obviously an Irish name, with a menu to match - come up in a category labeled "gay bars".  Not, as Jerry Seinfeld so eloquently put it several years ago, that there is anything wrong with that.When you visit, you will see that the physical bar fits the name of the place, and you should feel immediately welcomed.  The wood stretches the length of the place, from the entrance almost to the end of the upper floor.  And yes, there is a lower floor, which is perhaps where the other aspect comes into play.Head downstairs and you get more of a club atmosphere, with pool tables, space for dancing and yes, cages.  Or cage.As you might expect, an Irish Gay Bar does have a menu, and it is interesting, sporting items such as the Dirty Gertie, the Monte Christa and the Toora Loora Loora.  At the suggestion of the bartender, I went with the Monte Christa - hot ham, turkey and swiss cheese with light raspberry vinaigrette on grilled texas toast - and you know what?  It was fab-u-lous.  Or I was.The place is definitely a bit of a paradox, if you have not figured that out already, but we could use more of that around these parts.

Review Text :
Just Not For MeThe staff at Juan's Authentic Mexican Food is warm, friendly, and extremely accommodating, which is why I feel terrible for calling out their Mexican food as bland. I really wanted to like Juan's so badly, especially after reading so many positive reviews. However, the food in my opinion just isn't good.This was my second visit to Juan's Authentic Mexican Food Restaurant, and for me the food is just so-so. Just one step above what you would be served in a fast food establishment.I enjoy starting my meal with chips and salsa just like everyobe else.  The salsa at Juans is like a watery tomato puree posing as salsa and the chips tasted stale. For my entrée I choose the Beef Flatas and Mexican rice, both of which had very little taste.  The meal was just very disappointing and took over 30 minutes to serve.Juan's isn't the worst but I'm not in a rush to visit again

If you're a picky sushi eater, don't waste your time here... it may be cheap, but the service and quality reflect that.Somehow, I managed to spend about $25 on my dinner there tonight, even with happy hour pricing.  I know, it's not so bad for sushi... but the service was extremely off, and the sushi was just meh.I'd been before and I'm sure I'll go again, just with the expectations in check next time.I shared an order of yellowtail sashimi, an I also had a seaweed salad (it was violet in color - have you ever seen that before?), a scallop handroll (generous in serving size but way too creamy for my liking), and an order of ikura.  We sat in the bar area... it was fine for a casual dinner with friends, but nothing fancy at all.  There are much better sushi places to choose from - even in AZ!The absence of flaw in beauty is itself a flaw.I was in Phoenix for 17 hours a couple of days ago.  It was a perfectly warm day outside, one of those beautiful early fall days in the desert when the sun bathes everything in clear, comforting sunlight.  It felt great just walking around Kierland Commons in the warm, late afternoon sunshine. My friend chose her favorite sushi restaurant in Phoenix, Shogun, for dinner.  We got there fairly early and sat at the sushi bar.  Looking around, I noticed that I was the only Buddhahead in the restaurant (and I'm only half-Asian).  "This can't be a good sign", I thought.  Don't' get me wrong:  I don't believe that a restaurant operator's ethnicity must match the culinary heritage of the food he serves.  This can't be right.  Food, like human compassion and friendship, transcends race and ethnicity.  My friend ordered most of the items off the menu.  We started with a Sunshine Roll, which was heaping mounds of spicy tuna loaded onto a modified California Roll.  The sauce for the spicy tuna was heavily mayonnaise based, which was a bit odd.  It was different, but tasty and original.The Wahoo Sashimi in ponzu sauce with sliced cucumbers was light and delicate.  Wahoo is ono in Hawaii and is a white fish that is mild and slightly sweet.  It went well with the citrus ponzu.  The Veggie Roll was odd in that the ingredients didn't blend together at all.  It consisted of cooked asparagus, some kind of weird takuan (pickled daikon radish) that was a bit bitter, kimpira gobou (burdock root), and shisou (mint leaf).  All the wasabi and gari in the world couldn't fix this roll. We also had Shake Sushi (Salmon Sushi), Octopus Salad, and some edamame.The sushi here was so far off the beaten path that the tastes were a bit off, they were almost uncomfortable to my palate.  But, it's good to try different styles of food in different settings.Food doesn't have to be perfect, or authentic, to be enjoyable.

Review Text :
Chile Relleno plate was pretty good here the beans were good the rice was meh. The chips and 2 diff salsa's were good tasted fresh. It didnt take long and Horchata was good! All in all I will stop here again and try some other dishes since its really close to my new pad!Mi Pueblo is a small place tucked into a strip mall off of 7th St and Union Hills. It has been there for at least 6 years that I know of. I wanted something Mexican ish for lunch today and needed to try a new place. I was greeted by a nice girl and looked around a bit. They have 30 combo lunches/dinners pictured on the wall. I did not see any other type of menu. I asked about the Green Chili and she said it was good. They offer a chip bar with 2 types of salsa and the carrots in hot stuff. LOL The salsa was a fresh tasting red salsa and a roasted chili green type both were good and complimented the chips perfectly. The burrito was a generous size and was covered in green sauce and cheese with sour cream on the side. The in-nerds were flavorful and plentiful, the pork was tender and nice sized chunks. (I did have one fat hunk) The beans were good and the rice was OK. It tasted like a nutty taste some how. ?? right around $7 and I could not eat it all.Decided to come by and check out this local mom and pop restaurant. It is close to my house and on the way to pickup my granddaughter. She is so much fun.Located in the same complex as Good Will and right next to a popular donut chain. This little restaurant serves up a good variety of the more popular Mexican dishes.Inside is very small with several tables and chairs to enjoy your meal. The menu has a good selection of photos so that you can just point at what you want to eat. They even have a nice complimentary chip and salsa bar to get you started.Ordered the Green Chili Pork Burrito Combo plate and helped myself to both the mild and hot salsas. The burrito tasted OK and seemed to be filled mainly with beans and green chili gravy. The cubed pork seemed to be hiding and required a bit of searching to find the rather small pieces. This place more or less cranks out some very typical Tex-Mex style food with not a whole lot of flavor. Even the salsas were pretty bland and I had to add a large amount of hot sauce to kick things up a notch.Service was friendly and the place was pretty busy. I would not call this authentic Mexican food unless you are just used to the Americanized versions of this cuisine. The prices are reasonable and the food in general falls into my  A-OK category.Give them a try and see what you think. Everyone has a different opinion of what they enjoy when it comes to Mexican food. LEFT STILL HUNGRY!3 STARSNot Bad.....Not Bad At AllI was expecting Mi Pueblo Mexican Food to be the typical Mexican fast food. Boy was I wrong.  Mi Pueblo is a step above the rest.Lets start with the complimentary hot chips and salsa. Many Mex style recipes give you those cheap paper thin tasteless chips but not Mi Pueblo. These chips are lighy, crispy, and flavorful and  salsas are really tasty.On this visit I ordered the grilled chicken taco plate and I  not  disappointed. The chicken was moist, seasoned, and loaded with flavor. The chicken tacos came with a homemade "dressing" not sure what it was. All I know it was really good.Even though I was completely full from.my meal I couldn't leave without trying dessert.  So I decided to try the  sopapillas which come drizzled with honey and powdered sugar and a scoop of vanilla ice cream on the side, it was delicious.Good food, inexpensive meals, and great customer.  I will be back.

This is actually the first time I have ever been to a Waffle House. My husband's cousin talks about going here all the time, so I had to check it out.Our server was friendly and she even was able to incorporate the phrase " sausage fest " into our brief conversations. In other instances this would have annoyed me because of how inappropriate it was in this setting, but while staring at her huge pregnant belly, I could do nothing but laugh.The food was not good. The sausage gravy was way too salty, eggs were way under-cooked, waffles were average, coffee was alright ( served in a lipstick stained mug the first go around ), sausage and bacon were below average, hash browns were limp, mushy, and flavorless.I would only return to a Waffle House if this was my ONLY option.

Sounds of stirring, lunchnears and my appetite waitsmy neighbor enters.Quick we drive to itA simple place but look-busy!Still no wait to sit.Varied menu greets usI choose the daily specialFood like its home-made.Service is friendly.Order comes quickly to you,Owners always smile.Soon it's time to gomy thoughts turn food away, but lookmy wallet not empty.Hands down the best teryaki in the world. i'm really not exagerating. this place is awesome. i have been going to blue fin off an on for the past 20 years. i remember as a child going to florance crittenden after getting a teriyaki bowl with half a salad. every chance i get i drop by this place. the teriyaki bowls are serious. not skimping on portions at all. and if you seriously off a diet, they have double meat portions. :D    i like the dark meat chicken version. drop on a heavy sprinkling of the hot powder and some black sesame seeds. OMG!!! the best in the world.  the Panko chicken is my second favorite dish. the egg rolls are great. the owners are always great, cheerful and ready to chat you up. i was so glad to hear this place was spared the wreaking ball. i would have chained myself to the door if it came to it. inside is cute and hasn't changed..in forever. i am serious. ever.getting to it is tricky now. and parking is just as tricky. but its worth it. SOOOO WORTH ITYay for me, they open at 10:30am.  Service quick and helpful. Owner (I think) was present and seemed to know quite a few of the regulars. I had the panko chicken with an egg roll. Both were simple, yet above average. Quite a selection for such a small place.  All of the items I saw were pretty big or almost too big for a single serving.  Prices are a buck or two more than you might pay for at your average rice bowl shop, but it's worth it.I'll be back. Soon.This is one of the restaurants that is close to my hotel. I came here for a quick snack. I ordered the Teriyaki Chicken Katsu lunch Bowl. For $5.50+ tax, I get two pieces of Chicken Katsu drenched in Teriyaki Sauce. Unfortunately, I find the chicken pieces not too fresh and unbearable to eat. Though a nice size snack for me, but I find the bowl very unsatisfying. My rice bowl: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/oMBNvB6tHlwW3UwGBYqljw?select=63adwMUXsZA0hS2VsQJaqwWith locals enjoying this restaurant and the high-rating, the restaurant has the Yelp Sticker posted on the diner's door. I'm not too sure if this place deserves the famous red-sticker!Maybe I'm spoiled, because I live in San Francisco/Bay Area and get better rice bowls from places like Kaz Teriyaki and Suruki Supermarket (both located in Downtown San Mateo). This is probably one of the better places Phoenix has to offer.This is a wonderful establishment, and easily the best Japanese fast food restaurant in our city.My review isn't even necessary, as I think the Blue Fin can speak for itself, 99% of the people that come here will leave satisfied.I've found that small dedicated local busineses like this usually engender nothing but respect and praise from their community; but every once in a while you'll get a certain someone who for whatever reason is going to go on the record publicly and trash a place that is beloved by the majority.I wasnt even going to write this review until I saw the egregious 1 star rant that this type of person wrote previously. So, rather than a review proper, this is more of a review coupled with a response to that baffling 1 star atrocity below. If your the type of person who will shell out 1 and 2 star reviews to mom and pops earnestly trying to serve their community and build a sustainable business, but give 5 star reviews to places like el pollo loco and ross; than please dont come here. you'd be better off in your $15 elastic waste band pants eating greasy chicken in your honda pilot.post script:SEA WEED SALAD IS KING HERE!Cute little place with great teriyaki!!Business owner is a very nice older lady, she cheerfully walks around the tables to check if everything is well.   The Service is outstanding, teriyaki was delicious with rice and veggies. Also if you get a large drink, you get unlimited refills! Yay for raspberry tea!! Great small business with good food and great service. Its a must visit if  you're around the area!! :)I was planning to go to a party but it was cancelled and since I didn't have much to do on that day, I decided to try a taste of Japanese cuisine this time.Took me awhile to find a good restaurant and later chose this one. Place is nice and has feel good vibes in it. Great for some fine food to eat. I ordered a California roll, shrimp tempura and a seaweed salad. The salad was indeed fresh and tasty but it was in small portions. The shrimp tempura was good and as for the rolls, they were delicious! It was indeed worth it every penny spent here. Might come back here and try out the other dishes they have on their menu.ok, what is wrong with me? I want to love this place like everyone else does but when it comes to the food I can't quite get behind it. I want to love their slightly smokey tasting chicken teriyaki but I can't help but feel that it is more than a little dry. I want to get behind their oyako bowl but I am just not super fond of the onion crowded omelette. If I were rating it just on service and sweetness of staff it would get 5 stars in my book though!

I used to come to this place before I found out about other Korean places around campus. Each place has their own specialties. I love getting the bibimbap and bulgogi from here. In my opinion, the soon du bu doesn't have much flavor. I started coming less and less because the owner at this place isn't too friendly. Also, once I came to get food and saw them refilling the water dispenser with a tub that didn't look so sanitary...made me lose my appetite.

What a nice treat! The bread, to start, was fresh and seasoned with Italian herbs, and served with olive oil & red pepper flakes, yummy! The shrimp and crab risotto was delicious, creamy & buttery, a true risotto. We also ordered the Pollo Alla Griglia, a seasoned grilled chicken, served with mashed potatoes & the vegetable of the day, which I substituted for the grilled asparagus, delish! The service was great and the wine selection perfect! An enjoyable evening in the patio, and somewhere we will return!

Mama Mia! Fast food Italian. Who woulda thunk it? Well. Somebody incompetent and passionless. I would rename this place Yuckoli's. Fits better. I knew I was treading on dicey turf going to this joint. But it was in Rickie's old hood and the culinary establishments were limited to fast food and chain restaurants. So I went basic with spaghetti and meatballs (oh God, really, for the love of balls, these circular beef objects were filled with some sawdust like material and blander than Jennifer Aniston's movie career). Not good. We also tried a chicken Alfredo like dish that apparently was made with Elmer's glue. Pasty. Bland. And, yes, it does stick to construction paper. I wasn't expecting much. But I wasn't expecting to be grossed out. All I can say is "Mama Mia, papsa a pee'ah, daddy's got the diarrhea". There. That's classy. And Elite of me. Don't ya think?

Review Text :
They get an automatic bump to 4 stars for brazenly being the only malaysian joint in town. Despite being all over the map (sushi, chinese, malaysian, thai, japanese) Cuisine Malaya does really well (as in, authentic) with some stuff, pretty well with the rest. Decent prices + me being able to sit down and have decently executed cuisine from 4 different asiatic countries for dinner = awesome.The lunch menu is limited but still very veg friendly. Dinner is where its at. I love malaysian curry (well, curry of any kind, really) and the Curry Vegetable Chef's special hits the spot. Okra and eggplant, tomato, tofu, green beans, yes yes. Oily, smokey curry and delicious coconut milk, yumm. Unless you're ravenous, the 11$ will be well spent, as you'll have lunch for the next day. And we all know curries improve overnight ;) They have both Thom Kha and Hot n Sour veg options, both soups I adore. Tofu can be added/subbed to almost anything here.All the sushi I've had has been perfectly prepared, with good ingredients. The rolls aren't 80% rice, 20% stuff. They're also flexible about ingredients, something a lot of places are not (have them make you a vegetable tempura roll - delicious).I wish they had coconut rice, and gado gado. I don't get the "shrimp sauce" served with the hibachi items (a mixture of what tasted like mayo and ketchup, yikes). For my malaysian curry fix, however... I'm stoked they're here.Curry Laksa: Can we say delish? Even I, the Asian guy needs a break from the run of the mill Chinese, Japanese or Thai food. That's where Cuisine Malaya comes in. Malaysia contains a plethora of Asian ethnicities, and each culture's influence can be readily seen in the food. It goes a little something like this: Chinese food has Indian influences, Thai food has Muslim influences, Indian food has Chinese influences and somewhere in that hodgepodge is a little Indonesian and something like that. To the novice, this might seem like just another Asian food joint. To the veteran eater, it's so much more. Now the food might look similar, but I can assure you, it tastes completely different. That's what Malaya is. Many of the dishes looked so familiar to me it made me nostalgic. Once I had a taste though, I had a "WTF" moment, but in a good way.

Meh.Can't believe I'm going to say this... but...So, forget Cheuvront. Just go to Kazmirez.Atleast at Kaz, you get ample variety when you order the fruit/cheese tray. At Cheuvront, you get a minute amount of cheese (only two types) with hardly any fruit or nuts. Forget it. Not worth it. Not after having Kazmirez fruit/cheese tray. Nothing else can compare. I tried a Viogner by the glass, and it was the worst Viogner I've ever had. Also good to know: their bottle service is pricey. You can guy a $17 bottle of wine there and take it to go (good deal) or pay $35 for the same bottle to drink it at the restaurant. Uhmm... wow. I feel for my date. He bought a glass of wine, 1 bottle of wine and 1 small cheese/fruit tray and it come to around $100. That, my friends, is the definition of absurdity.Oh dear god, I'm in love...Peppered Filet and Martini Scallop dreams fill my mind. Blue Cheese stuffed olives in my martini?? what?? shut the fuck UP!! Sooooo amazing. Quality all the way. I had a glass of Byron Pinot Noir (fabulous) then a white chocolate martini for desert. (I prefer to drink my desert). Great romantic spot to bring a date. Secures that you will be getting action later, trust me. If you see me at Cheuvront stop by and say hello. I'll be the one in the corner making sweet love to the macaroni and cheese..... no joke.This is where Marie Antoinette would eat, were she a contemporary Phoenician and not a deposed French ruler from the eighteen century. Total decadence. Total indulgence. Totally wrong but oh-so-right. Brunch: cheese plate, eggs Benedict in a spicy hollandaise, Gruet mimosa. Lunch: cheese plate, burger with dry jack cheese and pancetta on ciabatta, sweet potato fries, gin-cucumber martini.Oh my god, the cheese list. I really hope I never become lactose intolerant. Because I don't think it would stop me from devouring cheese plates like they're going out of style, but it would make the aftermath upsetting. Anyway, their list is robust and I've yet to try something I don't like. The Roaring '40s blue is excellent. Idiazabal was like a Spanish manchego, but smokier. The manchego was hard and nutty and delicious. The Chimay Grand Cru made great use of its Belgian beer namesake and was smooth and a bit soft.Would you think I was weird if I said the Hoch Ybrig tasted like a Swiss mountain meadow? Whatever, it totally did - floral and fresh and pastoral. I bet those cows were eating some sweet clover and spring blossoms. Wine, cheese, bread. It's like a guaranteed homerun in my book. One problem - some of the sloooowest food ever. And not in that this-was-grown-within-a-four-block-radius way, either. Just slow. Like fucking molasses. Order-in to food-received: 55 minutes. For three burgers, a macaroni and cheese and a cold turkey sandwich. During a late lunch amongst not more than five other tables. This only makes sense if the kitchen contains a bong. Or maybe a live pig. Don't think about it, though. Just order another cocktail, consume your weight in cheese and, if you want to reenact my own experience, drool a little. As Marie Antoinette would say (OK, probably not, since this is totally unverified and historically questionable, but fuck you for saying so), "Let them each cheese!"Horribly sweaty girl is hungry after Critical Mass.  Cheese on the mind.  Critical Mass ended by going down Central and I had never been to Cheuvront before.  Luckily, I was with Ayesha and it took nothing to convince her to go there.  There were 7 of us and they were extremely quick in pushing table together for us.  They didn't even mind our sweat and water bottles.  The server even filled Ayesha's for her.  I took one look at the menu and my eyes stopped at the bottom: macaroni and cheese.  I rarely eat it, but as soon as I saw it, I wanted.  Badly.  Ayesha said she liked the bleu cheese.  SOLD!  I effing love bleu cheese.  For $8, I think it was a good value.  It was a good portion, but not too much.  Rich and creamy with gargantuan hunks of genuine bleu cheese, that had started to melt.  It was incredibly filling for the size!Downfall: Unisex bathrooms.  What the hell!  I don't care how nice a place is, guys still piss all over the place.The mac and cheese is $5 during the week during happy hour.  I will be back for it, most definitely!Huge points for the server who took Amy in stride when I told him I'd spank his ass for something.  (I don't remember, as it was 109 degrees and I had been on my bike for over 2 hours.)I really want to love Cheuvront. It's close to work and I like the atmosphere here. I also really like the choice of wines they offer and they always have great wine tasting events going on.  I just get the vibe that everyone takes themself WAY too seriously. It's nothing that is blatant because the service is efficient and friendly enough but it's just a feeling that I get, perhaps a slight upturning of the nose or that, the customer should be thankful that they get to be here.I'm always preoccupied with attitude so maybe it's just me but I always have that "am I welcome here?" kind of feeling when I come here. Of course if I'm spending $$ here than the answer is obviously yes....still.....have to have more of a think on this.By all means worth checking out, you'll probably feel a different vibe than me.

As I do whenever I review a sub shop, I must state that I'm from DE, and have high standards for subs.  After trying a battleship sub this weekend, I can say without reservation that the subs here are the best in PGH, without a doubt.  If you haven't tried one, you need to ASAP!Given that I've been wanting to try a battleship for a long while, a friend and I decided to pick one up and have a picnic in nearby Frick Park.  We called in our order, and they gave us an estimate of about 45 min., which worked well given that we had other errands to run.  By the time we arrived at Triangle, our battleship was ready, so we were able to cut in line, pay ($14.75), and be off to have our picnic.Unwrapping the sub, it was immediately apparent that it encompassed 26" of goodness.  Since it wasn't pre-cut, I tore it in half crosswise, which gave each of us 14" to chow down on. The sub was generously filled with meats and cheeses, with a sufficient but not overwhelming amount of vegetables.  The bread was substantial and of good quality, and didn't tear or crumble as we ate our portions of the sub, as lesser quality bread does.  I ate half of my portion, and my friend was unable to finish his, despite intending to do so.  I ate the other half for lunch the next day, and it was almost just as good as it was upon receipt.Both my friend and I were very impressed with the quality of the battleship, and it kept us full for a subsequent long-ish walk in the park.  I'd highly recommend it as an ideal picnic item.  Whether you live near Swissvale or not, be sure to try a battleship, since it's without a doubt the best sub in PGH!

Review Text :
$8 for a well vodka/tonic at Majerle's? Are you serious? I haven't paid that much for a well drink except for fancy resorts and pricey bars in LA or NYC.  That drink and a tall Blue Moon last night came out to a ludicrous $16 before tip. Perhaps this is special highway robbery pricing for unsuspecting NBA All Star visitors?!TVs are awkwardly placed, but the exposed brick lends a time-worn atmosphere to this cozy sports bar.  $16 just isn't worth it though. Too many other bars in the vicinity to waste your time.So I know Abu J. has given me the advice to stop going out with losers, and I have yet to take him up on his advice, but after my latest outing I think I will have to.  I was hanging out at home when I got the call to hang out with this guy for a low key night.  I had to remind him it was Monday Night Football and the NLDS game of Phillies v. Rockies.  So he suggests we hit up Majerle's, which I'm down for because it means more sport watching and less talking.So I find my way down here, and say screw it to paying for parking.  After the whole $20 to park at Westgate, I'm down to take my chances at getting a parking ticket.  It's ridiculous how much the city makes off of parking, parking tickets, and the ever illustrious DUIs.Anyways, I go into Majerle's, completely ignored by the hostess out front.  Glad to know she's getting paid $8.50 to not talk to anyone and act pretty...  Settle down at the bar and order a Blue Moon, because it's a Monday, it's football, it's baseball, and I'm preparing for another laborious date.Halfway through my beer my date arrives.  Which wouldn't be cool, but I need to get good and drunk so I deal.  He automatically decides we need to get wings.  Thanks for deciding...because I have no thoughts of my own.  Apparently him being a gentleman meant he would talk shit on the wings I wanted, then reluctantly give in to getting the boneless buffalo wings.  Which are $5 along with four other appetizers during their 4-8 pm happy hour.  Good deal there!The wings come out within 15 minutes or so and they look...odd.  It looks like someone sliced tofu and lightly fried them, then dipped them in excessive amounts of sauce.  Definitely not the most appetizing item to look at.  I wished they looked better, because then I wouldn't have the hippie making fun of me the whole time.  They tasted okay, but the look alone was too much of a turn off to enjoy.The bartender disappeared after we ordered the wings, so we spent some time waiting for her to discover us again so we could order our entree.  Oh how I wished she had taken our order earlier.  I had to listen to the douche hippie talk smack on the Angels and how people die all the time so Adenhart's death didn't matter.  Yeah...that deserved a total smack in the face.  Or complete beat down.  Don't ever hate of my Angels or commit blasphemy against Adenhart.  I will not stand for that, especially if I've had a few drinks in me.Anyways, so I eventually order the veggie wrap with chicken and he gets the chicken parmesan.  Not too much time passes, so I could enjoy the flat screens and watch the Dolphins show Mark Sanchez how to play a real football game.  The wrap comes, and it's huge!  I enjoyed the fruit salad of pineapple and grapes.  And the actually spinach tortilla and veggies were good, but the chicken just dragged the wrap down.  It was so bland and tasteless.  I wish I would have just gone pure veggie.I had a couple rounds of beer after that, just to pass the time until the Dolphins could be declared the official winners.  Conversation came and went with the people at the bar, far more interesting than the person I was with.  The beers came and went, and soon it was time to peace out.  When I saw the tab, I was glad I didn't have to pay.  $60+ to "enjoy" conversation with a tool and overpriced food and drinks.  Sometimes it's good to be a girl...We stopped in for a bit to eat and some sports watching the other night. My boyfriend had never been before and we are close to down town so it seemed a great idea. Pleased we were! First we got a bomb parking spot right out the front door and it wasn't too crowded so we got a nice table and served quickly. They have happyhour until 7pm, which I love! Most place stop at 6, which sucks since most people cant make it anywhere without driving light speed before 6pm after work. So 7pm cut off for HH is a great find! Pass it on!We ordered the boneless wings to start with half medium sauce and half of their special TD sauce, I recommend both! TD sauce is similar to Zipps Golden sauce if you know what that is like, but better. Then I got the chicken tacos, very good. Enjoyed them greatly! Exactly what I was looking for, hit the spot! Jon got some kinda spicy pasta, which when it hit the table looked amazing, however big prob, they put mushrooms in it, this isn't listed on the menu and Jon is allergic. They took care of it quickly though, remade his selection sans mushrooms and we found out it was as good as it looked. Very nice staff, clean inside, fast service, lots of TVs.... and great happyhour specials!

Review Text :
Nitaya, how do you survive?  When I come by, you're so empty inside that I can always hear the wok frying behind the walls.  At school, the kids pick their teams, and no one ever picks you as their favorite.Honestly, given the competitiveness of Thai restaurants in town and the steep rental prices for property in downtown Champaign, how does Nitaya make it?  The food is not offensively bad, just forgettable.  I've sampled their curries and noodle dishes but nothing invokes the vividly bright, colorful senses that I associate with Thai cooking.  My entrees there are often limp and sad (but maybe I can blame that on the lighting...?).If you want to go on a serious date for Thai food, Nitaya Thai could serve as an appropriate setting.  The interior decor is immediately recognizable as an oh-so-camp, tropical-themed '80s bar, with wicker chairs and faded turquoise booths.  There's something undeniably charming about the setup, but unfortunately it lacks the warmth that only a crowded dining room can offer.

I wanted sushi and was willing to drive my friends to PV for Yasu Sushi Bistro (highly recommended by me!) but they were too tired and wanted something within a block or two of the Hyatt. They asked the concierge, who recommended this place as very good! Has she ever had good Mexican food, or is she getting kickbacks?The Matador Restaurant is across from the Hyatt Hotel, in the center of downtown. It has been in business since 1976, is large, and IMO, "Bleh".It is owned by a Greek Family for one. All 32 years. All the Mexican dishes and specialites were mostly from one of their first cooks. Great, make your cook create all the recipes for authentic dishes and you make all the money. There is even a small Greek section of the menu which offers low end Greek dishes (Gyros Sandwich, Gyros Plate, Greek salad, Feta Cheese plate, and something called Shrimp a-la Mike!)The menu has print so small, only a search light and magnifying glass can decipher it. They do have some authentic dishes, like menudo, carnitas, lengua con chile verde; and the basics like enchiladas, tacos, tamales, tostadas, chimichangas, carne asada, chalupas, fajitas and flautas. They bring you chips and two types of salsa. We ordered (extra) guacamole, and it didn't taste or look very fresh, like they mixed a jar of paste with a couple of avacadoes. The Margaritas were uninspired and weak. I tried the Machacas (sauteed shredded beef) which was moist but lacked flavor, and was supposed to be with green chilis, tomatos, and onions with rice and beans for $10.95). 3 others in my group were unimpressed with the food, and they were French Canadien (So what do they know about Mexican food, except when it isn't good!).They also have steaks and chicken dishes, but why bother? The food was passable but would not entice you to come again, unless you got drunk at a ball game at the local Chase Field stadium and were starving.OMG NOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!like Grand Master Flash said about the white lines "Don't Do It"Rang dang diggedy dang di-dang Diggedy dang di-dang diggedy dang di-dangmy Torta Burro had no flava-dang, i was sad panda mangthis business has been in operation too long and clearly the owners (i doubt the original owners) stopped giving a shit. if they did the average rating wouldn't be 2.5 stars. i remember this place as a kid, i don't remember ever eating here. so i really cannot comment on how great it was. but like Sing High, the downtown nostalgia restaurants are extremely scary. just avoid this...it's not good. my plate looked sad, just a naked burro with a side of hashbrowns that were hardly crispy anywhere. the salsa was tasty, but i would hardly add a star to it. the service was compitant, but i couldn't understand her. i couldn't blame my ADD on it. my friend liked the menudo, but i wouldn't make that a saving grace for this place. cool logo on the building. very retro..but do not be fooled by it.

Review Text :
Though this place truly looks like a dive, I had high expectations - for the food, at least - because of a glowing review I read in one of the local journals. The place looks a tad decrepit and while the tables look clean, their surfaces did have a bit of a sticky feel to them. On one occasion I had the huaracha recommended by the review I read. It was a generous portion of food and it tasted good, though it was a bit on the dry side. On a second visit, this time with my friend Rand R., I ordered a variety of street tacos - al pastor, carne asada, carnitas, and chorizo. They were very good, especially when you add the salsa offered on the side. The horchata I ordered with the tacos was good and was the perfect  accompaniment fo the tacos. In all, my dining experiences here were A-OK, though I'd rather go to Tacos Atoyac for similarly-priced  but higher-quality food ... and tables with a cleaner feel.

Urp.  Mmm, sweet peppers.When you decide to become a vegetarian, you realize that there are some sacrifices you are going to have to make in the food department. When I became veg, veggie burgers were made by mixing this powder with water and frying it in a pan. It was horrible. I pretty much ate grilled cheese for the first year. Now, fifteen years later, Capriotti's...  Holy Shit!!! VEGGIE TURKEY SUB. Tears of joy are streaming down my face at THIS very moment. It's like losing your virginity all over again, but this time its good! Real good!For $7.75 I have the hugest, most delicious sub I have ever eaten in my life. Such good quality ingredients, and this medium is HUGE!They also have New York Kettle Style Chips, which are delish, but you definitely don't need them when you have 12" of veggie turkey sub staring you down.My life seriously just changed.An indulgent deli, and I mean that in the best of ways.  Subway healthy this is not- and that is ok.  I come here if I want a good old fashioned splurge type of deli sandwich.  I ordered the 20 inch (!) Capastrami. Lots of salt on the pastrami,  full on mayo based  cole slaw, and no wheat rolls here.  Hits the spot.  Staff friendly, sandwich made in less than five minutes.

Review Text :
OMFG!!!!!!!!!!!  I went here for lunch today and they had lobster tail tacos.  I come to this location about once a month.  It's incredibly clean and the service is always friendly.  I like to see confusion on peoples' faces when I break out my Spanish and place my order.  The lobster tail tacos were A M A Z I N G!!!!!!!!!  Big hunks of lobster tail (langostino) and a pinkish sauce served in huge corn tortillas.  I got the combo, which comes with a side of rice and a side of beans.  You can choose refried or black.  I love their black beans.Another thing I love about Baja Fresh is their salsa bar.  My favorite is the baja.  It's a smoky chipotle salsa.  I always get a bunch of different salsas to take home with me.  Their green salsa changed, but it's still really good and tastes so fresh.There are NO microwaves here.  I have a "thing" about microwaves and rarely use mine at home.  I think it's strange to heat up food without something...hot.  *shudder*Anyway, it's a clean facility with fresh food and many different options.  I'm still thinking about my langostino tacos, even if this is a chain.Baja fresh is pretty freakin fresh.I love their "no freezer, no MSG, no preservatives, no nuthin crappy" vibe, which they reinforce with signage plastered around the restaurant.The food is delish. Lots of good options for meat-eaters & veggie-heads. They do it right with a delicious salsa bar that containis at least 5 different salsas, fresh limes and they've got a good selection of iced teas.
Rokerij=Rok is probably one of the dopest joints in phoenix. If your trying to get a girl or guy to make out with you, I  highly suggest going to the down stairs bar and parking near the fire place. The service is awesome, every time I go the bartenders remembers my name, (I love that shit) the music is amazing one minute radiohead the next mgmt, really great stuff. The food is a bit pricey but you get a salad with most meals which is a rare thing these days. So overall Rok is a great spot to impress someone you want to make out with.Tonight, I had a chance to show a brutha some culture.  When someone is taking me to dinner, I pick a place that I *know* is going to be a winner.  Rokerij didn't disappoint!  The parking lot was full, so I started to get scared that we wouldn't be able to get a table or have to *gasp* wait for one.At first, we had gone downstairs to eat there, but it was packed, so we headed to the restaurant.  From previous reviews, I was afraid it would be packed and we would have to find somewhere else to go eat.  I really wanted to impress the guy (HA even though he was buying!) and, luckily, there were a few empty tables upstairs.We were seated at the far end in a corner booth.  Any restaurants with booths get an A+ in my book.  I love sitting close to friends and a booth gives the perfect opportunity.Specials were neatly written on blackboards, but I was at a weird angle to read them.  Chris, our waiter, read them for us and explained each dish.  That was the high point of his service the rest of the night.As we perused the menu, our drink order was taken.  I really wanted to get the small plates and try a few different things, so we both chose 3 each.  I got the crab tostadas.  They were filled to the brim with crab, not too much dressing so the crab flavor wasn't drowned.  I also got the bacon-wrapped grilled shrimp (YUMMY!!!!) and the brie toasts.  Divine!  The cheese was melted perfectly, with just enough of its grease to soak into the bread.  I actually licked my fingers after each one.He got the skewered steak, shrimp on dirty rice and meat tacos.  The rice wasn't all that, but the rest of the dishes were superb!As we ate, and our drinks emptied, we had to call Chris over to get refills.  Not once had he checked on us during the meal.  It's the reason for 4 stars!  I was a bit disappointed in that.  For such a Valley favorite, I had hoped for a little more attention.Ambiance is key at Rokerij.  The smell of the wood-burning fireplace, the cozy booth and warm atmosphere gave me cause to want to go back again.  And, the brutha liked, it too!Knocking a star off for you Rokerij. Believe me, this hurts me more than it hurts you. I visited last Sunday and our service was friendly, but it didn't make up for the poor delivery of food and the problem with solving issues that we had. I have only had the small plates from Rokerij. This trip I decided to try some of their "New Mexican" offerings.  My appetizer order, which was specifically stated to be an appetizer, not an entree came with my entree. Considering the appetizer did not even have to be cooked (steak tartare), that's unacceptable. When I commented on it I got a "Ugh, I know, right?" Um...really? My entree which was the Rokerij sampler was meh. The best part of the dish was the benedict. The enchiladas were bland and plain old mush.  I had dinner with my best friend Amber, and my good friend Ayesha. Ayesha had me sample her enchiladas as she has specifically asked that she not be served pork. I bit into a bite of pork enchilada off of Ayesha's plate. When the waiter was flagged down, he said "Hm, not sure what to do about this." Really?? Luckily, before I went off like a powder keg, he offered to remake them. He didn't comp anything for the obvious mistakes that were made. I hope he realized that there were some boo-boos made when he saw his tip was so small. I hope to give back the star I just took away, but they're going to have to wow me to do that. It's too bad that this trip was so disappointing.We went on a double date the other night to Rokerij.  Funny I'd been wanting to go to Rokerij for a while now, and when we finally pulled up, I realized that I had been before!  (I guess I'm getting old or something and really losing it... I actually had been there once before when I first moved to AZ, not realizing what the name of the place was).I called to make a reservation a few days before the date and was told they could accommodate our group at upstairs, but not down unless we wanted to wait until 9:00.  Alright then... 7:00 upstairs worked!We were celebrating our engagement and our friends' being pregnant, and we had the perfect booth; kind of a half circle shape.  Lindsay was our waitress and took good care of us.  The atmosphere is dark but warm and cozy... perfect to walk into on a cold night!We decided to start with a few of the small plates to start... (both guys in our group are big eaters). They let me choose one of them and I chose the stuffed mushrooms - they are stuffed with crab meat and were delicious.  They also chose the spareribs (which I tasted and were quite tasty) and the bacon wrapped scallops.  For entrees, Jared and I took advantage of the $36 special which included our choice of meet, 2 salads, and 2 side items.  I chose the entrecote and probably would not choose that again.  It's a bone-in ribeye and was way too fatty... we enjoyed our spinach and Rokerij salads and our sides of broccoli and asparagus.  I probably could've just had the small plates and salad and been just fine.  We took home leftover meat for Minnie, so she was a happy dog that night!Instead of ordering dessert, we walked next-door to DQ - can't go wrong with that!Overall, I'd say our experience was 3.5 but I'll round up for now because Lindsay was a great waitress and we had fun with our friends.  I'll overlook the fact that one of the bussers spilled steak juice on me when delivering our entree... I won't rush back but I'll keep Rokerij in mind for future gatherings with small groups.Sadly, I am forced to agree with Leslie M who wrote on 4/10. This was one of my favorite places to visit, to introduce newcomers to, treat family and friends, and for a time I'd visit once every two months or so. My previous three visits have not gone so well; I'll relate my latest visit which took place just over a week ago. A friend attempted to make reservations for two on a Thursday. He was told that due to a policy change by  Richardson, a reservation for two on a Thursday could no longer be taken, as there was disappointment that their business for tables of 4 or more were suffering. Okay, I can understand, business decisions have to be made, but cut your nose off to spite your face? However, the woman that answered the phone let us know there should be no problem getting a table. I was seated shortly before my friend arrived so I had a chance to look over the menu. To my surprise, some changes have been made. First, a salad choice (and they're all very typically very yummy), anyway, a choice is no longer offered. Instead, the house salad is offered at $4 with the entree purchase. Next, a statement is now printed across the top of the menu letting the patron know "you order it, you bought it"...is this REALLY necessary? While the server and busboy were friendly and helpful (my water glass was never empty), my $4 house salad arrived about 90 seconds before our entrees did. Oh, the accompanying bread was hard as stone and arrived with my salad, while an attentive server should have brought it along just after our drinks were served, as my dinner partner hadn't ordered a salad. Oh, my friend, he's typically a big fan of the Steak Rokerij, and absolutely loves the crab/hollandaise sauce mixture. As normal, he asked for more sauce. On this visit, we found $10 added to the check for that request. We found that unusual for Rokerij. Things have certainly changed. I was willing to overlook these changes, after all, the economy is poor these days. I excused myself to use the men's room. After all, we did have Chimay (Rokerij has never had a wide beer selection). I found the towel basket to be so PACKED with paper-towels, I couldn't get one out of the basket, which is on a vanity so small, when you turn the water on, the towels become soaked. This explains the stained, linen towel basket liner...the stains were grays and greens. Overall, I feel that these things add up to failing to pay attention to detail. It's a shame really. I really hope the best for Richardson and hope Rokerij can return to it's former self.This place is sexy...... woh.This is a review of the downstairs loungey sexy area, not the regular dining area. Is there a regular dining area? huh... don't remember seeing it.Anyway, the "small plates" menu is divine like jesus. I'm not kidding. The Beef Tenderloin Toasts were as much of a religious experience as I'll allow myself to have. The Ahi Tuna with wasabi salsa *blush* caused me to mush mouth the words "ohhhh muhhh gawww" while I was still chewing my food. I don't do that. Ever. It's just nasty. The Blue Crab Tostadas were light and refreshing, the perfect compliment to the rich tenderloin. The wine... let's just say I like me some wine. The only complaint I have is that the bartender needed a trim. Seriously... his hipster do was getting in his line of vision and anytime we needed anything I had to flash him to get his attention. Okay, not really but you get the point. In closing: This place will make you forget what you were fighting about. Trust me on that. :)The endDear reader.... Before you decide if this place is great... think about what else you consider great.  When you were 17 and you took a date to Olive Garden, okay, you get a pass.  BUT, if you ever ever ever went on a date to Outback, or Red Lobster... just stop right now.  You will think this place is just amaaaaazing.  So come out, enjoy their food and on the way home jump out into traffic. (Please do that behind me, so as not to make me late to work.)Okay, that said... This place struggles from an identity crisis.  Rokerij, who are you appealing to?  The fools that think that this is a classy joint because their previous best date was to Applebees?  OR are you a really good place?  This place should not have a $12 chicken sandwich with fries on the same menu as a $43 steak.  Choose one direction and stick with it.  I called up at 6pm on a Saturday, first available reservation was for 9pm.  This is a good sign.  I take the reservation and then went for a hair cut at Urban Hair... see my other review, they rule.We get to Rokerij at 830ish.  I walk in the door, and apologize to the staff who are clearly at a waiter station.  We must have walked in the side door.  Whoops!   No, thats the front.  Wait, what?  A friggin computer screen and some silverware, thats the front?  No no, it cant be... oh yes.  Yes, this is phoenix.  Yes, this is the front.  Okay, okay... im cool... whatever.  We will be downtstairs having a drink.The bar downstairs is okay.  Some 50 yr old dude trying to flirt with a 20something girl.   Standard.   We have martinis.  Not bad, the bartender made it okay.  Chopin vodka.  He didnt really know what to do with the vermouth, but it was okay.  I chat with my friend, we are sitting on a couch, its pretty fun so far.  A server comes down and says, "your table is ready"  Cool.  We stand up.  She goes over and starts talking to the 50yr old male cougar and his little cub.  We wait.... finally i walk over to her.  AH HEM... should we just go upstairs?  She turns  "yep, i said it was ready."  Oooooh no.  You had better walk my ass right up to my table.  Nope, i can already tell the service is going to be abysmal.  We walk upstairs.  We wait there for almost 5 min.  Then i grab a bus boy and in broken espanol, i ask him... neccecitamos una mesa... ya dig?  He starts wiping down a table.  I ask my date... why the hell do we have reservations again?  Then as we are being seated, a hostess girl says, "oh your table is over here"  WELLL princess, thanks so much for telling me that 10 min ago....  and we sit. The waitress comes over and says "what can i get ya?"  Excuse me Maude... what is this a diner?  Can i get a slice a pie and a glass of manners?  I ask her what her name is... i then introduce myself and start to read some of the specials off of the wall.  She gets the hint.  I hate my decision to come here.  We order more martinis... Vodka might make this better. We order some specials... i get meat, lots of it.  The food is very good, though pricey.  Im still annoyed that there is a $10 cheeseburger on the menu.  Dont get me wrong, i love a PBR and a Burger... just not what i was expecting after all of the reviews i read.  When the time comes to order dessert, i think to myself... seriously, lets just stop at starbucks.  We get our check.  The bottom line.  This place has good food, but is not a fancy joint.  If people said, its a decent bar with good food, i would say: "heck yes, 4 stars, just needs some better service."  But they think they are classy, and so does yelp... its not.  Frankly, It shouldnt have anything on the menu over $27.  The service is friggin dreadful.  A half drunk toddler could manage this place better.   That is all...Poo poo on all the naysayers. Rokerij is bad ass, which is why it is always wicked crowded. The ambiance is a teeny bit cowboy, some rustic Flagstaff, some Old-world European, and ALL sexy - grotto staircase leading to dim and plush with roaring fireplaces scattered about. The menu is diverse - plenty of funk and weirdness for the more adventuresome, but some more traditional favorites for your conservative friends. All I care about is that they still make me my beloved veggie quesadillas, bursting with roasted broccolini and corn and filled with just the right amount of cheese, served on a wooden cutting board with two kinds of fresh, flavorful, and just-enough-spicy salsa. It's so good, it keeps me from trying the small plates, which sound scrumptious.I'm not sure where all the bitching and moaning about the service come from. Our last visit here was on a packed and swinging Saturday night where we had to wait an hour for a table. Our server was prompt, attentive, and competent, although some odd comments ("What a good looking table! Are you brother and sister?") left us scratching our heads. The crowd is entertaining as well, although I don't think you'd find me scrounging around for a date. Lots of cougars and cougars-in-training with flashy jewelry and spray on tans. Despite this potentially stiff crowd, the place was lively and everyone seemed to be having a perfectly good time. The crowd may overlap somewhat with the 40th St/Campbell BMW- and Range Rover-driving MILF yuppie sect, but somehow it all seems a lot less pretentious here. The word is that the neighboring DQ is going to be torn down to make room for the rebirthed Richardson's. Woo! Between Rokerij and Richardson's, this corner is going to rival 40th St & Campbell. I can't wait!Things I learned last night:I love unpretentious yet quality service, in a relaxed atmosphere. (she was awesome)I don't like drinking ice water without a straw...yeah yeah, turn your nose up. (work on that) You can split a bottle of wine between 5 people. (please don't ever make me do that again)I have a new crush. (restaurants without windows)Rokerij is fast becoming a new favorite spot of mine. I went out on a limb and ordered the NY Steak, medium rare. It was fantastic. Not a huge fan of the green chilie twice baked potato thing but that's more of a personal taste issue. We all shared the Bacon Wrapped Shrimp and Calamari as appetizers. Both delicious; the sauce served with the Calamari tastes distinctively like Pei-Wei's sweet and sour, though that's not a bad thing. Desert was "Death by Chocolate". I had one bite. One bite was enough. Heavy and rich like fudge...not my thing.All in all a great dining experience. I will be back. Many....many times. They also happen to serve the full Richardson's menu, just the way I remember it. That made the whole table happy although the following is what seals the deal for me:* Sorry we do not provide high chairs or booster seats *yes, it's love.... without the constant arguing :)Rokerij is no Jokerij!Not much new can be written about this amazing spot, so I will try and be brief. Went to the basement bar for Friday happy hour, and it was love at first sight. Cozy, dark, and welcoming- this is a place you can get lost in.Grabbed a seat at the bar, and were warmly greeted. Ordered margaritas and some small plates, they were both outstanding. Tried numerous small plates, and each one was delicious and hit the spot.If you like margaritas, you will be a happy camper. Also try the stuffed mushrooms, they are amazing.After leaving my new favorite place, we went to the Taste of Scottsdale, and it was surprising that none of the food there was HALF as good as what Rokerij provided. After a few samples, my group gave up, as it wasn't fair to our stomachs to put average food with amazing Rokerij food. All in all, not a bad problem to have.The bf and I wanted Dick's Hideaway for breakfast, and were not particular about which location we ate off the menu from. For some reason. we just didn't feel like being cramped in the location next to Luci's today.Very glad we tried the Rokerij! It was not busy for breakfast, so we got a giant comfy booth to ourselves. It was nice and dark inside which we like! The service was fine. We had Ryno today, and he was outgoing, spoke about a few menu items, and generally came back in a reasonable amount of time. I decided to try something different, and got the dungeness crab omelet featured on the blackboard. It was a generous amount of crab, peppers and onions, paired with the standard tortilla, potatoes and beans.  Not something I'd order on a regular basis, but this whole place is a bit of an adventure and the crab omelet really hit the spot.He got the meatloaf and eggs, mmm spicy!! You have to ask for ketchup for your potatoes, and we were only brought one ramekin, but that's okay. It sufficed.We don't really care for free valet as we are fully capable of parking our own car, but at least when we walked out, they brought our car immediately.Overall, not enough for the 5th star, but it's worth the drive for something different. We are dying to come back for lunch sometime and try that Pasta Heidi or Chimayo Chicken! I could find the back door and restrooms here, too. The ladies' room was clean with interesting artwork on the wall. This is silly, but I loved that they had the nice soft paper towels. Maybe that's why the menu prices are so high lol.4 1/2 stars actually...I really enjoyed Rokerij. Our server David was fantastic, and even though we were seated at the bar for dinner, the level of attentiveness was super. Knowing that we had never eaten at Rokerij, David took the time to explain the menu in detail and made recommendations.Rokerij has quite the wine and beer list, however I opted for one of the specialty cocktails listed on the board. It was a double berry martini. I guess I was thinking double berry meant double the berries but it actually meant double vodka (I am a rookie, what can I say?)and was far too strong for a girl who likes her alcohol embedded in a concoction that tastes yummy. David must have seen I was struggling to drink this so he very kindly got a tall glass with ice and added some lemonade and then poured my "vodka surprise" on in. Yay! It was much more suitable and I was able to enjoy. :)I ordered a sirloin steak with roasted corn and their signature potato baked into a green chile. The potato was cold but it tasted good and definitely had a kick. My friend ordered the enchiladas (one steak, one chicken, one shrimp) and loved their dish.I would definitely go back and try out some of their other dishes, There was so much that looked and sounded good. Sitting at the bar, we could see the food being prepared and everything that came out looked delicious. The portions are very generous at Rokerij. We will be back soon!JD invades AZ Day 1:Rokerij (pronounced Ro-k-ray and is the Dutch Word for Smokehouse (which raises a whole slew of questions that I won't get into) is listed as one of "Arizona's 50 Best Restaurants" by one of the local food bloggers (Ricky Lee Potts). It also came highly recommended by my Dad, and knowing how picky he is, I knew I had to check this place out. Appetizers/Small Plates:Bacon-Wrapped Scallops- I saw this as one of the review highlights and knew I had to have it. The BWS were huge, cooked perfectly and they are served with four amazing sauces that are the Chef's choice for the night. On this night they were 2 kinds of Green Salsa, Red Salsa and a Hollandaise sauce. My clear favorites were the Hollandaise and the Red Salsa but they were all good. 5*Pan-Seared Salmon- Small bite-sized pieces of Salmon with a Chipotle-Mayo. The Salmon itself could've used some seasoning but the Chipotle-Mayo was excellent. 4*Santa Fe Trail:Carne Adovada- Smoked Pork shoulder that's simmered in a Red Chile sauce and served with Rice and Beans. The Rice and Beans were pretty standard, but the Pork itself was excellent. It literally seemed to get better and better as the meal went on but it also got progressively hotter and hotter as the meal went on; I was sweating like Britney Spears on Jeopardy by the time I was done eating. 4.5*Chile Potato- Apparently this is one of the dishes that Rokerij is famous for. It's a fire-roasted green Hatch Chile that's stuffed with a mashed potato mixture. I'm not sure if I had it on an off-night, or what, but it just didn't do it for me. I mean everything was there for a stupendous dish but there just wasn't any flavor. I had my sis and Bro-in-law try some just to verify it wasn't me and they agreed it was a fail. 2*Beverages- Rokerij has a really impressive wine selection -which I'm not really into- and a mediocre beer selection; I was not impressed with their draft selection. They also have an über-cool underground (literally and figuratively!) bar that is separate from the restaurant itself; I can imagine the shenanigans that ensue there! 4*Service & Ambiance- Our waitress was very friendly and extremely knowledgeable about the menu because my sister always has questions (Oy gevalt...) and she answered them all quickly and to her satisfaction. Rokerij is very dark; has a nice wood and brick interior; and even has a fireplace going at all times--which is kinda odd seeing that it's in Arizona. The ambiance is definitely set for a date night kinda mood: very romantic and sexy--not the place you wanna bring a precocious 3-year-old (Whoops!). 4.75*Value- Pretty good value for a really nice place like this. I'd say the avg entrée runs anywhere from $15-30; which is pretty good for high quality food. 4*If you're looking for a great restaurant to impress a special someone; a place to celebrate a special event; or even something as casual as a date night then this is the place for you. I wouldn't recommend bringing kids with you as it's just not a kid friendly place and that's ok, too. You don't have to take the little monsters everywhere.This a one of my boss's favorite places to take special guest. Located in the same parking lot right next to the new Richardson's. There is a really cool patio that connects the two restaurants with an outdoor Bar. Instantly puts you in the party zone and makes you feel right at home.This is the first time my wife and I have been to the Rokerij and it was truly a fun and happy experience. Been to Dick's Hideaway and the older Richardsons many times in the past. The selection on the menu here has several of the same tasty good SW options with some really nice EuroAmerican surprises.Love the way you can instantly smell the aroma of the Pecan wood coming from the sizzling grill. Pecan gives the food some very nice flavor and that extra kick. Everything here and his other restaurants always taste great and leave you satisfied.Upstairs and downstairs are both the Rokerij now. Upstairs is quite a bit larger with a nice bar and a larger seating area. Downstairs has a top secret elevator or you can take the stairs. It is smaller and offers food and drinks as well. Could even be a nifty bomb shelter in a parallel universe.We started off with some Prime Rib Sliders and Bacon Wrapped Shrimp. My boss and his lovely wife ordered the New Mexican Platter and the Salt and Pepper Encrusted Prime Rib. My wife order the awesome Chimayo Chicken and yours truly went with the tasty Grilled Swordfish Special. Chocolate Flan with a 1/2 shot of Grand Marnier completed the trifecta.Really love the way they layer the flavors. The atmosphere of this place and friendly servers are also a delight. We arrived early and were able to get a large table by their cozy rustic fireplace.Place gets really busy quick. Try and go before the crowd and you will enjoy everything that much more. When we were leaving it was starting to get crazy. DRINKS ON ME EVERYONE!5 STARSWhen pressed for that *one* place to visit in Phoenix, there is only Rokerij. Somehow - magically - the space is designed to feel intimate. Cozy. But the space meanders around. (The booths have room to seat parties of four to six, depending on the side of the fireplace you're gazing at.)Dates would be impressed. As would a business partner or your girlfriends. The hushed tones of the dark room encourage whispered conversation. The food and wine has always been impeccably delivered. The Oysters - just stop. Whatever you're doing can wait. Go. I promise you, your palate will enjoy the menu. I have a few photos up of sliders, scallops wrapped in bacon and artichoke dip. But that is an injustice. Rokerij offers a robust menu.Happy hour is quite generous. If you're not sure pay attention: Happy hour is *every day* until 6pm. (Reverse HH is 10pm to midnight.) Alas, the true secrets of happy hour are best revealed by calling in. They change often and may not make it to Facebook or their website in time. Visit often and you'll know the inside scoop!Currently... Wonderful, hearty glasses of wine are poured for 1/2 the normal price. All appetizers are $2-3 off a plate. But you *must* sit at the bar.The bartenders are well versed in their product knowledge. The table staff are stunning. Visiting here is like visiting dear, close friends. Special note: The space is ADA accessible. Parking is valet. Thanks Rokerij!Finally decided to check this out recently. Great atmosphere, great food, and great drinks. I'm not sure what can be said that is not found in other reviews, but Rokerij is very good. It's a grill, so vegetarians might not find it too their liking, but others will enjoy their evening. If you're looking for a nice place to eat or drink, check it out.
Cafe Sam=This was my second time at Cafe Sam and both times I dined here because it was arranged through my job.  The first time I dined here, I was looking forward to it, because everyone whom I've ever heard talk about this place raved about it, yet I left wondering if everyone who has raved about it just has really bad taste in restaurants and their definition of "good" food.So, on my second visit I inwardly cringed as my 2 companions raved about the place and teased the waitress about the list of specials which is absolutely ridiculous however it does seem as though the restaurant has pared down their enormous menu and specials menu from the only other time that I was there (I remember it taking our waitress at least 5 minutes to ramble off the specials on the previous visit while on this particular visit it seemed to take half the time.  I ordered the linguine with shrimp scampi which I asked to add spinach but was told that it already had spinach (the menu is so large that it would be impossible for them to list the ingredients in each dish) - so while someone may think, "oh, it's great that they have a large menu," the truth of the matter is that they don't seem to be able to therefore do anything well - it's all rather extremely mediocre at best to nearly inedible.  My companions enjoyed their meals however, and they ordered the linguine with salmon and the smoked hot dog special covered in some sort of  BBQ type of sauce.  My pasta was bland - I never add salt when I go out to eat and I had to add salt but even adding salt and some pepper really did nothing to give the dish flavor.  I left the restaurant dissatisfied and hungry for a good plate of pasta, which I rarely eat by the way, and it actually had me thinking about how much better the Olive Garden's pasta is compared to Cafe Sam.  I'm just completely baffled about the popularity of this restaurant though as some others who have given the restaurant the fair 1-3 star reviews have already mentioned, this is a haven for senior citizens and from the other Yelp reviews for out of town guests who maybe don't know what good food really is.  With all of the other options available nearby in Shadyside and in Bloomfield this is the last place that I would go next to the other Baum Blvd. debacle, Ritter's Diner.  I don't know why or how folks flock to either restaurant nor how they rave about either establishment other than to say that both places must hold some nostalgic value that makes people overlook the bad food.
Yusef's Middle Eastern Restaurant Grocery & Deli=Yusef's is my old standby place when I crave middle eastern food, Lebanese style.  The Gyros are excellent, right down to the pickle and the sweet onion... mmmmm.  The portions are generous, and everything is always well prepared.  They serve a hummus dis that I really like... it has beef and pine nuts.  The baklavah is good.  They usually have several different varieties.The place has always been run by really nice people, but the new owners are the nicest people yet.About a month ago, I was on the way home from visiting my cousin in the hospital when my growling stomach let me know that no food for 12 hours was not making it happy....  I ran into the store at 6:45 pm.  They close at 7.The owners were at the front counter.... "You're hungry," said the woman looking at me with concern"yes," I nodded  "Can I get a Gyro, or is it too late."She looked at her husband... "she's hungry," she said to him... He hesitated."She's hungry!" the wife repeated...I knew they had probably cleaned up already and were getting a sandwich even though it was inconvenient.  I was so grateful.  It was the best Gyro I have EVER had...  I stop there about once a week now, on my way home from the hospital.  I get a few groceries and something for dinner. I always get there by 6:15 though.My friend was in the Service and had a craving for some Middle Eastern food so I pulled up Yelp and this seemed to be the closest in my area. I have driven by this place a gajillion times in the last 13 yrs or so and thanks to Yelper's I have learned that not everything is what it seems looks wise. It was 6:30 this Saturday we barely made it in time. It was clean I was happy to sit down inside and get out of the cold.The server was pretty polite. The food took a little while but it was worth it. I had the Veggie Platter they were out of something they substituted with rice bit it was all good. Great humus and falafel yummmm I want more now lol I love love grape leaves and cant get enough now I know where to go to get my fix! The lentil soup was awesome and served steaming hot in this weather totally hit the spot with fresh pita bread. This was plenty of food perfect for sharing and I'm not even sure I'd ever order that plate for $12.99 on my own. My friend had the lamb kabob and some soup as well and no complaints here either. They have hookah's and the good shisha my friend grabbed us some mint flavor which he love's I'm pretty sure its not any cheaper here than say a smoke shop. I saw a sign that said they have whole lambs and they had tons of stuff like gallon Tahini tubs and cute little tea sets among all the food stuff that looked good too. All in all I will be back to try some more delicous eats!falafel phoenix best falafel best phoenix best falafel phoenix best phoenix falafel phoenix falafel best phoenix best falafel6 Star Falafel !    IT'S GREEN!Seriously the best in the valley, perhaps anywhere.  AND IT'S GREEN!It really does look like some hippies may have cooked up a batch of "Magic Falafel" in the back of their VW camper bus in the Shakedown Street parking lot of a Dead concert.  I'm sure it's more benign spices making these garbanzo flour patties the color of money, grass, and a soccer player's ass, but they are a mos def a HOMEMADE recipe.  I'm not saying all light brown falafel is from a box, but that's what most gyro places are doing.       8^ P`.',.`    ---pPbblltptllptbtI can do box all by myself.Various kebobs, dolmas, greek and tabouli salads, pita sandwiches -- the menu is classic greek fast food deli style, which just like the strip mall pad they occupy, the menu is a bit smaller than it used to be. They've changed ownership and also pared down the size of their store significantly since their heyday.  Yusef's was Best of Phoenix by New Times, or AZ Republic, or Get Out, etc, quite a bit circa 90, 92, 93, 95, 96, 2001 if I remember the signage.  Since then, things have gotten tough in the American economy for a niche market of Middle Eastern folks.  I sure hope they didn't suffer from former customers purposefully avoiding them after 2001 for any sort of discriminatory reasons -- what a shame that would be!Perusing the aisles of the grocery while waiting for your food to be prepared is like being flashed to an indoor version of an exotic marketplace bazaar (like in the first Indiana Jones movie, or hey, like Shakedown Street) full of strange and enticing shapes and smells and textures, foreign languages, and lots of "What the heck is THIS!?".  Spice grinders!  Pomegranate juice! Curry powder! Turkish coffee pots!  Anchovie fillets! Fresh Olives! Tamarind extract!I'm ready for the PARTY!  Where's the Houkka?  THERE IT IS! Up on the wall, several to choose from actually.My green falafel sandwich was freshly made, hot, and delicious.Still the best falafel in the Phoenix area (but sadly, it was found to be "Magic" only in it's tasty savory goodness).   Only $5.99 with a soda, or check with the owner on bartering your knit sweater-making skills.Can anyone recommend a good Goo Ball vendor for dessert?
Salsas Y Sombreros=omg amazing place! definately try a green-sauce enchilada with cheese, the rice and beans are amazing and salsa reminds me of the authentic places in San Diego...tiny hole in the wall though, so keep an eye out for it...if you exit the 1-10 at 32nd, head south about two blocks, make a left (east) on broadway, its right after 36th street in an industrial area....if you see Napa Auto parts across the way, you found it! :-) they will literally make you ANYTHING you want (within reasonable terms of course!) and they have a good kids menu for the little ones
Bado's Pizza Grill And Ale House=Bado's is a quintessential Pittsburgh pizza stop. I may even consider it the best pizza in Pittsburgh! I hadn't been in since 2008 or so which was pre-food allergies for me. My friends got pizza and said it was the best they had had in a long, long time. I really don't think you can go wrong with any of the toppings.If you've read some of my other reviews, you know I have 14 food allergies. This makes it almost impossible to dine anywhere, but when a restaurant feeds me with ease, I am a happy camper! They accommodated me with no problem and I had a delicious grilled chicken salad! I was very impressed.My mom was not too keen on her bruschetta wedge salad, mainly because of the dressing (which is homemade, however I do love their homemade greek dressing!). She still managed to devour most of it, though!The staff could have been a little friendlier, but they made a meal happen for me, so no complaints!
Pizza Heaven Bistro=When I get excited, I squeal like the little child that I am. Another childlike quality I posses is the overwhelming love and affection for pizza, so you can only imagine the complete and utter detestation that I felt when I learned I had food allergies to gluten, eggs, and dairy. My poor little baby heart just broke. That is, until I learned that Pizza Heaven, appropriately named, was placed on this planet, in this very city, right down the road from my home, just for people like me. Gluten Free Dough. Vegan Cheese. Abundant Toppings. Yeah - I squealed. I ate the shit out of that pizza. I even loved it on day two. And day three. And if Pizza Heaven doesn't watch out, I'm going to be back again every night for the next week. The place is uber cute. The staff is friendly. The location is great. The parking is accommodating. They have "regular" food (pizza, subs, pasta, etc). And they serve booze. Thank you for catering to us pain-in-the-ass children that were put on the planet to make everyone's life difficult!My last review was hard to swallow, it wasn't something that I particularly liked doing. Having said that, I am proud to say I can't possibly give Pizza Heaven anything less then 5 stars now. This is why:Two days after posting my last review, I was contacted through Yelp by the owner. She had even found my phone number and email address and contacted me there as well, after I didn't respond promptly she tried me again......it was evident she wanted to make things right and talk about my experience at Pizza Heaven. Over the next two weeks we discussed the issue and she apologized more then once and explained what had happened. We talked a bit about the compromises and challenges to running your own business and I found out all about where she sourced her Vegan cheese from, how to order other items Vegan at the restaurant, and about a new vegan sausage she was trying. Suffice to say that the owner cares immensely about her business and her customers. If all owners cared this much we might have a real dining dilemma (does Yelp exist in a society if every place warrants 5 stars??).I am happy to say that the owner made things right to my satisfaction (and then some) and I am also eager to let veg heads know about the new Vegan sausage - its pretty damn good. I have gotten two pies since my last review (sausage and green pepper) and they have been much better.I am glad that Pizza Heaven is now back on my pizza rotation. I am even more thrilled that we have owners like we have at Pizza Heaven here in Phoenix.I have been to this place many times now over the years. Surprised it has taken me so long to review it. Maybe, I thought I had.Anyway. Great location. It used to be more south. It was a cool little hole in the wall back then. Now it is more like a cool little family restaurant. They play live music even on certain days.THe food is good, the atmosphere is not too bad.It is a nice place to go and not too bad on the wallet.On a busy day or night parking can be tight. But,  other wise it is great. Check it out one day when you are on the East side of pghoenix. You just might like it.Even the name fails to covey what lies inside.Pizza Heaven is the type of place you could drive by and never even notice however, that would be a mistake because Pizza Heaven Bistro  is a great place to grab Italian food at a reasonable  price.I have been to Pizza Heaven a few times and have never been disappointed. The menu includes a wide variety of pizzas along with a tasty selection of pasta entrée's.Pizza Heaven Bistro is fairly small however, they have a robust take out business as well as a very busy dine in traffic.  The food and the service are always good. The atmosphere  feels a bit like home. What more could you asked for.  Good food,  good service,  great prices.
Lidia's=I had a great lunch here!The service, TBH, was average, but they pre-bused the hell out of my table so I was incredibly delighted!(Lack of pre-bus is a HUUUUUGE pet peeve of mine!)There were several items on the menu that I really wanted to try and I was truly torn on what to get.There was a Wild Boar dish, a Salmon that sounded amazing, and a Duck dish that sounded awesome, too!I'll walk you through the meal...1.)  They bring you some delicious breads (a Rosemary and Sea Salt bread, and another plainer Italian bread) to dip into a plate that had 2 perfectly rounded scoops of spreads in a pool of olive oil.The scoops?  I think that one was an avocado-based spread and the other, I think, was a black bean spread--neither of them were overly flavorful, but both were relatively light and fresh.**My Faves Here:  Sea Salt & Rosemary Bread with the [Black Bean] Spread2.)  Next was salad: You can choose a Caesar salad or a pickier/plane salad (but the plane salad will take extra time to make because the servers prep the salads themselves--so it was explained to us, anyhow).The Caesar was good!  The anchovies are diced into the dressing, but you can barely recognize them if you're not a fan of anchovies and are worried about that.I honestly wouldn't have even known they were in there, had I not asked!**My Faves Here: Go for the Ceasar; it was great!3.)  For an appetizer (this is a weird choice, but I'm happy we did it), we got the "Chef's Vegetarian Sampler".  This included a delicious, and lightly spicy, Barley Risotto, some Sauteed Spinach, and some type of [fried] Potato dish.  It was very good!**My Faves Here:  The Potatoes were pretty addicting!**Least Faves Here:  The sauteed spinach--very garlicy!4.)  I ended up choosing "Lidia's Pasta Tasting Trio"--and I would recommend that to others who find themselves torn between several things.Here's how this works...There are 3 pastas "of the day".The servers bring around large bowls of all three types of pasta and places all three types on your plate for you to try.One you've sampled all three, its "all you can eat" of your faves.They'll ask you what types you'd like more of and give you more.Not a bad deal!The day that I went, all three were pretty good.One had a spicy, red sauce and wide noodles.Another had an olive oil based sauce and had Orecchiette pasta.The last one was the one that I could have eaten allllllll day!It was simple, but amazing!Goat Cheese filled Ravioli with a Butter and Thyme sauce!  Ugh... to die for!Let me tell you about this ravioli!They were not "doughey" at all; they were perfect!Very thin pasta, but none were broken!Delicate and perfectly filled with the most amazing cheese.The butter/thyme sauce wasn't the least bit overwhelming!It was the perfect compliment to this dish!...just thinking about it makes me want to go back to Lidia's NOW!**My Faves Here:  OBVIOUSLY the Goat Cheese Ravioli!**My Least Fave:  The Orcchiette dish.  It wasn't "bad", it was just "meh".5.)  Oh, yes... there WAS dessert, too!  ;)(don't judge me!  lots of folks have dessert at lunch-time!)  ;)I enjoyed the Tiramisu!Now, some people like it when the lady fingers in Tiramisu are very Rummy tasting, but I am not a fan of too much of that!This was perfect and delicious!I would def recommend it!All in all... Lidia's = WIN!PROS:  Delicious;Pre-bus galore!CONS:Parking (but you can park in the "dust bowl" across the street.Located in the stripPretty busy on the weekends!It's been a while since I've written about Lidia. Well, Lidia's, not Lidia the person. After a couple hit and miss visits with the various pasta trio tastings I had, I'd say I was back in Lidia's good graces with their massive brunch spread.I will give you ample warning, DO NOT EAT A SINGLE THING BEFORE YOU COME HERE FOR BRUNCH. For realsies. It's a crap ton of food! And the best part? It's a bargain! For $28 you get the brunch buffet, your choice of main course AND a mimosa or Bloody Mary. Isn't that a bloody good time? Why, yes, yes it is. You just have to roll me out afterwards!The buffet is awesome, with tons of traditional anti pasta's, meat trays, soups and salads. I actually went two weeks in a row (I know... that's a lot!) and got to see that they actually change out the buffet items quite a bit. The first week I went I had a delicious bean salad and artichoke salad. The second week I came they had fried risotto balls, which I promptly had about a million of... and tasty mussels. For your main course there's about 12 different options to choose from, including the pasta trio of the day! The first week I went with the Salmon over beans and potatoes. I asked for it rare, and rare it came out! It was very flavorful and I liked the charred pieces. I could have used a few more veggies underneath, but the salmon was so large (about 8oz I swear) that it just took over the entire plate! The second week I had stuffed cabbage and mash potatoes. Odd for a polish meal to be on the menu, but it was delicious. I'd have to say even better than the salmon. I loved stuffed cabbage and the mash potatoes were certainly home made and not instant (could you imagine the horror if they were instant?). With all that food it's hard to believe I had room for dessert. But how could you NOT indulge when it's also on the buffet just staring at you waiting for it's chance to be eaten! The first week I took the traditional tiramisu, which was fantastic! I like tiramisu that's not too espresso tasting and this was perfection. Very light and tasty. The second week they had a lemon tiramisu and it was a little slice of lemon heaven. Even better than the regular. I shoved so much in my mouth I thought I was going to throw up. But it would have been all worth it, I swear!So heed my warning, friends! You will thank me as you're rolling yourself outta there!
Welcome Diner=So a couple of months ago my co-worker and I were on a dangerous mission to find the one great burger in town. After months of search and going into some of the seediest joints in town, we arrived at Welcome Diner, I was a bit skeptical that this place could produce a burger  that my co-worker and I were so desperately seeking, but oh how rad being wrong is, they knocked the shit out of my taste buds with there burger, I got a double with cheese with a fried egg on top (old school son), I literally finished the burger before my co-worker got his (which was like 5 seconds later) , a true delight. If you go bring cash money thats all they take, also its a small joint so don't go brining like 40 of your office buddies you'll look like a tool.I have been here 3 times. 2 times to eat and once I forgot cash. The first time was not great the fryer was down and the fry's sucked. The 2nd time was a little better. Except the food inspector was there. Normally this is a non-issue but in a diner car that serves 9 you hear and see everything. We ordered 2 doubles and 1 fry and a bottle of coke. One burger was made incorrectly as they added grilled onions to both. I was feeling generous and did not ask for a new one. (I should have though, I do not care for onions on the burger) The fry's were good, in fact I could have eaten another order. The cook Andy and the waitress were so frazzled by the inspector they kept forgetting things like opening the bottle of coke, ketchup, other peoples meals, the "regular" got a double when he ordered 2 singles and made sure Andy knew it was 2 singles...The other "regular" looked as if she rolled out of bed, smoked a J, slapped her over sized headphones and Ipod in her PJ pocket and rode her bike here. She totally dumped her bike in the front, like she owned the place. Andy asked several times for her to move it but pot head didn't get it. Andy asked the other regular to do something for him discreetly since the city guy was there, not sure what but he was outside for a while.  I like Welcome but with 2 issues in 2 visits I dunno If I will be back.The enthusiastic Chef Payton Curry has taken over the Welcome Diner for now, offering his unique culinary creations to the public on a limited time basis. The self proclaimed "guerrilla gourmet" has an emphasis on using local, fresh ingredients, which he obtains at local farmers markets and direct from local farmers. He cooks up all types of cuisine, but he also caters to the vegetarian/vegan eating crowd.My wife and I visited this past Tuesday and were treated to a scrumptious 6 course vegan meal tasting that we thoroughly enjoyed. If you're looking for some local, delicious, gourmet food whipped up by a chef who truly enjoys his craft (and makes it show in his food), a visit to Chef Payton Curry is a MUST!Full review with photos at: http://wesnovack.com/gourmet-vegan-dining-with-paytoncurrys-local-vegetable-dishes/HOURS (from paytoncurry.com )We will open on every first Friday of each month and every SUNday, MONday, and TUESday 5pm-CLYou will also be able to book the inside 8 seats on Wednesday-Saturday and have Payton mess with your palette while he doesn't hold his tongue. Contact for more info..BEST BURGER SPOT I'VE COME ACROSS!! I was out one night craving a burger and jumped on yelp and happened to be driving down roosevelt. This was the first place that came up. I drove down and stopped by. This place is really cool. I like the open setup outside. There's benches for you and your friends to chill on while u enjoy your meal.  There's a dinner car that seats about nine people that's cool to sit in. The service is GREAT!!! All the people there are super cool. A very friendly atmosphere that anyone can enjoy. When your foods ready they always check to make sure everything's right before giving it to you. Now.... The burgers and catfish sandwiches are AMAZING!!! I have had the welcome burger, the peanut butter burger and the Friday night catfish poor boy!!! All left smiles on my face wanting more. You have to try this place out!!! IT'S A DEFINITE MUST!!!First off, the food is incredible. The menu is very simple and to the point. Don't let that fool you. I got the sausage corn dogs. YUMMY. A must try. Also the fried green tomato sandwich. The bread they use is quality and so tasty. I gave it 4 stars because I feel like the staff could be friendlier. And eventually, I'd love a bigger beer selection. Try. This. Place.Part of the charm of this place is that it is in a poor residential neighborhood in downtown Phoenix, not far from 7th St.  Also, you could easily drive by and not even notice it exists.  So charming and the loveliest of dives you will ever visit (or shizzhoels as I call them).Now, about the food and experience.  When you walk inside there is only about 8 or so counter seats in what looks like a converted studio home/living room.  The feeling when you walk in however, is that someone beamed you into the 1950's.  Authentic and totally retro.Now, the best for last... the food is not your typical diner food.  Much more creative and original than any diner I have ever been to.  And being from NY I KNOW diners!  Practically grew up in them.  This diner, while having a VERY limited menu (when compared to any NY diner), each and every dish is incredible.  Try the Big Jim!  It will wow you... Fried Chicken breast  with cheddar, bacon, homemade biscuit buns and gravy.  Wowah!  (Oh, and definitely not the dish or the place to be if you wanna eat healthy!  More the once in a blue moon calorie splurge place... at least for me.)Oh and order off the menu the "Cannibal Fries".  Simply off the chain.  Fresh cut potato fries with caramelized onions, cheddar and homemade russian dressing.  (Deep Breath!)I told my hubby we absolutely had to stop by welcome diner during our trek to Phoenix. From downtown we took a short lightrail ride (because he doesn't like to walk recreationally) then ironically still had to walk for what appeared to be forever through the sketchy part of town -- no we didn't take the art district route.The diner literally is a mobile kitchen. Bigger than a food truck, I mean enough to situate a counter, a line of barstools and the cooking area. The guys on board are super friendly, accommodating and truly love the contribution they've made to the community.Yes this little kitchen serves cocktails and beer.We ordered the acclaimed big Jim, two of them, hash browns and beignets. Our big Jims were delicious. Extremely hearty with extra gravy. Unfortunately, however, without the gravy, the biscuit would be just thirst inducingly dry. I suppose that would be one way to get you to drink more!  Again loved the gravy. They even gave me a ramikin of their mushroom gravy cause they felt I had to try it..also quite delicious. The hash browns and beignets were alright but didn't contribute to this diner's stars.We were impressed with our main entrees and by the guys who run this little miracle on wheels.
Fiesta Cafe=Ah, Fiesta Cafe.You do not deserve all five stars on food alone, but there are so many additional factors.First off, Fiesta Cafe is a flagrantly ridiculous adobe structure, looking as if it was transplanted straight from the American Southwest into the midst of First Street in Champaign.  Ridiculous.  Awesome.  Hilarious.Next, the service is fast, friendly, and the food delicious.  I ordered the chilequiles, which I'm a bit particular about.  I also wanted them with scrambled eggs, which seemed odd and self-indulgent, but they did it PERFECTLY.  And I was delighted.  The food was great, and i was pleasantly surprised as I thought it'd suck or be midwesternly bland.Finally, as I left the patio, full and happy, i stopped and looked about.  There are a plethora of flags, American, Mexican, Peace, LGBT Rainbow, a whole plethora of flagtasticness.  'Twas nice to see a cool, friendly environment.So, in conclusion: Ridiculous pueblo, frighteningly good chilequiles, flagtasticness, wondrous service.  I was delighted.
Del Taco=Okay so I have to make a confession... Del Taco has some of the tastiest Chocolate Fudge Cake around. In addition to the nummy little thing being just the right amount for under $1.50, you can get it at 3:00 a.m. when there is no hope of finding such a treat elsewhere.You will never catch me having a crispy shrimp taco (the idea of seafood from a fast food place makes me want to hack), but holy bajeebus... that cake is like crack!
George & Dragon Restaurant=I went somewhere tonight that I wish was George & Dragon, which made me realize that I had never written a review for one of my favorite standby restaurants.  So I wanted to give my 100th review to a place so deserving of recognition.I've been to G&D dozens of times in the past 8 years, and I can honestly say that I've never had a bad meal or bad service.  As a vegetarian, my favorite meal was always the Cornish Pasty. Mmm. Just thinking about it makes my mouth salivate.  A beautifully flaky pastry filled with potatoes and vegetables.  And peas, I love peas.  So yummy, I can't really remember many other meals there, although I do remember having a very good roast beef recently.The booths are awesome. The owner is incredibly British, and it shows.  There is a ton of authentic paraphernalia decorating these walls.  Plenty of British ales as well.  It's the standard to which I compare all British pubs in the valley.So many reviews so I'll keep it short. I really enjoyed this place I would soooo go here often if I lived closer, like probably daily. Guiness, good food selection and Spotted Dick!! K?? K!!I've always wanted to try this place after I heard their weird radio commercials a few years back.  It always cracked me up whenever the guy talked about the bangers and mash.  We finally stopped by one day after a lovely little trip on the lightrail.The entrance is a little confusing being on the south side of the building.  I guess this is because I am used to entrances being in the fronts of buildings as opposed to on the side.  When you walk in, you see everything you expect.  A couple pool tables, dingy floors, a seedy looking bar, and tables and chairs scattered about.  There are a decent amount of booths as well.  One thing that I noticed and considered a bit odd was the fact that a third of the restaurant seemed to be sort of partitioned off for the "fancy" dining area.  I don't know if that is the case, but it definitely looked that way.  When it comes down to it, this place is a classically tacky pub type restaurant, and I like it.Unfortunately, the food is not so great.  Neither is the bitchy service you get when you come in.  A half smile would be a welcome gesture instead of a perfect view of my server skulking in the kitchen.  I'm not sure what was up with that.  Maybe PMS.  The husband ordered the bangers and mash and I got the cornish pastie.  The husband mentioned that he had to add a lot of salt to his gravy, but he seemed to enjoy his meal.  Me on the other hand, not so much.  My gigantic pile of peas that kept rolling of my plate were cold and had a few hairs in them.  They definitely weren't mine, I checked.  The pastie was delicious, and I really liked it, but the accompanying mashed potatoes were too thick and lumpy to be any good.This place just isn't good enough.  Hair in food is just plain gross.  Mediocre food combined with rude service is not going to get me to come back.  Besides, I am sick and tired of hearing the owner of this place bitch and moan about the lightrail being a detriment to his business.  I don't know how you can say that when the place is packed on a Sunday afternoon with no sporting events going on.Riding the light rail daily to work has changed how I go about my commute home. It was by the grace of a good friend that I stopped off for a happy hour special at a Midtown drinkery. That's all it took to get me hooked on the idea of stopping off for a drink after a hard day's work. And the proximity of George & Dragon to the light rail launched what is my current obsession.With good intentions, I stopped at G&D yesterday for an Irish Car Bomb and a Guinness, and to get some food to take home and watch a movie. At 5:15 there was hardly anybody there, but I suppose most people are commuting at that time. I overheard another patron ask about their "Slay The Dragon" program. Participants, it so happens, are given a card with all of the restaurant's beer listed. The steady drinker consumes one of each (there are 66 different beers!!) within a month and is awarded with an "I Slayed the Dragon" t-shirt. What a sweet concept! ***The steak and kidney pie was also a nice treat, with that certain crispness of the kidney strong but not overpowering. In the past, I've also gotten the fish and chips (FanTasTic!), bangers and mash (excellent) and the wings (very good).*** I think it would be swell if we organized a daily UYE to help each other through this beer challenge. Even if it's only done during happy hour (4-7) after work,  that's only 3-4 beers a day.G&D was our first stop for our Pub Crawl, the fried food sampler was good and the drinks were decent pour and priced. The server was nice and everything went well. The location is lose to a rail station with just a short walk.all hail the brits, summer hours and day drinking benders with my brother. oi, oi, oi!my brother joey calls me up one day: "hey, can you drive me downtown tomorrow?"me: "why?"joey: "i have school down there in the afternoon, but i was invited to go bar hopping after class tomorrow night with some friends. i don't want leave my car out there overnight if i'm going to be drinking."me: "well, my company lets us have summer hours on fridays, so i'm done with work at noon. when's your class?"joey: "not til 6pm... but we can go earlier and grab beers or lunch first at this british pub near my school."me: "done. pick you up at 1:30pm." click.now this was in early august, so it was blazing hot that day. i pull into the george & dragon parking lot a bit dismayed there was no covered parking. oh sweaty joy.the good news is, it's nice and cool inside and strangely crowded for a work day.  we find seats right up at the bar. i notice the girls working there all have this suicide girl thing going on and the one guy we see working there (who appeared to be the manager?) has this MASSIVE pompadour thing going on with his hair. it was larger than life... like that thing you try not to stare at, but can't help it. in my peripheral vision, i could see my brother look over at me. i knew exactly what he was thinking and i smirk. then mr. pompadour-manager guy comes right over to us and asks if we would like menus. my brother smiles and nods a yes at him, fighting back laughter. while we're pouring over the menu's we order some pints. i decided that i fancied a kiltlifter while my brother orders the fuller esb. i try a sip of his, and crikey it's good. they're extra cold too and go down smooth. i end up ordering the fish & chips with the cole slaw and my brother opts for the sheperd's pie. my brother, never one for being a wimpy little nancy boy decides to order a shot of whiskey with this next round. i get the boddingtons this time, he gets the harp. me: "um, don't you have class? won't you be knackered by the time 6pm rolls around if you do a shot of whiskey?"joey: "nah, i'll be fine. we just have a quick test and then we can leave. i'll ace it."me: "well, cheers to that then."  *i raise my glass, clink*finally our food comes...... and i only have 2 words for the perfectly golden crispiness of the fish and chips i had for lunch: DAMN GOOD.we finished off our grub just as this cheeky lady and her husband sit down next to us. we chat them up over more pints (i have water, because i'm driving) until 6pm rolls around. i visit the bathroom upon our departure and am happy to report while initially it looks a bit dodgy, it's actually quite clean. we wave goodbye to mr pompadour-manager and we're off.i found out later my brother got an A on that test. HA. figures.good show george & dragon, all hail the queen! cheerio.From the other descriptions I am reading, I believe our party had the same blond bartender.  Granted she didn't curse out anyone in our party, but it wasn't a very pleasant experience.  It's like she can't be bothered and perform her job in pleasant manner.  Why employ anyone like that?  Last time I checked, restaurants were in the SERVICE industry, so provide better service or customers won't come back.Good place.When I want to get my English on, this is the first place I think of!!! The owner of this pub is the funniest, sweetest bar owner I have ever met! Each time my girlfriends and I go here he is always greeting us and sits down and chats! My favorite night is trivia nights on Thursday evenings. It's always fun to test you and your friend's random knowledge. The best part is, everyone in the bar participates and everyone gets into it. Not only can you enjoy great food, delicious beers and fun people, the winners of trivia get free food and drinks! How does this not sound like a great place to visit?! Just an FYI this place gets crazy around soccer, I mean football season!!! Fun place to check out!UK pub atmosphere in PhoenixI have never been to a pub in the UK.  Howerver, I have a image in my mind of what a pub in the UK might look like and George and Dragon made that image a reality.George and Dragon is unpolished, and unpretentious.  The atmosphere is very relaxing and welcoming.  As I  sat muling over the menu I enjoyed listening to the random music being played.  In the short time I was at George and Dragon I  listened to  metal, George Michael, Aretha Franklin, classical and everything in between. The customer service at George and Dragon in amazing.  The servers  were very accommodating without being intrusive. Our server took the time to explain the menu and even offered suggestions based on our preferences.Moving onto the food.  The food at George and Dragon is great and served piping hot (which I truly enjoy).  The unique combinations of flavors were prepared and presented perfectly.  My lunch party and I tried Bangers & Mash, Roasted Vegetable Pastie, fish& chip, Shepherd Pie, and Meatloaf. All of the entrées were delicious. Even though we were full from lunch because at George and Dragon the servings are large. We had to try dessert. So we ordered blackberry crumble and  bread pudding.  I have to say the bread pudding  was the best I have ever had.We will definitely be making this place a regular stop.I used to like this place as my hang out on Friday nights. I used to be friends with the bar staff and owners.  I am Indian from India with a nice beard. Some one offered me drinks and skipped on their tab and the bar wanted me to pay for the other persons tab even after my tab was already taken car of. I refused because it was not my drinks. I offered to pay for my share. But the owners brother, who I thought I was friends with showed his true colors and  told me I was not welcome at the bar anymore. George and Dragon used to be my favorite go to spot to hang out for drinks, but after the type of insult and racism I experienced, I do not think that it is a place I should go to anymore. Maybe all us ethic people should visit this british pub to make it feel authentic like it is in England with a lot of ethnic people.This is probably my favorite neighborhood bar, and mostly because it's just a hop skip and a jump from my front door - or a scoot on my bad*ss kick scooter. (like a razor scooter, but more awesome)Lock that puppy up (again, bad*ss scooter reference here) on their bike rack, hop in with your pals for a late night clandestine meeting of the minds - at least that's what it'll seem like after a few of those $3.75 well drinks on a Friday at 9 or 10 pm, when in reality, it was just two or more buffoons boozing around making fools of themselves.I'd say that I'm more a fan of neighborhood type bars than dance clubs, mostly because they tend to be lighter on the wallet than the latter. Call it a dive if you must, but I wouldn't classify George like that. Sure there's the obligatory pool tables and darts that make up a good dive. On any given evening, you might run into someone toting along their children for the 'grille' part of this bar and grille, but really, it's certainly more bar than grille by hefty proportions. I can't recall how many nights have ended at George, but you can rest assured that there will definitely be more.Happy Yelping Phoenix, come meet George, he's kind of awesome.
Boston Market=OK people. Let's face it. If it was called Cleveland Market, nobody would go. But throw in a trendy city's name and "Oh, it must be fantastic." After all Boston does have the Celtics. And they gave us Kristin and Jared. But can they pull off fast food. Yea, kinda sorta. It's nice to have a fast food option that is a "square meal." No burgers or fries. Roasted chicken, that holiday green bean casserole everyone loves but is too afraid to admit they eat it, mashed taters (gravy sucks ass though)...all pretty descent. We even tried the sirloin there, cooked medium rare, but WOW, it was like $12! So, I'm sure it's not even a Boston based company. And we all know it's nothing like a market. But three stars for dependable, un-bunned food! Oh. The cornbread? Seriously, it's "crack" good. I'd knock over school children just to get an extra one. As they say in Boston, "cheers." I know. Lame. Now, go get some cornbread!
Applebee's=The only good thing about Applebee's is that it gives bad parents somewhere to take their bratty kids while still having a "night out" so they don't infiltrate places that I actually want to go. One star for that.Two stars only if you stay in the bar and stick with beer and appetizers.Well folks, I did the chain thing. I confess. Rickie and I had spent and exhausting day (and a quick $200) at Target and were thinking steaks. The budget didn't include Morton's or Ruth's Chris. I had brain freeze and forgot the local spots I love so much that grill a mean meat (i.e. Phoenix City Grill), so the first restaurant past Target that fit the bill was our local Applebee's on Camelback and Central. Mind you, I don't expect a decor marvel or a hostess so hip it hurts. I know what i'm getting myself into. For the most part. But I had recently seen a TV commercial from Applebee's and of course the food was airbrushed so perfectly like Celine Dion's face on the current issue of HELLO magazine. I mean, really, Celine, you have no wrinkles even after living in Las Vegas these past couple of years? Anyhoo, we were greeted and seeted promptly by a teenager who definitley just had a smoke and could use a visit to the tanning booth. Once seated, our server, Mo, took our drink and appetizer order and quickly disappeared. For quite awhile. Cue the Jeoporady theme music. Once our iced teas and the new appetizer (tuscan cheese bread extravangza) arrived we sipped and dipped. Not bad.Raspberry tea with an univited yet delighted visit by vanilla and the cheese spread was rich and yummy served with a spot of diced tomato, basi and garlic...aka bruscetta. NICE. We ordered onion chips, like an onion loaf or the blooming onion at Outback....they were good. Two sauces for our dipping pleasure...one your typical ranch, the other a sort of spiced up thousand island with horseradish. Then the entrees arrived. Cue the creepy dum, dum, dum, music...Both NY strip steaks over cooked to such an extreme. The asparagus was limp like, well, let's just say it reminded me of a Vietmanese gymnast I once dated who didn't take the little blue pill. Sides included mashed potatoes (loaded) which means bacon, cheese and sour cream. Ok, Ok, Ok, too much of the extras. What ladle in the kitchen did they pick to put these extras on my mashed potatoes? All in all, I had low expectations at this venue, and they were met. Shout out to Mo the server, a good gal! The clientele was like a scene out of Dawn of the Dead. Sorry. Lesson learned...Applebee's ok some of the time. Get an app and a drink. Skip the entrees. Be nice to a nice server. And for God's sake don't expect a steak worthy of the big chain peeps.I will give this Applebees location a 5 star and here's why. I used to work here and know the cooks and staff. I have inside information on how this location does things in relationship to other locations I had filled in at. This location has better cooks and better management than some of the other locations. It shows in the food. Very seldom do I eat at this location and get a bad meal. Best nights to go Friday or Saturday after 4pm. The best cooks are working then, these guys have been at this location for over 8 years and they know what they are doing.
Rainbow Donuts=If I were to stop and get a donut here..I am not saying I have, just if I did ..I have to say they remind me of the ones I love from So Cal.  They would I am guessing, have that light greasiness combined with sweetness. Probably they are lightly iced .I bet if I went there I would really like an old fashioned one. Just if I went there.I'm out of the closet!Yay!No more hiding who I really am!I'm a proud member of the Rainbow Donuts coalition.It's not a choice...not just a lifestyle selection (although the donut selection is, in fact, quite robust)...no, it's how I am constructed!OK, actually I'm bi...I enjoy the occasional "breakfast burrito", but if I'm pressed to choose...I'll take the hole and the "Old Fashioned Glazed" that surrounds said hole.That and a good cuppa.And that's one of the things that separates Rainbow from the rest...the coffee...outstanding Italian roast, well made and very inexpensive...with enough refills to take a bath in.And I would bathe in the coffee (and possibly the donut glaze) except for the inevitable "dust-up" that always occurs when I let my impulses run wild and free!Don't get me wrong...the donuts are terrific and the nice young lady behind the counter was almost as sweet as the apple fritters.I had a client meeting there this morning (I know, I spare no expense!), and my clients were just as charmed as I was with Rainbow...the great coffee, the terrific donuts and fritters and the pleasant service (not to mention free wi-fi for my meeting) all combine to make Rainbow Donuts a significant step above the rest.Most of all, it's the place where I can feel free to be my real, authentic self...out, loud and proud!And growing a little with each fritter.
Oaxaca Sky Harbor=I went to this airport foodery with thoughts of getting a great Oaxacan meal at Sky Harbor Airport. But that was a fantasy. Not sure why I ever thought that, maybe it was just the Oaxaca name.This is burritos to go. I ordered a Machuca Oaxaca burrito, Machuca being shredded beef mixed with onions and chilis. The Burrito was surprisingly small. I agree with Eli's first review. It was not that tasty, and it was real watery or wet. I went through 10 napkins, because everytime I squeezed the burrito by taking a bit, a puddle appeared below the burrito. It got to be irritating, as I didn't want greasy stains on my clothes, so I was trying real hard to wrap up this burrito so it wouldn't leak from the bottom. It still leaked. After every bite. A little puddle I would wipe up with yet another napkin. The chili sauce was spicy, and was perhaps the best thing about the food. Machuca Burrito and drink totalled $8.53.I hate to admit it, but It made me crave for Chipotle!I still love this place and I got dinner to take home for us here last night.It was hot and fresh, and oh so good!Their portions seem a bit smaller than they used to be. But, I am noticing that every where now. They still sell everything at a really good prices. They make the tortillas fresh here and everything is nice and hot when you get it.Their salsa is divine. So good.I of course got my favorite, Chicken Delight with Verde Sauce. Loved it! There staff is really nice always, very happy and friendly. You have to love that. When most people in the Airport are a bit on the Grumpy side.
Miracle Mile Delicatessen=Dear Miracle Mile,This is the last time you will ever sucker another $15 bucks from me for bland, over-salted cafeteria food. I hate to be the rabid cur of dissent in this love fest, but I can no longer fake it and go with the flow. I despise everything about you, Miracle Mile.Unless someone had cued me into the fact, I never would have guessed that you were trying so hard to duplicate NY deli-style fare. Why so? Because every NY staple I've tried from your fetid excuse for a deli has sucked so effing hard it just about pulls grey matter out through my ears. Stale and mealy defrosted cheesecake that was as unappetizing to look at as to consume. Matzo ball soup so bland I had to keep looking down to assure myself I was indeed consuming something other than hot air. Wilted salads guaranteed to deflate my hopes upon first bite. Vegetable soup that was so flavorless as to be nearly nonexistent. Are you trying that hard to fade into the background, you wallflower? It's no wonder the median age of a patron in your restaurant is pushing 80. The near total annihilation of my taste buds is the only way I would ever step foot through your doors again.And then there's your pathetic excuse for a sandwich, Mile. Pastrami and corned beef sandwiches piled (not so) high with bland, fatty meat that's been slopped with reckless abandon atop your choice of bread, guaranteed to disintegrate in five seconds flat. All topped off with a slice of sweaty Swiss cheese that adds zero flavor and flops listlessly atop a piteous excuse for a sandwich. If it weren't for the spicy mustard at each table, I'd hardly have tasted anything at all! Bravo! You surely deserve an award for the most poorly constructed sandwich in all of Phoenix! Although I guess that dubious honor should clearly be bestowed upon your brusque, monosyllabic cafeteria line workers. "Next? Bread?" Unappetizing slop of meat, slid down the line to the next guy. "Fries?" Heap of fried garbage, liberally applied, slid down the line. That is, unless you're asking for something outside of the crap-sandwich-and-fries box. At that point your request will be wordlessly acquiesced to with a scowl and a slop. "Drink?" No! Please! NO! Just get me out of this slovenly pit of cafeteria hell. What do you want, I'll pay anything! Anything!Wait a tic. That's your whole ploy all along, isn't it Miracle Mile? Brainwash the masses with mediocre food and overcharge for everything to make it seem like it's a privilege to be dining upon such slop.Well I'm on to you. I've given you plenty of chances, Mile. Your Reuben was the only sandwich that didn't make me want to violently upend tacky cafeteria tables on the way to my car. Wishing you the bland, inoffensive dreams of an automaton,EricaSo, I love deli food.  a lot.  I've tried a few deli's out here, including these guys, and I have to say, I think I like them!Prices here are typical deli, but from what I can tell, cheaper then others.  You can get just about anything, anyway you want.  I love how they have Matzoh Ball soup, big huge deli sandwiches, and all the fixings.  YUM!The past few times I've eaten here, its been on lunch with coworkers.  I've kept it light with my order, since falling into a food coma and taking a nap at my desk after a huge lunch is generally frowned upon by management.I've gone with the Kosher beef hot dog, fries, pickle, and tiny pop for a grand total of $5.24.  My friend usually gets the tuna on wheat while here, and she likes it here as much as I do!What I do find odd, is that its buffet style serving.  You walk through the line, give your order, and walk down with your plate while the guys behind the glass fix your order.  Service here is quick and efficient, and seating is plentiful, even during the lunch rush.I would recommend this place to most anyone, and they have multiple valley locations.  yummy!
Blimpie=Noon and I'm starving! hadn't eaten since the night before... i could feel my stomach slowly eating itself! after picking up some stuff on my way back to work i saw Blimpies... as usual... seen it a million times but never stopped in. there were a few folks inside... looked cozy enough.. the lady behind the counter wasn't very social... just what do you want.. and that was it... :( i had a toasted 6in with roast beef/ turkey/ cheddar... They didn't have very many veggies to choose from..... not even pickles... for some reason the sandwich was really small and was not filling at all... i was still hungry... It left me wishing i had chosen subway instead... and just for that dinky sub i spent $4.75... Not worth it in my book...
Coup Des Tartes=My boyfriend summed up our experience at Coup Des Tartes pretty well, even with the spelling and grammar issues - I swear he's college educated; he just thinks it's 'kool' to 'right' in his own unique style :)I'm just going to add my own two cents...After reading so many great reviews of this place, we were both pretty excited to try it out.  I made our reservations online with no problem.  As he said, going on a Wednesday night was perfect - it was not too crowded and we received great service. Claire and Mona took great care of us... great ambiance and food too - To start, I went with the Roquefort Salad (their signature salad) and it was delicious! Jared was happy with his mussels appetizer as well.  They brought plenty of bread and butter for him to sop up the sauce as well - it too was fresh, moist, and yummy. Jared had the chicken entree and I had the lobster... I really enjoyed it - the lobster itself was flavorful and it also had a light sweet sauce (with coconut) that enhanced each bite.  I liked that it came with asparagus as well as a risotto.  I didn't love that the risotto had pineapple in it, but that may be just me.  We didn't need it but J twisted my arm to share a dessert... chocolate crusted cheesecake with an orange sauce and fresh berries - the perfect sweet ending to a wonderful meal!If you like quaint, unique, local places, check out Coup Des Tartes - you won't be disappointed!Loved it!!!We went there last Friday night to be romantic and it definitely did the trick. I had never experienced a BYOB restaurant before and after experiencing it first hand I am hooked. We started the evening with the fillet Mignon tacos and they were fabulous, the perfect start. I had the chicken breast. It was stuffed with goodness and was served with squash, corn, and garlic mashed potatoes. A drizzle of pesto lined the outside of the dish and was the perfect accompaniment. My husband has the salmon as was very impressed (I don't do fish so I can't go into more detail). For dessert we had the four berry tarte, it was warm and the perfect end to a fabulous meal. They serve the type of food that continues to come up in conversation throughout the evening, in a good way.Coup Des Tartes was really a 3.5 experience for me, but I'm going to round up.My husband and I chose Coup Des Tartes for our anniversary dinner this year for a few reasons - 1. BYOB.  2. We love French food and always go to a French restaurant for our anniversary and 3. Its billed as being romantic.  Those seem like pretty reasonable requirements, right? First of all, this is not French food.  Sure, there are French inspirations and they serve brie but the menu is largely American with all sorts of influences.  (My husband's entrée had cous cous!)  Second of all, I didn't find it romantic.  I guess if you use romantic to mean the same things an East Coaster means when they say "intimate" or "cozy"....which to everyone else means cramped.  I wouldn't have minded the close quarters had it not been so loud!  The loud ambiance and the bright lights killed most of the romantic atmosphere. The food was solidly good.  There was no "close my eyes and savor" moment.  My husband enjoyed his lamb, even if it was definitely not a French preparation.  I ordered the lobster, as I've heard Australian lobster is the best of the Pacific lobsters.  It was good but I'll take a Maine lobster any day.  Naturally, we had a tarte for dessert. I have to say was the most dissapointing part.  I was expecting one large circular tarte and what was placed in front of me was a pie slice of a tarte.   I think that Coup Des Tartes would work best for a small group....I think 6 may be too big.  It does work for a date, just don't expect it to be too romantic.  The prices aren't outrageous so it would make a nice night out with a significant other or friends.  I think for a special occasion you can do better.Updating my review after a horrible experience trying to utilize their private room, Rendevous, for a birthday dinner.  Their event coordinator dropped the ball with several huge miscommunications during the 4 weeks we were in touch, and then went MIA for a week and a half before the event.  In the 11th hour, three days before the event and ON my actual birthday, I had to pull the event when there was no way to find a mutually-agreed upon solution that would preserve the original intent of the evening.  I had to inform my 27 guests of the last-minute location change via e-mail after sending formal invitations weeks in advance. The entire experience was a nightmare and having the owner yelling at me on my birthday was not the highlight of my week.  The most unprofessional and offensive experience I have ever had within the service industry.Coup des Tarte delivers exactly what its name suggests, a ravishing blow to the palette that storms your mouth by force and takes no prisoners.  The chocolate and caramel fleur de sel tart is a testament to the aphrodisiac quality of fine food, and it had me moaning at the table heedless of surrounding company, who conveniently were also moaning with pleasure after sampling the four berry tart with vanilla gelato, so at least I was in good company. The small converted house lends a homey, romantic feel with wood floors, soft curtained windows for natural light and warm walls that were decorated with a discerning eye for color.  The tables are small and a bit crowded, but are not close enough that you will end up distracted by surrounding conversation.  It is most assuredly not a place to bring a large group of people, with a count of four being about the max for a comfortably seated party.One thing I adore is that it's BYOB, which is a blessing because their menu is pricey enough as it is without tacking on the inevitable, exorbitant price of alcohol.  Instead they charge a nine dollar corking fee and provide all the necessary accoutrement for opening and chilling your selection during the meal. The appetizers are consistently delicious.  The three onion tart in particular is the perfect balance of sweet and smoky, with the tart crust and caramelized onions playing up the sweet side, and the smoky bacon with Gruyere cheese satisfying the savory.  It is an honest to goodness coup des tarte in your mouth, as has already been discussed.  The chevre cheese and tomato appetizer and country pate plate were also rich and savory, the walnut bread with the pate being particularly notable, although they lacked the complexity of the three onion tart and seemed much more savory. The entrees were perhaps the weakest portion of the meal, which was surprising considering they're naturally the most expensive.  The duck breast was cooked to perfection and wasn't too fatty, and the honey, lavender, rhubarb sauce was a beautiful compliment to the meat.  The accompanying green beans and mashed potatoes fell far short of the duck though, and could have used a more creative interpretation.  The Moroccan lamb shank with Israeli couscous and chickpeas, however, was off the charts delicious!  It was fall of the bone tender and all the components of the meal were highly complimentary.  The sea bass I've had on previous visits also suffered the same fate as the duck, with an ultimately well prepared and scrumptious protein accompanied by lack luster sides. But ultimately it is the dessert course that is the crowing jewel of this establishment. Don't say, "Well I never order dessert." Or "But I'm watching my weight."  Believe me, you want these perfectly prepared, sweet and salty concoctions to make love to your mouth.  Every tart I have ever tasted has elicited the same sleepy smiles of contentment and pleasurable moans.  In fact, it might even be a better investment to go a nontraditional route and just skip right from the appetizers to the dessert course.  That way you can order several varieties and indulge in blissful, sugary enjoyment.I'm updating my review based on an other incredible meal at Coup Des Tartes on this past Thursday night.  I went with a party of nine. Most of our group ordered off of the Yelp Eats menu, but I mixed it up a bit and ordered off the regular menu instead (hence my review here instead of under the "Yelp Eats" listing).I started with the Roquefort Salad (the house specialty) - it was just as amazing as I remembered.  My fiance was literally "foodgasming" over the onion tarte appetizer (and I admit, my bite of that was pretty amazing) but the perfectly dressed salad filled with organic greens, roasted apples, toasted hazelnuts, dried figs & Premier Cru Roquefort had me pretty much there myself!The entrees at the table were pretty amazing too... I tasted the lamb (yum!) and the fettucine (delicious) - but I ordered the baby scallop appetizer with a side of spinach as my entree and I was extremely happy with my selection.  I actually kept my mouth shut during the dessert course, but from the looks of the various tarte selections at the table and how quickly they disappeared, it's safe to say that none were too shabby.  There were no complaints at our table.We love that Coup Des Tartes is BYOB - just a $9 corkage.  Our friends brought a Riesling from Germany, we added a Turley to the mix, and enjoyed a bottle Bordeaux as well.Rhiannon, our waitress, took great care of our party, and we cannot wait to return again and again!Just left here not fifteen minutes ago.One table of ladies with one rude woman sat next to us. Not the restaurants fault, yet irritating that such people exist.Lemonade to drink, just fine as is.Brie Brulee 12Quite uninspired in presentation and the brie was very ordinary, my friends Mer and Mike serve one of much higher quality.French Dip Sandwich 12This one was with salad. Another lackluster presentation, but that would have been ok if were good. It was not, or at least to me. The beef was cut too thick and with it being too well done and the gristle made for a tough sandwich with little redeeming flavour.It was left half eatenChicken Cordon Blue 10I did not eat this, but Brice told me it was ok if all you were expecting is a chicken and ham sandwich. He did finish.We had mentioned we wanted to talk with someone about renting the extra room, or get a card. The wait person said ok after we are done she will send someone out.We did sit a while after we were done; no one came out or was a card offered. But it might have been because I guess I caught her off guard earlier.  In the middle of eating our sandwiches she asked if everything tasted good. I said no, she looked at me as if she did not understand, so I repeated that I did not like my food. Talk about someone's face changing from a smile to a deer caught in the headlights, she stammered and said sorry then ran off. NO question of why I felt displeasure or any thought of remedy. It did give us a chuckle with such lack of attention. But what it also did was make us reconsider if we should even think about the room for a party.So once again I am in the minority since no rave from me.Oh yeah and we had to ask for forks. Hahhahhahhah oh well.......If you're on Twitter you'll see so many different places you can follow. Its cool to because they announce deals and such that are coming soon. For instance, Coup des Tartes tweeted that they would be running the Yelp Eats menu this past Friday and Saturday. I was super excited because the night I was supposed to go there was a family emergency and I had to cancel. Anyway, once we arrived we were given the standard menu so we asked about the Yelp Eats menu, "oh yeah sure". What was brought back was not the Yelp Eats menu but some 3 course prix fix menu for $25 that didn't even have one Yelp Eats item on it. No onion tart, no lamb shank etc.. VERY disappointing and irritating. Do not call a Ferrari a Corvette, no matter how you slice it, they aren't the same thing. Anyway.. ended up ordering the pate and onion tart appetizers. The pate is not house made and tasted like liverwurst, the onion tart was very good. However, once we learned that there was no wine service and a (correction, not $12) $9 corkage fee, that was the nail in the coffin, we were out the door. At the end of the day they falsely tweeted to get customers in the door then try to pass off something that isn't. Very misleading, the classic bait and switch apparently still works.My parents were in town a few weeks ago, and when my parents are in town, we like to take them to restaurants that they've never been to before.  My dad appreciates good food, and we had a feeling he'd like Coup Des Tartes, so that's where we found ourselves on that particular Saturday night.We brought the wine (a bottle of red and a bottle of white) and my parents picked up the tab... such a deal!  We were seated in the back room - one I'd never even seen before... there was just our table and three other tables in the little room.  I convinced my mom to share the signature salad with me to start... and although Jared asked my dad to share the onion tart as an appetizer, my dad insisted on ordering his own.  (It worked out though, so I was able to take a few bites of the tart too).  For our meals, my mom and Jared went with the chicken, I had the salmon, and my dad went for the steak.  My fish was cooked just perfectly and served with an amazing butternut squash risotto and some green beans too.  Everyone enjoyed their meals and despite the fact that we were all pretty full, we went ahead and ordered the mixed berry tart with four forks for dessert.  We cleaned that plate too.Needless to say, we were right about my dad enjoying his meal at Coup Des Tartes.  We've always had great meals at Coup Des Tartes and we're sure to be back again real soon.There's just something missing at Coup Des Tartes. How do they say? "je ne sais quoi..."?The interior ambiance is perfect. Probably the highlight.On my most recent visit, I had the three onion tarte, which has a lovely sweet flavor and the salmon. The salmon was so ordinary. It was cooked well but something was missing from the preparation for me. However, I loved, loved, loved the savory butternut squash risotto. If only the salmon had been as "ah mah zing" (citing the menu) as the risotto was!I've had the chicken option before, too. It was just fine. But, nothing has blown me away. And, bringing your own wine to enjoy has the potential to really compliment the whole experience. Make it richer.  The fact that it'll cost you $9 minimum just to open it (a task you literally do yourself) is a sore spot for me. I think that corking fee is waaay too high! It's fun to go to coup Des Tartes because the ambiance and you know you'll order a tarte for dessert. It's like, that you'll enjoy dessert is guaranteed -- but, there's something -- that "je ne sais quoi..." that's still lacking...
RA Sushi Bar Restaurant=Delirious from hunger and unable to think straight I let my daughter talk me into the worst decision I've made in quite sometime. We ordered a Tempura & California Roll Lunch Combo plus a tootsy maki and a tuna avocado roll rolled in toasted sesame seeds. The tempura arrived, everything was barely crisp, a tad greasy but otherwise somewhat edible. When we got our sushi rolls it was apparent with one look that they were total crap, however, starving as we were we decided to carry on and eat. Tootsy Maki= DooDoo Kaki! Don't be fooled by the long wait, they are not making these fresh to order. This was definitely a roll that was prepped and pre-rolled last night! The seaweed was chewy and slimy, the dried up rice almost broke my tooth and the crab mixture was like eating mayo that sat out over night. My Tuna and Avocado roll which I asked specifically to be rolled in TOASTED SESAME SEEDS, was no better with it's also chewy seaweed and RAW Sesame Seeds, I didn't order a damn big mac. WTF! The California roll that arrived lastly with the salad was the same kind of pre-rolled crap. We ended up leaving it. Unfortunately I had to pay for this shit, but made sure to thank the sushi guys for the worst sushi I've ever eaten and let them know that I knew they  had served us pre-rolled crap, and of course they had nothing to say but "have a nice day"! *vomits*I should explain I don't like sushi.  I have tried to like sushi.  I dated a guy many years ago who was really into sushi and he would take me to the best Omaha has to offer and show me how to use the chopsticks and mix the wasabi, the whole 9 yards.  I gave it the good ol' college try, and I just can't do it.  My stomach rolls over after a couple of pieces.  Well, I think that, combined with the fact that when he purchased his new 7 Series, I didn't writhe all over it like Tawny Kitaen,  made me less appealing.  Such is life.  Now I'm married to a man who doesn't like sushi either.  What was I saying?Oh yeah!  We had a great lunch at RA between movies.  We each had the shrimp tempura bento box, which came with 4 shrimps, a spring roll, a potsticker, a salad, miso soup, and some fluffy white rice for $8.95.  Everything was delicious.  We also tried their seaweed salad which was nice and fresh.  The service  was great too.We  had a few of their cocktails which if memory serves, were very tasty, but we got a little loaded and then went to see Gravity in 3D, so my memory is a little hazy.   It was one of THOSE afternoons.  I thought the lunch was definitely a great deal and would go back for that anytime.
Austin's Caribbean Cuisine=I now understand why I always see people eating in their cars in this parking lot. I didn't make it very far without sneaking a bite, and in the future I'll know not to press my luck and just enjoy my food with the others parked out front.There are definitely no frills here, I walked in the doors to a long counter with a woman standing behind it, a series of reach-in coolers behind her filled with assorted jamaican drinks amoung other things I didn't catch, and a fairly open kitchen with a stove, a steam table, a warmer, and some equipment around the corner I couldn't see. As noted in another review it was (refreshingly) very clean. The menu is posted on the window as you walk in, along the wall on the inside, and also on a chalk board inside. I don't know if the chalkboard changes at all, but it seemed to have the same items on it as the printed menus.I was a little torn by the options: red snapper, oxtail, curry, a stew, goat, jerk chicken... but I went with the jerk chicken. And then comes the decision on the sides... mac n cheese, cabbage, more rice n beans, greens.. I went with cabbage. A small plate is a whole to go container of rice & beans, chicken, and cabbage - so I have no idea what kind of food you get in a large plate. The desserts sounded fantastic, I almost got a rum cake but stopped myself. (That was the one moment I was happy I couldn't sit down and eat, because I knew if I had more time to debate with myself the rum cake would have been purchased.) My small plate and a ting came to around $11. Not bad. After I ordered, the box was assembled as I stood there, everything either sitting hot on the stove or warm in the steam table. I was a little surprised as she flashed the filled container to me in approval before she shut it, but looking back it was nice touch to be able to check my order right there instead of getting to my car (or home) and being disappointed. I got to my car and noticed a few others eating, took a few bites myself, and then continued home. (windows down, windows up made it too tempting to nosh at every stop light)The jerk was really nice, very mild and sweet. I almost wished it had a little bit more heat to it, but very good. The cabbage was a little on the salty side but once you start mixing it in with the perfectly cooked rice and beans it all evens out. I definitely want to try a few other items on the menu, and if they are anywhere near the caliber of the jerk, I know I'll be very happy with them as well.
Bobby D's Restaurant & Lounge=One year, by matter of coincidence, I was in Bobby D's for a drink after work on St. Patrick's day and I couldn't help but notice the steady stream of neighborhood folk coming in for take out corned beef and cabbage. This year, I enlisted a coworker to accompany me and bear witness to the fact that it was NOT a liquid lunch so I could see what the fuss was about! (It is a workday, after all!) For $7.95 you get a platter full of well-seasoned, fork-tender corned beef, at least a quarter of a boiled cabbage, cooked carrots and potatoes. A small plate featuring creamy horseradish, horseradish and spicy mustard was delivered with our meal. Corned beef sliders were another option ($5.95), although we took the traditional route. While the flavor on the corned beef was excellent (we detected a hint of cinnamon), the veggies lacked seasoning. Other fun facts about what you can find at Bobby D's: ~ Lots of neighborhood peeps sportin' their green on St. Patty's ~ TVs -- I got to watch a little of the NCAA tournament during lunch! ~ $1 vodka soaked gummy bears (an interesting novelty in which I did not indulge)
Yasha From Russia=I love love love this store!!! I go there whenever I feel kind of homesick (I grew up in Latvia) or when I want to get some Russian marinaded but not too salty pickles, just like my grandma used to make!Great selection of all kind of Russian and European beers! I always have something special to bring when I go to an American party ;)lots of Russian candy, sausages, pelmeni etc.the only reason I give 4 stars, because it's hit and miss, sometimes they don't have some things, or black bread is not very fresh...but what can one expect, it's highly specialized grocery store, it's not like tons of Russians live here and go there every day.Overall I highly recommend it to anybody, if you are not brave enough to try Russian food, at least you can try Russian beer or some Moldovian or Georgian wine ;)But semi-salted pickles are the best! mmmmmm I'm drooling just thinking about them :-p~This is a rather sizable store as ethnic specialty stores go; don't be deceived by how it looks from the storefront. There is a good selection of sausages and other cured meats, cheeses, refrigerated food items, beverages, dessert items, candies, and other grocery items too varied to mention here - look at the pictures I posted for a sampling of what the store has to offer. While most items here are Russian, there is also a lot of foods and beverages from other European countries such as Poland and the Baltic states. You can also come here for lunch from Monday to Friday  to try borscht, dumplings (pelmeni and vareneki), blintzes, and different kinds of sandwiches. I find the prices to be quite good, too, for the quality of the food and other merchandise they offer.
Chicken Box Cafe=I stopped by the Chicken Box to grab lunch today.  I hadn't been there for a long time, and I was really excited about getting some of their fried chicken, mac & cheese, and collard greens.  When I pulled into the parking lot I noticed a big sign hanging down from the roof proclaiming that the original owners were back and it was under new management.  I hate to say it, but the original owners have really messed up a good thing.  When I went inside the huge menu board that listed all the amazing soul food side dishes were gone.  I guess the new management is trying to just rip off Price's by having the only side dish be mediocre coleslaw and bad tater tots.  The real shame is that they obviously changed the fried chicken recipe.  Does anyone know where the old managers went?  I need more of there home cooking.  This new chicken box cafe is terrible.
Paisley Violin=I know a lot of my friends really like this place, but I just can't get over the bad service and the food really isn't that great. It's really close to my house, so I go a lot to hang out and listen to the music that they have come through. Seriously though, I have stopped eating there because I realized after the 4th time that I have had "digestive issues" EVERY time I eat there. No joke. When I did eat there, the food really wasn't that great. Usually a bite or two is good, then it just gets really gross. I've tried about every side item that they offer with there entree's and they are all pretty gross to me as well. The potato salad was the only thing that I actually thought was okay. And one time I went there and she listed off my choices for sides, I said "chips" her: "oh, we're actually out of chips" me: "soup" her: "we're out of that too now" me: "so really, what are my actual choices?" her: "salad". Sorry to all my friends who like it, but it's really not that great. I think people come in and are charmed by the homey, inner-city art dive feel it has.A Phoenix original if ever there was one!  Total gem in the lower Grand Avenue area.I love the unique atmosphere here.  Post-industrial meets shabby-chic meets post-modern meets trading post.  Or something like that.I wanted something different and ordered the Panini Cubano.  I thoroughly enjoyed the shaved prosciutto, black beans, melted swiss, pickles and chipotle mayo.  I also sampled the sandwiches of my wife and daughter and they were very tasty as well.  They had the pesto chicken and the lamb gyro, respectively.The Paisley Violin is now firmly  entrenched on my list of cool, reasonable and unique places to grab lunch and to take visitors from out of town.
Pei Wei=I have to agree with Patti B. that this location pretty much sucks.  The service is just ok - they are far from friendly.  I've been in  a couple of times to pick up food and I have yet to be impressed.  I wanted to give them another chance tonight and I should not have bothered.  The food is not so good.  I'd rather go to Pita Jungle or Thai Llana any day!  The spring rolls are greasy and room temperature and the tofu is pretty nasty.  I had some kind of udon noodle dish and threw most of it in the garbage.  Use your 'free entree' coupon to save $$ one night, but that's about it... I will not be returning to (this) Pei Wei any time soon...I know, don't hate.....but I needed to find something inexpensive for dinner and asian sounded good.  My roomie said she liked this place so I thought I would give it a try.  I consider myself a connesour of good food. I love fancy restaurants with beautiful presentation.  But when you're short on funds you make do.  I have to say that I was not expecting much from Pei Wie.  Maybe that's not fair.  I walked in and was greeted warmly.  Since this was my first time the girl explained how to order.  I got the orange peel chicken and brown rice and an order of spring rolls.  I know this is not authentic asian food. But I will say this, it was hot and fresh and it was good.  The spring rolls were nice and crispy on the outside and cruncy on the inside.  The dipping sauce was good too.  My orange peel chicken had a little kick to it.  The veggies were cooked just right and the chicken was moist and tender.  And their ice tea was delish!  It went well with the meal.  Our server was attentive and brought us silverware and cleared everything when we were done.  The place was clean.  Even the area where the drink dispensers are was clean and sometimes that is an area that is just hard to keep clean.  I will go back to this Pei Wie and I will try others.  I think places like this can be hit or miss and that's why they get a bad rap.  But there is a niche for everything and this is one of those niche type places.  I liked it.  So sue me.  I also did not realize that Pei Wie is part of the P.F. Chang's francise.  I like P.F. Chang's too.  There I said it!  So, like Heather C. said......de-Elite me for eating at a place like this that's owed by a francise like that.
Poncho's Mexican Food=I call this... "Ode To The Only Resturant I Truely Love"My parents went to school with the owner's kids. They remember when it was a walk-up window take out place. Infact, when my father picked my mother and I up from the hospital after I was born, the FIRST stop they made on the way back to the rez was Poncho's! One of the co-owners likes to laugh and say that she saw me before most of my family did! I went from being in a car seat gurgling as my relatives chomped on the best chips in town served with some awesome hot sauce that hasn't really changed since I was young. To being a little girl who always ordered the deep friend tortilla wrapped hot dogs with crinkle cut french fries and the BEST coldest ketchup I ever had!! To being a young woman who brought every single close friend I met while being away at school or through the native pageant circuit to enjoy the wonders that is "The Works". My FAVORITE meal there is the cheese crisp as an appetizer, Combination #18 which is two tacos (i always order beef!), rice & beans. They have the best beans EVER!! And the rice is awesome too! I've had all the desserts on their menu and nothing really jumps out at me. I guess I still love the family tradition of going to the water & ice cream shop for thrifty ice cream before heading home! I have had many experiences at this resturant. I've held my high school graduation party there; this resturant was the place where I signed a contract that made me the goodwill ambassador of my people for nearly a year; it was from their bar that I had my first LEGAL margarita on my 21st birthday, it was also the place where my then boyfriend got on one knee and asked me to marry him, and it was their waitresses who said "to HELL with him!!" when we ended our engagement. It's a wonderful place to me, I like that I can go in and say "Hi Marty!" to their one time waitress who now manages the resturant. and have her yell, "HI CHERYL!!" Yes... that's right!! That's how long she has known me!! She can call me Cheryl and get away with it!! I also love the other long time co-owners/managers. There is one that always wants to buy a certain piece of jewelry off of me. And another who always laughes when I bring someone new in. Poncho's is a place of regulars... LONG time regulars. and i think this is what every great restuant needs. Local, long time regulars who grow with the restuant. Who bring in new friends to enjoy the huge wonderful chimichangas or the Presidential Special and laugh over delicious enchiladas while a secret service agent (who kinda looks like leslie nealson if u ask me) painted on the wall watches on. While a bustling resturant does what it does best: offer homestyled, friendly, affordable and great food to it's old time regulars and it's about-to-become regulars.Back in the day I used to drive all the way from Surprise to eat here, yes the food was that good. They used to have the most killer Pollo Fundido as well as amazing chunky salsa. Time has certainly changed this place.. we started with a cheese crisp with green chiles, delicious.. nice and crispy with just the right amount of chile strips.. also ordered their killer chunky salsa which was as good as I remember it. Then come my Pollo Fundido swimming, Im serious about this, swimming in a pool of grease!! They didn't even bother draining the thing before tossing it onto my plate. Was disgusting too, not even like clear oil but dark brown grease. Vile. Then the Misters Sampler showed up.. this thing was a fucking mess! You couldn't tell what was what under the piles of sauce and lettuce until you took a bite. Mini chimis were burnt, mini tacos burnt, tamales, cold and hard.. was a complete wreck. After a few bites we called it.. major loss of appetite.. a shame too cause the salsa was actually really good but the entrees were inedible. Meanwhile, the Mister was attached to the toilet within a few hours of eating here.. he was sick all day the next too.. so word of caution, eat here at your own risk.Im sure going to miss the good meals I used to have here, what a real shame.
Macayo's Mexican Restaurants=Walking into Macayo's is like entering a buffet restaurant in a Vegas casino. Tacky, tacky, tacky. Loud wall paper. Lots of different rooms. And the people. Oh, the people! Men in Hawaiian shirts or local team jerseys. Women with big hair and lots of screaming kids. Staff is usually quick to greet and really quite friendly. Standard Mexican fare is widely available. Stick to the combo platters and you may leave happy. The carnitas entree is a sad clump of dry pork...gee, I think that's the same thing my Uncle Larry said of his third ex wife. Anyhoo, the chile con queso is quite yummy and actually not on the menu. You have to ask for it. Served with a variety of blue, yellow and red corn chips, the dippin is fun and filling. The guacamole is pretty good although it seems there's a little filler in there therefore the avocado flavor suffers a bit. I really like the mini chicken chimichangas. The minis, not the regular sized. The latter are a bit tough and big and hard enough to use as a door stopper. Macayo's is a family owned, famous Phoenix restaurant landmark. The Central Ave. location happens to be in my hood and sometimes the convience outweighs the dee-lish factor. My recommendation is two shots of chilled Patron before the food and everything seems better. Hola and adios!Oh...Macayos.  A once Phoenix staple has turned into complete and utter crap.  I spent many a high school evenings dining here after debate practices and I believe El Presidente Obama ate here within the past few years.  Things have taken a big turn for the worse.  I mean, you shouldn't expect much with their cheesy decor and a customer base similar to that of Wal-Mart, but it used to be decent - and edible.  Their menu got smaller.  Its hard to find anything under $11.  The food (even the side of veggies) was SOOO greasy and fatty. Seriously - I feel like I need to eat salads for the next 2 days to compensate for the calorie content of that dish. The baja sauce lost its kick.  The guac had no flavor. I regret eating here.DOUBLE-X BLACKLIST. Three years since my last visit (not long enough apparently), and it's time I updated and upgraded Macayo's to DOUBLE-X. See you in 2014 beeyotches.Where oh where have your owners gone, Macayo's? What happened to the quality of food with which you opened and on which your franchise and brand name are founded?FIRE your kitchen staff, FIRE your kitchen manager, and FIRE your general manager.Mediocre, bland, sometimes scary, late, cold, not clean, goopy, old and stale.--cardboard menu cards are wet and starting to mildew from days and days of moisture;--salsa 4 to 5 days old. the salt has made it briney, the green chilis are fermenting it into vinegar;--special "top shelf" fresh-fruit texas margarita is a swirl of gatorade-colored syrup and a complete waste of grand marnier; head to Quick Trip instead;--rice from weeks ago, reheated, refrigerated, reheated, refrigerated, microwaved and then served from oblivion; dry, cakey gloopy SHIT. Shame on you!;--refried beans go the same way. ranch style. they keep for weeks out on the ranch. didn't finish them? no problem. just throw in a bit of lard and put 'em back on the fire. Macayo's clearly has the technique mastered.--chicken "guisado" so old, even cooks from Diamonds wouldn't serve it;--flour tortillas either not fully cooked, or kept in the same damp room as the menu cards -- they were doughy and starting to ferment;--sopapillas for shame! looked like fried cowpies. you couldn't force feed me this shit! SEND IT BACK!!!After dining at the mother restaurant, you can be sure I'll think twice when I see the Macayo bird on something at the grocery. BLECH.This is the Very first Macayo's. Always good food! We love the chips and salsa, especially with a good cup of coffee!The food is always good, we are not much of drinkers but, we hear the drinks are strong and good.You can order almost anything you want. Even if it is not on the menu. Their BaJA Sause is fantastic! Lots of really good choices. If you are craving Mexican this is the place.Since zero stars is not an option 1 shall do. One of the worst dinning experiences EVER!Me and my party of 4 sat down on a beautiful Saturday afternoon after the PRIDE festival just down the road. We sat and enjoyed the free chips and salsa and nothing else. After 25 minutes and ZERO service of a beverage or even an acknowledgement of our being there we decided to leave. If the place had been busy that would have been different but we were 1 of maybe 5 tables being used. Sad sad restaurant. Never again.
China Village=Nice Little FindFound this location based on fellow "yelpers" recommendation for egg drop soup and the yelpers were right, of course,  this egg drop soup could be the best in town. China Village has great lunch prices.   Seating is always  prompt, service quick and the staff is very personable.The food is good,the portions are big and the service is awesome. Food is always hot and ready fast.  If you go a couple times,they remember you.Really good place for a quick bite.
Hap's Pit Barbecue=This place serves the best BBQ within 5miles of the place I currently spend most of my billing hours.  Certainly better than the BBQ Company on 36th.I get the 2 meat combo which comes with a side (beans), chips (good chips), and 2 meats of your choice for like $7.50-$8.  I've tried and been impressed with the Pulled Pork, Brisket, and Smoked Ham.  Their meats have a very nice flvor and are served with just a tiny drizzle of bbq sauce, nothing more.  The flavor of the meats speak for themselves, you really don't need bbq sauce, but the drizzle is a nice compliment as opposed to being the main dish as it is at other, gross, bbq places.Service is quick, efficient, and very friendly.  They have a lot of micro-brew-ish sodas, fresh homemade deserts, and other yummy treats, if that's your thing.
Pat O'Malley's Jet Room=One of my favorite places in town for breakfast. It's quick (once you're seated).It's greasy (like breakfast from a skillet should be).It's no-nonsense (hash, taters, eggs).It's served with a smile (and usually some awesome conversation).Is it super local? Super sustainable?No.It's a diner. But a delicious one.And there are planes!"B-B-B-Bennie!" Sorry, couldn't resist. But really this place is great and deserves the shoutin'.Where else can you enjoy a yummy breakfast while watching planes land and take off?? Nowhere. Nowhere if not for Pat O Malley's. Nope.Anyways, as we were sipping on our coffees and enjoying the glorious views, we ordered:*Tenderloin steak and eggs with hashbrowns *Co-pilot - three egg omelet w. diced ham, american cheese & cheesy hashbrowns *Flight Attendant - three egg omelet w. fresh spinach, sauteed mushrooms, swiss cheese*The Yoke and Rudder - 2 sunny up eggs and baconAll the meals hit the spot. Delish. But Pat's also has tasty English muffins and BISCUITS!!!! (my current obsession)"B-B-B-Biscuits!" Yesssss
Wan Fu=I am one of  those people who loathe buffets and cheap Chinese "fast food". However, many of my friends and co-workers seem to love those types of joints, so I have reluctantly tried a lot of those little Chinese places tucked away in various shopping centers around town.  I want to find the exception to the rule and find one that I like, but I am always disappointed & never suprised. So, when I want to have good Chinese, I go to Wan Fu. I would have to say that it is most certainly my favorite Chinese restaurant in Charlotte. It has been here for about 22 years, and I think they have maintained the same consistency and quality from day 1.  Yes, it may be a little pricier than the typical little hole in the wall, but the portion size is big and the quality is excellent.And for recent transplants to Charlotte,  it may not be as good as the "super-authentic-ethnic places" that you can find in big cities with real Chinatown districts, but for this area, I think it offers the best quality and variety.   In any case, I can always find something here to make me happy.I love the traditional decor of the building - inside and out.  When you walk in it is a little dark, but I like the ambiance.  I have been here with small groups here as well as with large groups, and the service is equally good either way. They try to be very attentive,  making sure your order has been taken and that your glass is always filled and I appreciate their efforts. But I think the key to why I really like this place so much is that every time I have eaten here, my food tastes as if they have used quality, fresh ingredients and that the food was cooked just right. (Chicken is light & sauteed to perfection - not overcooked and rubbery, and the veggies are not overcooked either.)  Over the many years that I have been going to Wan Fu,  I have never had a bad meal here. I am not a fan of fried rice in general, but once I had their pineapple fried rice with chicken - and it was pretty amazing.  It is nothing like that pathetic excuse for fried rice that you get served at cheaper Chinese places!  I love all of the typical stir fry dishes here - the Cashew Chicken,  Kung Pao Chicken, General Tao Chicken, Firecracker Shrimp, etc.  Of course, I normally go with brown rice and you can choose a chicken & shrimp spring roll or a veggie spring roll.I have been many times for take out too - with their easy drive up window, its a no-brainer!After many years of going to Wan Fu, I think the quality is still just as good as on my first visit.  Today I did not eat in but called to place a takeout order at lunch time. My order was ready within 15 minutes.The lunch menu is a great value..  I got Kung Pao chicken ($8.25) with brown rice. They will sub the brown rice instead of white rice at no additional charge. Also, the lunch entrée comes with a veggie spring roll. However if you ask for spring roll with shrimp & chicken, they don't up charge for that either.They use fresh veggies and good cuts of chicken unlike most places in those strip shopping centers. Also, I never have that icky feeling I get when I eat at a place that uses too much MSG in their food.Wan Fu, keep doing what you're doing and you will remain my favorite Chinese restaurant in Charlotte!
Loving Hut=Since The Veggie House turned into Loving Hut, I have been twice, and am very delighted at some of the positive changes that have occurred.The space itself is much lighter, and I feel more welcome by the staff. I also like that their food selection is WAY less greasy and has more of a focus on health.I have tried the spicy cha cha twice (it is actually yam protein breaded to look like shrimp) and it is FANTASTIC. I have also had the raw salad, sweet and sour pork, fried rice, one of the noodle soups, and the stuffed tomatoes. All were good, but the stuffed tomatoes could have used a little more flavor. Great portion sizes.They do not serve alcohol, but have some really fun concoctions to drink. Try the "Pink Lady" or the delightful "Sunny Forest."I went into this place weirdly expecting Pauly Shore to pop out exclaiming, "Welcome tuu the LUuving HuUt"  Please God no. When this was Supreme Master I knew I was in for a long wait and this is still the case, a party had to get their own menus they grew too impatient. Don't expect to be out of here in 45 minutes or under an hour for that matter.Vegetarian meals shouldn't be this hard to find and they are not, this is just another option to consider if you are on this side of town. I have found some items on the menu I can cross off, and some I will always make my regular rotation. Service is friendly but be sure to snatch your desserts before you hit the table, otherwise they will be gone by the time you finish your meal. Cheesecake is very popular and is frequently sold out. Just thought you should know that, before the vultures swarm.The Heaven Rice Rolls $4.00 are okay if you are a fan of the rice paper wrapping, although I did not like the cold, rubbery, not too flavorful texture. The peanut sauce was a compliment to every dish however, and could go on anything (it is supposed to come with a hoisin sauce). The Moo Shu Vegetables $6.95 came differently than how they are supposed to on the menu, it came wrapped tightly again with a rice paper instead of in a wheat Moo Shu skin. Not acceptable.The Sweet and Sour Divine $8.50 (rice separately white $1.00, brown $1.25) was delicious, a true vegan "junk food" delight. Soy protein, pineapple, carrots, and homemade S&S sauce which I thought they gave me a little too much of but that's okay. It looked like real chicken, tasted like real chicken, and although I have been a vegetarian for 8 years, it was reminiscent of the real thing and recreated that memory for me of eating some S&S Chicken. My mom who is not in anyway shape or form a vegan, was shocked by the taste of the dish (she was a butcher for many years).The Guru Curry $7.50 is made like a thin Thai curry so don't expect a thick Indian or Chinese curry. It is soupy but it is very good and is served with a crusty loaf of bread. It is composed of: curry, taro, carrots, potatoes, gluten, tofu.The small trick she offered us about their water is that they cut up a bunch of oranges and put it in the ice water. The Macadamia Carrot Cake $3.95 could have been better if it wasn't so dried out by the refrigerator. It was a delicious cake but they need to throw those out and replace them. With: coconut, carrots, turbinado, sugar, macadamia nuts, spices, coconut cream topping.Please men in the back who kept farting; I know vegans have a lot of fiber running through the digestive tract at an astronomical rate but farting in a full restaurant is in poor taste. Please excuse yourself and go to the bathroom and fart to your heart's content or take it outside. *Disclaimer-none of the people pictured were the purveyors of the gas.All items are 100% vegan, all entrees are under $10, all of their delicious organic juices, milks and teas are $3.50-5.00.  It gets busy on weekends and with the already long wait, prepare to wait or come early.Might be hard to pass up but it is right across from Chuy's, and right in the same parking lot as Desert Jade.
Fate 905=Stay away. Far away.I had been hearing about Fate for a while. I had high expectations, since I had been to Lucky Dragon in the past (the owners prev joint) which was OK.It was the worst Chinese/Asian I've had in AZ, the service was terrible, the chairs uncomfortable, and to top it off my fiancee got food poisoning.... and has been sick for the last 2 days from it. I took her to the ER this morning at 4:30 AM and decided to finally start posting on Yelp since I've been a lurker for a while.Aesthetics:Initially looks like a typical hipster restaurant like you might find in another city. Nice patio, cool inside.  However... The seating at a bus stop is more comfy. There is no chair back - just this high bar thing that digs into your back.I'm going to file this under aesthetics - we ordered the Hot and Sour soup (more on that later) and the waitress suggested it was large enough to share. However, they apparently don't have any kind of serving utensil, so we had to use our little soup spoons to serve ourself soup into another bowl out of this wide shallow terrine. WTF?Service:I don't know a nicer way to say it, our waitress was a dopey bimbo. It took 20 minutes for her to take our order. She went missing for long periods of time when I had an empty water glass, and then for a while longer after I tracked her down and asked for some. Not good.Food:I ran into a friend there, and he commented at how he loved the food and was surprised we didn't like it. To be blunt, it was utter crap. The hot and sour soup was thin and spicy. That's it. It tasted like chiles and a splash of rice wine vinegar- no other flavors present. It's not like any hot and sour soup I ever had.... in a bad way. There are these weird chewy dumplings like things in it that would be better served at protecting the floor from your chair leg. I ordered some Saigon basil something or other dish with beef, she ordered the Lemon Grass whatever with tofu.My dish was bad. The beef was sliced thin but tough and chewy, and totally lacked flavor. As for basil, there were 2 small basil leaves in the dish, and that's it. The sauce was thin and one dimensional. Her lemon grass dish was also bad. The sauce tasted like Tom Yum paste from the chinese grocery store mixed with some water. I felt bad for the poor abused tofu.I'm not a big fan of chain restaurants.... but Pei Wei and Pickup Sticks are about 10x better in terms of food quality and taste. Screw that, even the chinese place in the mall food court is better. I am not exaggerating. It was a very disappointing meal.Now for the nasty part.I drank water - Fiancee unit drank th 'Green Tea.' It was like no other green tea I ever had seen. It was leprechaun green, with some kind of milk like substance in it.I thought it looked kinda funky, but she drank it.It was the only difference between our meals. I tried hers, she tried mine, etc. I didn't drink the science experiment tea.Well... Several hours later she started having stabbing stomach pains. She spent the whole night up vomiting and with diarrhea.  2 days later the vomiting has subsided but she's missed 2 days of school and is still pooping up a storm. I took her to the ER at 4:30 AM this morning and they confirmed the symptoms were consistent with food poisoning. Admittedly she had just gotten back a 45 days ago from a trip to a 3rd world country where she got (and recovered from) a tropical disease so her immune system is not at it's strongest right now, but come on. This shouldn't be the end result. Plus this IS downtown Phoenix so there are plenty of people around with compromised immune systems, if you know what I mean, due to lifestyle choices.There is some great Asian food in Central Phoenix. Maxim and Da Vang are great Vietnamese places on 19th ave.The Cultural Center has a few great places, esp Golden Buddha. Thai Lahna has been consistently good for years.Like I said I don't eat a lot of chain food - but even the Pei Wei at 7th ave and McDowell is way better in terms of food quality.I really enjoy the atmosphere however the food is worse than a microwave dinner. I think the buy bing bags of stirfry from costco!!We got there and they didnt seat us for 30mins. When there were tables. Then we got seated and didnt get the food for 1 and a half hours. We kept trying to grab the witress but she would avoid us. Then we would ask othe waitresses and they said the would check.People were coming and going that got there after us!!!Finally I got aggressive with our waitress and we saw her walk to the chef and put in our order!!!She forgot to put in our order!!!Since she wanted to pretend like it was just taking a long time she fucked the whole order up because she was going off memory and couldnt ask us because then we would know.The food came finally and it was all crap we didnt even order!!!We told her to forget the whole thing we are leaving and not paying.She grabbed her manager who told us. "she is on thin ice with the owner who is right there. I can take it off the bill but there is a good chance we will get her fired. Or the waitress will pay for half out of her pocket"WTF!!!!!!!!!!!Of course I told her the whole meal needs to be free and it was extremely unprofessional that she would blame a waitress getting fired because we waited a total of 2 hrs for the wrong meals we didnt eat!!It would have been rated a zero star but I gave it 2 because now they are a bar too and that portion is pretty cool.
Los Taquitos=What I was thinking on the way to los taquitos:"I hate that Guy Fieri.  What a jerk.  First of all, he pronounces his last name all Italian, and I am 100% certain that he pronounced it like a full on american all his life until he made it on Food Network.  Then, he gets to drive around and taste greasy food all day.  Plus, he looks high as a kite sometimes on air, which probably makes the food even better.  Anywhere from 1-4 reasons to be jealous/annoyed with the guy, depending on who you are."Also:"I wish God would smite Beyonce.  Her songs are the most annoying songs I've ever heard.  If there were a way for her to get smacked into permanent silence, I'd be all for it."And:"I can't wait to eat at this place.  Street tacos sound delish.  Where is it?  Wait--this looks like a residential neighborhood.  Where the hell am I?"Ultimately I find the place and go in.  There's some floozy outside with a huge rack--only pertinent because she ended up being an employee.  Well I guess it isn't really pertinent then, either.Anyway, I'm *wanting* to like this place.  I long to be able to say that I went to a place today and ate food that tasted like pureed happiness.  I want to give this place five stars and brag right and left that this is the place to be.But I don't.  The service was good--the girl was nice (bc of an earlier review I was expecting the worst) and she told me the street tacos were the way to go.  I got the three tacos, one chicken, one carnitas, one steak (asada).  Plus rice and beans.  On corn tortillas.  And I got a sexy-looking bottle of coke.When the food came out, I was devastated.  Where my three tacos should have been, I had three walniut-sized excuses for tacos.  Where my beans covered in mexican cheese should have been, I got beans covered in an afterthought of some white cheese (which isn't what I wanted.  Sue me).  Where my rice should have been there was rice.  1 for 3.The street tacos all tasted ostensibly the same.  That punk Guy Fieri on Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives on Food Network made it sound like I'd wet myself with glee upon eating the carnitas, and the lady making the batch acted like they'd be good enough to keep part of the recipe a secret.  They aren't.  That recipe should be open source for sure, so that maybe someone can come along and improve it.  I certainly could.Anyway--maybe it was because he was high as a f*&^ing kite but the food did not taste like magic, it tasted like hot sauce.  And I am all for hot sauce--I'll bitchslap a habanero or two, no problem.  But the issue is that whatever I ate, it tasted like only the hot sauce.  I added green sauce--still the same flavor.  I wanted to be wowed, but instead I thought, "Meh.  I've experienced better."  Which is why you see two stars here.In fact, I don't blame Los Taquitos for doing what they do.  Whatever is fine by me.  But now I kinda wanna slew-foot Guy Fieri just that little bit more for telling me that this place was so good.  If you're gonna tell the world what's delicious, don't smoke out first, because I've been there and eaten a piece of my cat's litter and it tasted pretty decent to me at the time.  Hardly a reliable indicator of a culinary masterpiece.A couple of disclaimers: I don't hate Guy, I have no idea if he smokes out, I'm not judging him or you, stoner.  But I am judging that very average set of tacos.I recently met with the lovely Georgie S. for lunch at good ol Los Taquitos. I am absolutely certain that I gained no less than seven pounds in this sitting between the bean & cheese with Pico De Gallo burrito and the Chile Relleno. Yeah, that is right, I ordered and ate two full meals. What can I say; I like good food. Especially Mexican food. Little shop (Probably 10-15 tables) conveniently sandwiched in between Walgreen's and Safeway so you don't end up shopping on an empty stomach. That could be really dangerous. Cheap. Filling. Fattening. Yummy.My coworkers go to Los Taquitos for the women, I go to Los Taquitos for the tacos. Specifically, the hard shell tacos. They are literally the best hard shell tacos I have ever had in my entire life. Carne asada, chicken, fish, it doesn't matter, they're all delicious and incredibly flavorful.There is nothing glamorous at all about this place. Strip mall location, plastic tables and silverware, whole nine yards.  That said, the food really is fantastic and the price is right. I usually get out of there at lunch somewhere between $6-$8 and I aint mad at that.Just do yourself a favor and don't go during the week their episode airs on Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives on the Food Network as the line is out the door.My g-chat status has been set to "Los Taquitos FTW!" for about three weeks now. No, not because I am too lazy to change it, because I pretty much eat Los Taquitos every single day. If you are a follower of mine, you have probably learned by now that I have an obsessive personality, especially when it comes to food. The problem is, it is SO good here I JUST CANNOT STOP.I cannot eat the a-la-carte Chile Relleno anymore (not vegan), but it is so freaking good and I really wish I could. My friend recently got it in burrito form and I think it was true love.Dallas G. loves the bean burrito with a little guac on the side. There is something about their beans that make you salivate just thinking about them.But, here is what just makes my soul sing: The three hard taco combo. I get it with beans (no meat) and no cheese, and add pico. I get all beans with no cheese on the side. I lather that ish up with the green sauce, and suddenly all is right in the world.The clock just struck 8:30am... guess what that means? That's Right! TACO TIME!can we have a moment of silence for the carnitas street tacos?let's pay our respect for the carne asada. what is the secret ingredient in those beans?? i can't pin point it but those beans are something else. we wanted to try it all, so naturally, it was the 3 item combo platter: 1 taco, 1 tamale, 1 enchilada. the friendliest girl told us they were known for street tacos and we should have listened. everything on the plate was great but it was all about that taco. i thought i knew delicious but it reached a whole 'notha level after eating here. my recommendation: street taco combo plate w carne asada and DEFINITELY carnitas. then drizzle on some of that green salsa they have. welcome to bliss.they are a tad inconsistent but it's still really good, some days are just off the charts goods.One bite and I was transported back to the crowded streets of Monterrey.  I could almost smell the exhaust of the vochos and hear the distant conversation of the local policia extorting their prescribed mordida.  Quite simply, this is the taco as the way it was intended by its creators.  The pure and unadulterated classic enjoyed by the Mexican working class.What Pomo is to pizza, this place is to tacos.  Authentic...absolutely authentic.I've been wanting to try Los Taquitos even before I knew it had been on Diners, Drive-ins and Dives and I finally got the chance.  The inside it exactly what I expected, nothing fancy, booths and some tables.  I found it a little odd that the counter where you order is so small and the drink lids, napkins, condiments and plasticware are right next to it.  If there had been a line it would have been very awkward.  I ordered a chicken burrito, enchilada style with rice and beans and a drink.  When I went to get my drink they were out of Diet Coke, it came out as just water.  Ok, I thought maybe they had been super busy as it was about 1pm on a weekday.  Lunch rush perhaps.  I took a seat and waited for my number to be called.  The burrito was good, nothing that knocked my socks off but a decent burrito.  The rice was nice and fluffly but the beans just lacked flavor.  They were blah.  Will I come back?  Sure but I will try the tacos next time and hope that they can rearrange that counter a bit.This is a great hole in the wall family owned Mexican restaurant. I have not had a bad thing on the menu. Their street tacos are some of the best. You can choose the type of meat you want in them. You can even get all three in the combo different. The Torta is awesome and the burritos are mouth watering.Service is great. It gets a little cramped waiting for your order because the place is really that small. The prices are good too. Sure there isn't a dollar menu but who needs one when the food is this good. Dollar menus are for places with horrible food.It can get packed around lunch time so be warned. Calling you order in will save on time if you only have an hour for lunch.I have been going here for years and will keep coming back.While visiting Arizona some co-workers of mine were recommending places to eat when the name Los Taquitos came up. With Mexican food being one of my favorite types of ethnic eats I knew while in the area I would definitely have to give this place a try and I'm glad I did.Situated in a safe and standard strip mall sits this spectacular site sure to satisfy your stomach. I walked in to see some very nice art of what appeared to be Santa Muerte or some other skeletons on the wall and placed my order. Per a recommendation from a co-worker I ordered the "bombero pollo".  Once my order was ready it was time to head back to my office and consume this.The bombero pollo was a chicken burrito with some hot sauce and cheese on the outside, I also got beans and rice with it. To start with the entree the hot sauce on the outside really gives this a lot of its flavor. It's fairly hot and I was warned ahead of time, but I'm no chicken, I merely eat chickens, on a burrito. The chicken and other ingridients were good, a little watery. Overall I was very impressed with the bombero pollo as the hot sauce was a great compliment.The rice and beans left a little to be desired. These tasted worse than the ones I get at my local Mexican restaurant in suburban Chicago. I'm willing to take a stab in the dark and guess they were frozen and thawed out due to the somewhat bunchy and odd consistency of bean dip. That's not to say they were bad, just not ideal or on par with what I've had other places.Overall, I really liked the Bombero Pollo, the hot sauce gives it a fantastic flavor. I'm a big fan of Mexican food and this place was fantastic and I would highly recommend it if you happen to be in Phoenix looking for some caliente lunch or dinner. Cinco stars for Los Taquitos.Top-notch Mexican food from an unassuming storefront in an otherwise generic shopping center.  I was turned on to Los Taquitos by a friend who, despite certain dietary restrictions, will indulge in the tacos here when she needs her street food fix.  Coming from California, I have been mystified and befuddled by the lack of good, cheap Mom-and-Pop Mexican food joints in the Phoenix Metro Area.  It seems that when I have gone out exploring, I have been completely disappointed with bland, underseasoned, cafteria-style Mexican food that seems to be de rigeur in these parts.  This is not the case with Los Taquitos.The food here is a tremendous value.  You spend no more than you would at any other Mexican food hole-in-the-wall, but the flavor and attention to texture and food preparation is exceptional.  The hard-shell tacos have the proper jaw-rattling crunch, and the meat is well-seasoned and tasty.  They don't require too much hot sauce because they are so savory on their own, but the house-made green and red sauce condiments, add the perfect amount of heat and brightness.  I have also sampled the carne asada burrito, served enchilada-style (i.e., smothered in red simmer sauce), and found it to be spot-on as far as texture and taste.  The flour tortilla is soft and sturdy, whereas the beef is toothsome and appropriately salty and spicy.I fear that I have been ruined for all other quick-and-dirty Mexican food joints after eating here.  Los Taquitos sets the bar very high for this niche of restaurant, and the service is prompt despite the crowds of loyal patrons that jam-pack themselves into this small little place for a taste of spicy, savory, satisfying Mexican food heaven.I'm still trying to figure out how I lived seven-ish years in Ahwatukee, and somehow missed out on Los Taquitos! Came here a few weeks back with Yelpers Monica O., Cheryl B., Shannon E. and Rick N. for a lovely workday lunch. If it's your first visit, you absolutely MUST try the infamous street tacos. My first go, I tried the Carne Asada, Pollo, and Fish three taco meal with rice and beans. They were all delicious, but the Carne Asada was the star. Some of the best I've had in a long time. The spices worked well together, and no tough pieces were to be found. The Red Salsa they top everything with is nothing short of amazing. It's not blazing hot, but tastes great. I enjoyed it so much I dragged my Dude back out a Saturday that same week, where we discovered the Carnitas are right up there with the Carne Asada! Very tender, and it tasted like some type of apple and brown sugar rub was used. And again for another workday lunch when I got stuck on a client call and missed a vendor provided lunch.This place is small and gets packed at high noon quickly.Call it a dive; call it a dump. If you're coming here for ambiance (not delicious tacos), you're doing it wrong!I look forward to trying other menu offerings at Los Taquitos, but for now, I'm hung up on those amazing street tacos.Update 9/18: Tried the Bombero Burrito con Pollo. Do not order this if you hate spicy; also, it's massive (see photos) so SHARE. Barely ate half! Was able to sample the Vegetarian tacos, also delicious.I really wanted to like this place : (Hubby had tacos (lengua, asada y pastor) and he said they were the best tacos ever.I did not have any because the extra taco I had ordered for myself... was not actually in my order, so disappointment number one.Service was OK but not particularly friendly.2 - We ordered, sat to wait for our number, and people were coming and going... they seem to pay more attention to people with to go orders than to the customers in their dining room, which is a big turn off for me as a customer. Even a person in a neighboring table made conversation and asked what we had ordered, because he thought we were waiting for a while. Hubby got impatient and went to ask (they were like 10 numbers over our ticket number) and he was told the delay was because of our 'big' order... yeah, 3 tacos, a bowl of menudo and a drink.Well, the menudo was super hot... (are there any regulations about food temperature?  hehe) and in fact very tasty, but super stingy with the meat, I think they were leftovers and honestly they should have said 'we run out' instead of selling me a bowl of hominy. Well, I would have taken it at a discount, but not for regular price.So, it would have been great if it was a regular portion, but it was like 90% hominy, 10% pancita, so that is a big no-no in my book.We don't live anywhere close to this place, so I do not see ourselves coming back. Unless hubby really craves those awesome tacos one of these days.
Pane Bianco=I just love being the rebel sometimes. You know, like Fonzie. With friends named Pinky and Leather. Hey,  aren't those the bartenders names at Padlock (or whatever the heck it's called now)? My first Pane Bianco sandwich was consumed just seconds ago. The creamy, uber fresh mozzarella is still dripping down my face. The house baked focaccia, crisp and chewy in  all the right places. And loaded with fresh basil, bursting with flavor. The tomatoes, well, the tomatoes were OK. So why am I just satisfied instead of my eyes rolling back into my head and my toes curling up, like when I eat ice cream in bed? I give the sandwich, for me, 3 stars. Not because it's not fantastic. I guess I just tire of eating mozzarella. The texture gets funky to me. But, this place is amazing. And I will go back. But the rebel in me must tell you what WAS 5 stars today. Julie's organic Carolina gold rice pudding.  I'm sitting in a tub right now. Go get some. Oh, I'm sorry, you can't. I got the last one!!!I of course have a crush on Chris Bianco. Not because of his rugged good looks or what could be hiding behind his fly but because of his ideals and passions. He is committed to the finest ingredients.. the best techniques and has the knowledge to pull it all together almost daily with consistency. I admire what he does and it simply shows in all that he makes. PB for me is hands down the best place in town for a great rustic sandwich. The flavors and textures are simple yet when combined offer a complexity that's hard to beat. Down to earth this place directly reflects the passion of it's owner. Chris Bianco should run for president.. no bs.. no lying about WMD.. just true and real, honest to goodness.The best sandwich I've ever had is hands down Chris Bianco's amazing housemade mozzarella, local tomato and basil sandwich. All his sandwiches are delivered on amazing pane (Italian bread) with ingredients of the highest quality - as at Pizzeria Bianco. If I stop by with less hunger I usually go for the house made focaccia, the pieces are large enough to practically be considered a slice of deep dish pizza. They're topped with a different combination daily and are heated in the wood fired oven before being wrapped up - it's amazing for half the price of the sandwich.Be warned that seating is only outdoors, but the tables are covered by shade with water misters. So depending on the weather this usually isn't that big of a deal. And if you are really brave you may venture next door into Lux for a cool drink and an escape from the outdoor tables.This is a wonderful spot for a casual lunch or for bringing people from out of town. The lines are not nearly as long as they are at Pizzeria Bianco.... yet.Oh Pane Bianco....your little caramel cremes at the bottom of the bag knock you up to a 4 star review.  I love caramel cremes, but really l am at a 3.5 with you.  Honestly, I would go down to a 3 but...those caramels save you.I'll be real.  The sandwiches are good.  Best mozzarella I've ever had? No.  (The Italian deli in the town my parents live in has amazing mozzarella) Best caprese sandwich I've ever had? No.  (Oh Oxford Spa...how I miss you so.....your Thesis is so yummy...)   Best caprese sandwich in the Valley? Perhaps.  I was not impressed with the bread by any means....there was nothing truly stellar about it.  And I found the soprasetta to be very salty.  I know Italian meats can sometimes be salty but this was a little much.The extremely limited menu and the fact they aren't open on Mondays takes a star off right there.  The space is kind of barren.  I'm used to Italian sandwich shops being light, airy, welcoming and warm places.  Pane Bianco was kind of like a sandwich factory.  They have a very limited grocery section which just seemed to me to be for show.  "Let's throw in this grocery section to make it look like an Italian market!"    I don't think the price they charge is justifiable.  I don't know...where I'm from there are plenty of sandwich shops where you can get just as good, if not better, of a sandwich (from a much larger selection) AND a drink AND a bag of chips (or salad if you want) for the same price.  At least you do get those caramels...I want to hate you, Pane Bianco. I really really want to hate you. With every fabulous fiber in my being.You have weird hours, an overwhelming "not quite industrial, not quite rustic" decor, and your $8 Mozzarella, Tomato and Basil salad consists of a cut up tomato and a few, uh, "slugs" of mozzarella topped with soggy basil leaves. But the real reason I want to hate you is that you duped me. You bamboozled, shanghaied and probably even Kansas City Shuffled me too.You lured me into this false sense of disappointment with my tiny salad and loaf of bread rolled up in a piece of paper.You watched me eat it too, didn't you?You saw me take a big chunk out of one of those cheese slugs. You watched me enjoying that salad. That delicious, gooey salad.And you liked it, didn't you? You liked watching me scarf down that salad like it was an item from a value menu. You got a sick kick out of seeing me tear through that bread like I'd never had it so good. You bastard.I want to hate you. I want to give you two stars and rant and rave about how you teh lame.But I can't. I just can't. That salad was just, like, whoa. That had to be the freshest mozzarella and the freshest tomatoes I'd ever tasted.It made olive garden salad taste like bagged lettuce doused in olive oil.And if Subway made bread as fresh as yours, I would stop going in there periodically to order the seafood sensation (toasted!) just to watch the employees and other patrons moan and cringe. I want to hate you. But that bait and switch, luring me in with that "too cool for you" vibe and then hitting me up with some flava, that takes skill. That takes cunning.And as a woman who spent her youth tying bedsheets around her neck and trying to burn the neighbor's house down with her mind, I appreciate cunning.Four stars for being cunning, and one star for being leaps and bounds of awesome ahead of Lux. I don't care if it's vegan. It's still a cupcake, you're still a grown up, and eating it while surfing the web on your flashy new laptop does not make you look any less ridiculous.The 5 Stars let you know where I stand. Uniquely awesome sammiches on crazy fresh Umbrian-style bread. You cannot go wrong.So just a tip:keep calling and checking to see if one of the following is the market sammich that day. - crumbled sausage and melted mozzarella - pulled pork - pulled lamb If it is one of the above, in that order, drop whatever you're doing and get there as fast as you can. Also, do not ignore the market focaccia. Even if it just looks like a pile of veggies on a sheet pan pizza, it is fantastic.I am not on the Chris Bianco bandwagon. I think his pizza is ok, but not nearly worth an hour wait, let alone the 3 to 4 hour actual wait. But one thing that MF can make better than anyone else is fresh mozzarella. I love mozzarella.So, without the wait, I can head to Pane Bianco and get a mozzarella sandwich with fresh basil and tomatoes on Bianco's fresh baked bread (it all sounds very fresh).Don't ask me about any other sandwich because I don't know. Nor do I care. Fresh mozzarella. Some people talk about the goat cheese sandwich. Who cares? Fresh mozzarella!Most people think of pizza when they hear Chris Bianco. All I can think of is fresh mozzarella.As any normal person would when trying a place that has 4.5 stars based on 70 reviews (and that just *happens* to be related to the notorious Pizzeria Bianco, where people wait hours upon hours for pizza), I had very high expectations for Pane Bianco. I expected to bite into my sandwich and be wowed. While I really enjoyed the mozzarella and soppressata sandwiches we split and certainly found them both more enjoyable than many sandwiches I have had in the Phoenix area, I just don't think this place is deserving of the Salvation Army of fans that seems to be willing to fight a holy war for that mozzarella sandwich. In my eyes, what makes Pane Bianco's sandwiches good (and still worthy of 3 stars) is the fact that they are simple. Unlike some yuppy establishments where Arcadia ladies "lunch" (think Wildflower, Acacia Cafe or Chelsea's Kitchen), Pane Bianco (and by the transitive property, Chris Bianco) clearly has the European sensibility of "less is more." A sandwich doesn't need to be piled high with garlic aioli, carmelized onions, and herb goat cheese to be good. If the ingredients are high enough quality, the bread and a few fillings should be able to stand alone and make for a great sandwich. I guess that's where my problem with Pane Bianco comes in. The individual ingredients of the sandwiches just weren't that great. Certainly, the mozzarella is good but I have had better mozzarella from nice local grocery stores and of course, at countless Italian places. I also agree with Kristin S that the soppressata was overly salty, which obscured the flavor. Finally, I didn't think the bread was as delicious as I had pictured it would be many times before actually coming. It certainly tasted fresh but I thought it could have a bit more flavor complexity (as it was, it tasted very white-bread and didn't have the slightly sour kick that housmade bread often does. I've got to be honest that after trying Pane Bianco, I am convinced that I would be a bit disappointed if I waited in line to eat at PIzzeria Bianco. While I can definitely appreciate a simple but delicious Pizza Margherita in a world where buffalo chicken pizza is somehow an appealing dish, the individual pizza ingredients would have to be better than the ones at Pane Bianco for me to truly feel like the wait was worth it.If Pizzeria Bianco is so ballyhooed about that it has an almost mythic status... then Pane Bianco could almost be seen as the less famous step-child of the family. Here is an analogy for you... I hope you remember how these work from your high school days:Alec Baldwin is to Stephen Baldwin as Pizzeria Bianco is to ______?...how did you do? If you filled in the blank with "Pane Bianco", then congratulations... give yourself a pat on the back and 3 extra credit points. Just a hop, skip and a jump north of downtown Phoenix lies this little unassuming storefront. If you didn't know any better, you'd never guess that some of tastiest sandwiches in the valley are being cooked up inside. Similar to Pizzeria Bianco, there is a focus on fresh local ingredients and simplicity. Don't expect a dazzling and varied menu, but do expect a small selection of sandwiches which they really know how to cook well. I always love it when a place has a small menu of things that they do great, rather than an extensive menu of things they do just OK. Last time we went, we were able to get one of each sandwich on the menu (it's not as impressive as it sounds... they only have three sandwiches along with one rotating special). Each one had unique flavor and tasted really fresh.... our favorite might be the simplest one they have; the mozzarella/tomato/basil sandwich... yum yum. They have a way of always cooking the bread perfectly, so it has this slightly burnt crisp to it; it's almost like you're eating a sandwich made out of really good pizza crust.There's really not too much bad to say about this place, they serve great fresh sandwiches for a pretty reasonable price. If you do go though, there is occasionally a little bit of a wait... and it's strictly a 'to-go' place, so there's no indoor seating (there are picnic tables outside in the front). If you do have a little wait time to get your food, be sure to go next door to Lux where you can get a pretty good cup of coffee/tea and laugh at the sheer volume of trendy hipsters completely enamored in their MacBooks. 4.25/5.I forgot to review my birthday lunch......damn it anyways! I wanted to try some of Mr. Biancos offerings but did not want to wait 3 hours for pizza so we decided to come here.I figured it would be my only trip here in quite some time so I decided to get 2 sandwiches.  I got the tomato, basil and mozarella.  And I also got the sopresetta and provlone with roasted peppers. The sopresetta was one of the top 5 sandwiches I have ever had.  It was absolutely perfect.  Not a whole lot of meat, but the flavor was super delicious!  The roasted red peppers and sharp provolone blended well and it was on some amazing bread.  Basically pizza crust.  SO GOOD!The tomato sandwich was meh.  Im not the biggest fan of tomatos to begin with and when I tried I bite I knew why ;-).  I picked them out and basically ate a mozarella sandwich.  This one got a little soggy too. About 8 bucks each which was ok by me.  The candy they give you in the bag is a super small caramel.  It was good, but nothing to rave about.  One bite and it was dust.  If I ever come back to Phoenix I will definitley stop by and get a sopresetta sandwich.  It was amazing!I am bumping this up to 5 stars.  My buddy and I came here 2 days in a row for lunch.  I got the sopresetta sandwich each time and I found a new appreciation for it.  It is so darn simple, yet so damn tasty.  The mix of the slightly greasy/salty meat, combined with the flavor of the roasted red peppers and sharp....almost hard.....provolone cheese, stuffed in between that delicious bread they use=in my top 5 favorite sandwiches EVER!Totally expect to get my ass kicked by the serious Pane Bianco devotees on here, but oh well. Meh. I don't like paying $10+ for a sandwich, and then almost $4 for a side, and $2-3 for a bottle of water/bottle of soda. That is not an acceptable lunch option to me. Especially when I have yet to patron Pane Bianco one time and not been hungry an hour later. This is the freakin' sushi bar of the sandwich world.While I'll agree that the ingredients are fresh, you get so few of them it would be difficult to know otherwise. I've been several times now and pretty much always get the tomato/mozz sandwich as I don't eat tuna salad or have a taste for sopressatta. The other day however I got the market sandwich and I was so excited to be able to try something new because it had turkey in it. 2 whole super thin supermarket looking slices of turkey. Mmmmmm. Delicious giant pieces of bread with two super thin slices of turkey in the middle. How could I say anything nasty about paying $10 for you? How dare I be hungry an hour later when you made me so full with all of that bread? You get the picture. Stick the the tomato/mozz sandwich if you're heading this way. Oh, and make sure someone else is picking up this ludicrous tab.Yay dinner!!!It's no big secret that I'm a huge fan of Chris Bianco. His simple honest to goodness approach to food is not only inspiring but down right delicious. If you're one of his fans who don't mind waiting 4 hours for one of his amazing pies at Pizzeria Bianco, then you're in for a real treat. While they don't serve pizza, one of my all time favorites, Pane Bianco is now serving dinner and no serious wait either! In addition to ordering one of their famous sandwiches, you can expect an ever changing menu of rustic Italian inspired plates.If you've been to Pane you know the drill, go in, order at the counter then either decide to take your score home, or eat there on one of the communal outdoor tables. No wine or beer is served at this time but there is talk of Pane expanding into the Lux Coffee space next door which will eventually offer inside seating and hopefully wine by the glass. If all of this goes down, Lux will simply move to the adjacent building also getting a larger space. For me Bianco's food just screams for a glassed of red wine.Ordering the Crespelle ($12) had me really excited due to the unique nature of the dish itself. Basically an Italian crepe made the garbanzo bean flour; it's filled with luscious ricotta cheese, hints of spinach then bathed in a slightly sweet tomato sauce. It was clear that after the first bite I was in love with this dish, I simply couldn't stop though glares from my dining companions made me to relinquish the plate. I can't sing enough praises for Biancos Housemade Mozzarella ($8), thick slabs of hand pulled cheese is paired with fresh tomatoes, a few leaves of basil, olive oil and a sprinkling of salt, that's it. The resulting texture and flavor is so toothsome and fresh that I've yet to have another as good. The salad comes with bread which I put to good use soaking up every drop of the salads milky elixir. Served on house made flat bread, the Soppressata with Aged Provolone ($8) which also comes topped with a healthy shave of Parmesan cheese and slices of roasted onion. The pungency from the provolone is a nice compliment to the pork-tastic slices of soppressata. Bianco is dedicated to local purveyors and for good reason, they make some of the best Phoenix has to offer. Take the Sausage with beluga lentils and polenta ($10) for instance. The sausage comes from our very own Schreiner's Fine Sausages over on 7th Street and let me just say, this plump link had just the right amount of meaty well seasoned punch to compliment the hearty lentils and super moist polenta cake.If you're more of a lighter eater, I'd suggest the highly flavorful Roasted Seasonal Vegetables ($5). On my last visit the pan was filled with long thick spears of asparagus, sweet potato, cabbage, radishes, broccolini and cloves of garlic. Grab a loaf of their chewy bread ($3) and you have yourself a vegetarian option even a meat eater like me would love.Now if they added pizza to the menu, my life would be complete.Love is in the air... yes, Valentines Day is around the corner, but the love is really about the spontaneous lunch date I had the other day at Pane Bianco.For those wondering, my date was with my husband.  We left the baby at home (with a babysitter of course), and went out for a few hours to enjoy the beautiful weather.  After a stop at the Downtown Phoenix Public Market, we were both hungry and finally agreed to head to PB.  I hate to admit this, but it was my first time there... I had high expectations and PB delivered!  We sat outside on the picnic tables instead of taking advantage of the full service inside.  We shared a tomato mozzarella sandwich and a tuna salad.  Both were delicious!  Melt in your mouth delicious!  We also brought home their market sandwich for our babysitter (aka my mother-in-law).  It was a vegetable sandwich which she said was delicious.I'd heard the menu was limited, which it was, but there was still plenty to choose from.  I can't wait to return for lunch or dinner... and perhaps to take advantage of their private little room in back.  Anyone up for a little dinner party at Pane Bianco?!This is the perfect lunch spot. It's perfect for those who need an hour escape from a cubicle, it's perfect for those meeting friends for a leisurely lunch, it's perfect for a solo diner and it's perfect for a casual meeting. A sit-down restaurant lives on one side and a takeout market (with outdoor seating) lives on the other. The atmosphere is very farm-to-table'esque and lets out a fresh breathe of an open and airy environment of fresh products and friendly kitchen. The food here is what you would expect from Chris Bianco: pure perfection. The bread is fresh and fluffy, the cheese is creamy and the meats are grade A. The menu is extremely limited, but it still offers something for every appetite. They have a couple salads and a couple sandwiches, but be sure to ask about their daily specials. I had the pleasure of visiting Pane Bianco today for a business meeting and decided to enjoy the special. The special today was a prosciutto sandwich with melted cheese and tomato paste. The tomato paste really made the sandwich. The entire sandwich was filling without stuffing me and delightful with every bite. I think that it can be hard for individual diners to find a lunch spot that's comfortable for a "table for one." Luckily Pane Bianco is the perfect environment for this thanks to the takeout market and picnic tables in front.I have been coming to Pane Bianco since before the twins were born and before they expanded.  I love my fresh Mozzarella sandwich.  I had an appointment in downtown PHX, so I could finally get a fix.  It had been a few months since I had been able to go and get my sandwich.  I do agree with Iain B.  $10 for a sandwich is pretty hefty, but I cannot help but stop by when I am without the twins.  I was able to sit down at one of the picnic tables outside, yes it was hot, but that is why I live in AZ,  and enjoy my book while I ate my yummy treat.  My husband usually gets the Market sandwich, I had a taste of a few, they are really good, but nothing beats my choice.* FRESH LOCAL INGREDIENTS made with love ** Serves same pizza as Pizzeria Bianco but has spacious seating *before going to the airport, we had two more hours to kill. decided to check out Lux Cafe and what do we see?  PANE BIANCO!!! IT'S A SIGN!! heheh.  we were planning to visit pizzeria bianco and pane bianco on our weekend getaway. thought we were going to leave phoenix without it but we already dined at pizzeria bianco. we weren't planning to actually eat too much. no pizza this time since we wanted to try other items.it's a HUGE space. i recommend people to visit pane bianco versus pizzeria bianco since you can 1) seat more, 2) there isn't a line, 3) they serve the pizza. in fact, i like the rustic decor. brendan told us that lux cafe used to be in half the space until they acquired their own building next door. pane bianco was able to become much bigger.i was asking brendan so many questions, cuz that's what i do!! haha..he was more knowledgeable than the waitresses at pizzeria bianco or the cashier girl at pane bianco. guess it's not everyday people like me appear.  brendan was probably thinking that that was the reason they tell you what they use, the process, the history when he was hired to work there. some diner like me would be testing him. (he passed. heheh)on the board, there is a daily special. happy hour is 3-7pm daily -- $2 off beers.(the foccacia sandwiches are on the lunch menu)complimentary bread with EVOO. i felt that the bread here was slightly better than the one at pizzeria bianco. but really, it's the same bread.meatballs (side order) - i had my eyes on the meatballs...staring at the photos on the computer screen, so i knew this was what we were having. 3 good sized meatballs made from GRASS FED BEEF with crushed tomato sauce that was divine and a basil leaf. LOVE LOVE!!! market salad - they change it up daily/monthly but they follow a flavor palate. this time, it was a lighly dressed citrus viniagrette on a bed of arugula, oranges, candied pecans, and goat cheese. just what we were looking for.when we were at pizzeria bianco, we were so full that we didn't get to try dessert.this time, we ordered the vanilla rice pudding. when i was reading about it, other people said that it was enough for two.  well, it was a much more generous portion than i had imagined!!  it was topped with boysenberry jam and not too sweet.  perfect ending to our 'light' meal'.there are currently two pizzeria biancos (we didn't go to the other location) and one pane bianco. plans are in the works to expand adding a pizzeria bianco in tucson for the future. FIRST STOP, Pizzeria Bianco.LAST STOP, Pane Bianco.HAPPY EATING!!! =D
Peppersauce Cafe=Our team chose this place to have breakfast 2nd year in a row before our team build activity. I guess we spend so much time together we're starting to think alike because all 6 of us ordered the same thing, the chicken fried steak, gravy & eggs! Six people can't be wrong, we all cleaned our plates! I thought it was better than my usual favorite go to restaurant for chicken fried steak breakfast. This place appears to be a little hole in the wall Cafe but it was certainly busy, has great food and service to match,  one of those tucked away places that is a must try!
Best of Philly=I went here a couple weeks ago and was pleased with my cheese steak. I had it then with just the meat and cheese. Today when I returned, the guy at the counter asks, "With onions and mushrooms?" Okay, yeah. "Sweet or spicy peppers?" Spicy, please. And what I received knocked the socks off that earlier sandwich. This place is tiny, cramped, a bit chaotic and is apparently cooled by wall-mounted fans. Yet I can see myself going here on a regular basis. So, the next time you're having one of those moments, like Ameerah A, opt for the cheese steak. Just be sure to let me know before hand so we can meet up.
Indian Delhi Palace=First off, I must say, friendly smiles upon entering an establishment goes a looooong way for me. Family owned and nurtured with love comes through at Indian Delhi Palace. I've eaten in a few times and mostly had take out. Service was always right on, attentive not intrusive. Take out packaging is an art in my book. So often, things are forgotten, mispackaged and spilled and well, sometimes just tossed in a bag. Here they do it right. Garlic naan bread in house is better than to go. Unfortunately they wrap it in tinfoil and it sweats and loses any of it crispy outer crunch. Chicken tikka marsala has just enough cream and spice to hit all my F spots (you know like a G spot, only F for flavor!). Saffron rice is fluffy, flavorful and fantastic. Rickie loves their sauteed okra...generally not something high on my list to order but yowza Potsie...dee - lish. Samoras, tandori chicken all A's all around. And you can't beat a tall, cold Himalyan beer while waiting for that to go order and they always provide me with some papadum and a tangy, sour, spicy dip. Remember a smile goes along way with me!Coda B. and I both crave Indian Lunch Buffets when we're hungover. Him more so than me. He's actually called me at 12:30 at night, from a bar, talking about how he wants Indian Food. It's as though he can already feel the hangover coming on and wants to make sure his priorities are in check. 1) Get home (or wherever) safely 2) Indian Food. I may have mixed up the order.This Indian Delhi Palace is apparently under the same ownership as the Tempe location, but I like this one much better. For several reasons:1) The Chicken Tikka Masala is AMAZING. Like, I've never had buffet food this good before. I don't really like Tandoori Chicken. Honestly, the color kind of freaks me out. I know it's from the sauce or whatever, but chicken, on the bone, with a kind of fluorescent pink glow is weird. I'll pass. But boneless chicken in a delightful red curry sauce? Don't mind if I DO!2) This location has a much larger variety of dishes, especially vegetarian dishes, which are usually my favorite offerings at an Indian lunch buffet (see above about tandoori chicken freaking me out).3) Um, hello? It looks like a freaking palace. These guys did not hold back and I freaking love them for it. I actually think more places offering a lunch buffet should treat its patrons like the hungover royalty that we are. I wouldn't mind if Souper Salad and Sweet Tomato hopped on this trend already. I mean, how hard can it be to add a few fancy door arches and some gold plated silverware? Not that hard really. Up your game, guys.However, the only complaint I have about Indian Delhi Palace, and the primary reason why Flavors of India remains my favorite Indian Lunch Buffet has to do with the atmosphere. Yes, I appreciate the super sexy high-class water goblets, but Delhi Palace doesn't have any booths. And when I'm hungover, I need a freaking booth. I need my own little eating sofa. I need to be able to kick off my flip flops under the table and sprawl out like I'm enjoying their delicious naan on my own little loveseat. That's what I need, and that's what Flavors of India gives me. Oh, and some Bollywood wouldn't hurt either.I cooked dinner at home the last four nights in a row... this may be a record for me.  No joke!  We eat out way too much.  But, as a reward for all of my cooking as of late, my husband took me out to dinner tonight.I suggested we try Indian Delhi Palace, and he agreed!We walked in and were immediately greeted by Nick, Mr. Delhi Palace's son.  Nick is a college student with one hell of a sense of humor.  The banter between him and Jared made for one comical meal.  Here's what we ate:-Garlic Naan-Peas Pulaou (Basmati Rice cooked with Peas)-Fresh Okra with Sliced Onions, gentle Herbs and mild Spices-Bengan Bhartha (Eggplant roasted in a delightful pulp, seasoned with Gentle Herbs and Mild Spices)-Shrimp Tikka Masala-Kheer (Basmati Rice Pudding sprinkled with almonds and Pistachio)Everything was extremely tasty, especially the okra and shrimp dishes.  I normally do not like dishes that have onion in them, but pretty much everything we had contained a lot of it.  And actually, I still liked it!The serving sizes were large, so we took home leftovers.  The price was a bit steep ($60 out the door), but we really enjoyed it.  I think this will be my new "go-to" place for Indian food, and my new "go-to" place for dinner when I pick up friends and family at the airport around dinner time.As a side note, the Indian Delhi Palace building also has a large banquet room upstairs that Nick showed us upon our inquiry... it has a capacity of 250 and it's really nice.  Future Yelp event potential, perhaps?  We'll see about that.Yes, I am totally deducting a star because they charge for soda refills. Not just charge refill price (which is ridiculous anyway), but charge you for a WHOLE ADDITIONAL SODA when you get a refill. Who the eff does that? I can quite honestly say I'm never going here again, because I only crave Indian when I'm hungover and full flavored (not diet) ice cold coke is a hangover necessity. I'm not going to pay for each one I down, that could bankrupt me. Plus, everyone knows fountain soda costs like 4 cents a piece, who are they trying to fool?
Sam's Cafe=Saturday is Happy Hour day at Sam's Café. Happy because we hadn't been there in a while and happy because Sam's has improved since the last time we were there:)I say "judge slowly" and "give people a second chance" and "a stitch in time, saves nine" and all kinds of other inappropriate adages...but my point is that sometimes a second chance is in order.Sam's Café had been in the rotation for a few years and then we had a couple of poor experiences there, and just didn't go back...you know how it is...there's a lot of competition for the dining dollar (it used to be "dollars" but the recession/depression has hit everyone!).But, this isn't about then...it's about now, so let's get up to date, shall we?The Beautiful Carin and I headed for the club last Saturday to sweat off the weeks caloric build up and sweat it off we did! (you know, I think I sweat so much because I come from ice age survivor stock and here I am trying to live in the desert!).Anyway, after we finished our extremely grueling, yet fulfilling programs of physical exercise, got ourselves all cleaned up, (lookin' good and smellin' sweet) we were talking between ourselves (as married people often do) and trying to figure how to reward ourselves for the excellent workouts we had just finished.How about a nice big lunch?Sam's Café has Happy Hours on Saturday's and Sunday's that run from 11:00 am to 5:00 pm. Well, that's just inspired!We tottered in and sat at the bar (I think that's going to be a defining happy hour "move" for us), and the barman greeted us with a warmth and enthusiasm normally reserved for long lost play cousins...a good start:)We looked at the happy hour menu and they have some nice selections for really good prices.We ordered roast pork sliders with a chipotle barbecue sauce, Carin's  "go-to" selection...grilled chicken nacho's and Sedona Spring Rolls (also served with the chipotle barbecue sauce and pico de gallo).While were waiting for the food to arrive, Sam's minions brought us more food...chips and salsa. Now, I don't want anyone to think Sam's is mexcian food...it's not. The whole place is more "southwest inspired" as opposed to "southwest", or "Mexican" or "authentic". They have décor that looks sort of Fredrick Remington meets Javier Sordo Madaleno...nice, southwest-ish/modern. The chairs in the dining room are, frankly, less than comfortable but they fit the décor, so, OK. Just don't complain to me when they make your butt sore after 20 minutes!Back to the chips and salsa...I like the flour tortilla chips that Sam's serves, as well as the blue corn and sweet potato chips and the salsa is decent as well...very tomatoey, but spicy and flavorful, but it's not Mexican...not for everybody, but we were happy:)The actual food portion of our lunch came before we became completely engorged with the chips portion. Everything was very tasty. The pork roast sliders were truly delightful...moist, seasoned perfectly on soft warm rolls:) (BTW, I'm reasonably certain that you can't get swine flu from eating pork roast, but I will say that the roast pork sliders "flew" off the plate:) . The Sedona Spring Rolls have plenty of spice and heat, and are also very nice.All in all, a very solid Happy Hour offering for $18 and change (before tip).Go, sit at the bar (always better service and your butt will thank me), and enjoy Sam's Happy Hour!
Zen 32=Darn. I thought I'd be the first to review Zen 32! Hmmm. Apparently the 32 stands for 32nd Street. Zen on 32nd Street. Oh. How terribly clever. I just assumed, after a few visits there, the 32 stood for the number of minutes you wait before your server arrives. I get the style over substance restaurants. Sometimes it's about the scene and not the grub. And sometimes that's what I'm up for. And that's what Zen 32 is to me. Average sushi quality. Not as horrific as some have yelped. Words like. Crap. Horrific. Vomit. Really? Not very Zen of them, eh? I won't go out of my way to think of Zen, but if someone invites me, I'm inclined to say yes. They're open pretty late. By then, I'm ready for some drinks and maybe a bite or two of the fishy. Mostly, it's a place to people watch, visit and take bets on when you'll ever see your server again.I've been to Zen 32 more times than I can count... and for the most part, I've been extremely satisfied with each visit.  I was there for happy hour last night which is what is sparking this review, and it was perfect... we sat outside, enjoyed a couple of beers, and some very reasonably priced sushi.  At $3 a roll, you really cannot complain!I will agree with some of the pluses and minuses that Jenn H wrote about previously, such as:+ A great location+ Very fresh fish+ Low carb rolls+ Good sushi selection+ Neat little complimentary sunomono type appetizer (although we didn't receive ours last night... what's up with that?)+  A really good drink menu+ A great happy hour+ Great atmosphere- Long wait for a table, even when several tables are empty (this has been the case for me on several occasions but luckily, not last night)Wait staff is hit or miss - (luckily our server last night was fine although he didn't have much personality)- Tables really close together (both inside and out)In my case, the positives really outweigh the negatives.  In addition to above, they have a divine bamboo basket of steamed veggies - it includes broccoli, asparagus, sweet potato, carrot, and more. It's served with a light sweet sauce on the side and is the best if you feel like fresh yummy veggies, if you're on a diet, or just want some color to add to the mix of sushi!  Lastly, I left my long sleeve shirt there last night by accident, and luckily the hostess found it no problem when I called.  She was sweet as can be and is holding it for me to pick up today - it sounds like a no brainer, but I'm sure there are plenty of establishments that could F something so simple as that up!I'll be back today to pick up my shirt, but for sure in the future too!
Cyprus Grill of Phoenix=Nestled amongst the many malls along Camelback in the 18th to 24 th Street range, sits Cyprus Pita Grill. A cozy, airy, light filled space with an open kitchen, really hits the target. Again, a fave of John the chef, the beautiful Greek woman in the kitchen smiled at us (ok, she smiled at John). We both ordered the lamb pita and as a side choice, the greek fries. OMG, two words for ya, dee mutha freakin lishus! Man, I'm bad at math. I remember nothing of my math education, except for the crush I had on Mr. Johnson the geometry teacher/football coach/neighbor....and let me tell you he looked good in his bermuda shorts, black socks, shirtless and sweaty mowing his front lawn. But I digress...the fries...heavenly. Fries, cooked to perfection, with lemon juice and feta cheese, oh so good. The pita, was overstuffed with perfectly spiced lamb. Chased with a brisk, refreshing iced tea....a perfect lunch hour for the chef and I. Service was right on...friendly, effecient and professional. It reminded me of a cafe in Mykonos. That I saw on a postcard. OPAH yelpers!P.S. I want to dedicate this review to my friend Tod. No one could put away a Dr. Pepper like my friend Tod. Here's lookin' at you big guy...I love you!Went here with my sis today she never wants to go to FEZ ::sigh:: I had the falafel pita and she had the ceaser one. I had the passion fruit tee yummmmm I almost walked out with the glass I didnt want to put it down it was so good. Our pita's came out hekka quick the giant falafel balls were ok maybe a bit hard and dry in the center but pretty tasty. My sisters chicken was a tad burnt around the edges but she ate it all anyway! Next time I want to try the homemade sangria it sounded lovely!My first experience with Cyprus was about 4 years ago.  My husband was living in the neighborhood, but I was still in denial about moving to the Valley.  It was like a little vacation to come to "the city" and stay in our Biltmore apartment.  The novelty wore off quick once I moved here, but I still enjoy Cyprus.  It makes a nice precursor to a movie at AMC.  At Cyprus, my husband and I can both get get pitas, hummus, and drinks...or we can share the water fountain and 7 kernels of popcorn at the movies for the same price.My favorite part about Cyprus is the pita bread.  It's thick cushy pita, not the flavored cardboard pita they somehow manage to split open to make a pocket.  I'm a little partial to the chicken souvlaki with it's tangy tzatziki sauce, crunchy cucumbers, fresh lettuce and tomato.  The hummus is always tasty, although I seem to remember it being just a little better in the old days.  Not sure if they changed the recipe, or its just me remembering it differently.The only downside, the last two times I've been in we have been waited on by girls.  What happened to the Greek Gods?  Minus a star for that!I'm a fan of this place. Fantastic lunch option if you're on a bit of a health kick, and one of the best value takeaways you're going to find.My friend Sage introduced me to this place a while ago, and I seriously need to return soon. The Wait staff were really on the ball, friendly and personable. We were never left waiting but at the same time no intrusion into conversation.Go and enjoy! :-)How many bites does it take to get to the lamb filled center of a gyros-pop?I'd say one, cause if you can't find gyros on the first bite, there's probably something wrong with your order ;-) ... are you sure you didn't order the chicken?And you thought I was going to say something deep and meaningful, you obviously don't know me that well.Cypress Grill is my favorite place for a gyros in Central Phoenix. There's a handful of them around (gyros spots that is), but if you're looking for a gyros and within a few miles of this place, I'd say skip all the rest. I've tried at least five or so spots that serve em nearby. You'll spend a couple bucks more here than at the other places, with a gyro running you about $8, but I'm happy to conclude that Cypress is my favorite gyro in town.The hummus here is good, so is the spanikopita and dolmades. For those of you who are carb counting, you can get your gyros in a salad too. I've done that a few times myself. All in all a solid choice for medditeranean dining - one of the better spots in the area. Happy Yelping Phoenix!I've eaten here a couple of times and the service has always been friendly and the food quite good. My only suggestion for them would be to make the falafel less dense; other than that, I have no complaints. This is a good place to go for a nice and fast Mediterranean-style meal.My wife and I came here for lunch. This is a great place if you want to eat healthy. It is located in the Town & Country Shopping Center. I haven't been to the Town & Country Shopping Center in 15 -20 years.We were greeted by our waitress Rachel. She took our beverage order and allowed us time to look over the menu. We decided to start off our meal with an appetizer of Spinach and Artichoke dip. It was outstanding. For our entrée I got the chicken Souvlaki Dinner / kebab plate, which came with a generous amount of tender and flavorful chicken breast on two skewers. It was served with rice, pita bread and a Greek salad. The salad consisted of chopped cucumbers and tomatoes with a generous amount of feta cheese.  I also got a side of dolmades. The grilled chicken was moist, and tender. I was able to cut it with a fork. It was surprisingly good. In fact it was much better than some Mediterranean restaurants I've tried. The Dolmades were excellent. Plus the Tzatziki sauce was superb.My wife Carol got the Pork Souvlaki Dinner / kebab. It also came with a Greek salad, rice and pita bread, which she enjoyed. I tried some of the pork and it was delicious. Tender pieces of pork on a skewer marinated and grilled to perfection. Both dishes had lots of flavor.FOOD: The food is deeeelicious AMAZING delicious . When I say "amazing". I definitely mean it.  PRICE: Very reasonable.You get a lot of food for the price. SERVICE:  The service was superb.  AMBIANCE: Low key, nothing fancy, but comfortable.   CONUSION: If you're looking for a fancy restaurant with fancy service...then forget it. If you are looking for amazing Middle Eastern food and absolutely friendly service...welcome home. What a wonderful experience. RETURN  FACTOR: 100%************************* What does my OVERALL rating mean?*************************5 stars -Highly recommended.  I would be willing to drive out of my way to this business. It is that good. This place represents their industry or cuisine very well! 4 stars - Highly Recommended. I would frequent this business. 3 stars - Not that good but not that bad. Just average. I wouldn't mind going again if a friend or family member wanted to go. 2 stars - I would not recommend this establishment to friends or family. 1 stars - DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND DO NOT patronize this business. I would RUN AWAY from this place and you should too! DON'T WAST YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY AT THIS ESTABLISHMENT!
The Old Spaghetti Factory=First of all, their gluten free pasta is really good! It's yellow and made from corn. It's nearly unheard of to see an Italian restaurant (non-chain, chain, authentic or not) have a gluten free option. +1, seriously.I've always liked the Spaghetti Factory. It's not the best but it is dirt cheap and they have so many cool decorations. I'm a sucker for old antique-y looking stuff. The service can be slow and it's always busy, but hell...ALL Spaghetti Factories are this busy if not more. It's not an anomaly people. I'm just happy they have a call-ahead system so you don't have to wait for hours when you arrive.I love the Old Spaghetti Factory.   I have a few vague memories of eating at one as a kid, a college student, and now a full fledged adult.  I came here last night with my date, and we took the light rail.  Walked in, and it was quiet, but it was also a Sunday night.  We only had to wait 5 minutes.  The hostess and what appeared to be a manager were taking names.  The manager was so funny and personanable...when the girl said "what is your name?"  I spelled A-M-Y instead of just saying my dam name....when he called my name he spelled Amy instead! ! LOL. Date and I laughed!We ordered our food with our server, who was nice and knowledegable enough. But, we had to ask for our Bread!  For dinner I ended up with the spaghetti with meat sauce, dinner salad with Balsamic vinigrette dressing and it was tasty!  Date got a cheese pasta dish, and he said it was to cheesy.  O well.Anyways, place and service was fine, will be back, and I still love it here!I had the pleasure of spending my Friendaversary with the lovely Georgie S. this past Sunday at the Opera. Because we saw "La Boheme" I felt it only right to get Italian food, so we headed over to The Old Spaghetti Factory in hopes of satisfying our pasta craving.It was quite charming when our waiter came over with the bottle of wine that we ordered. It was the second most pricey bottle they sold (coming in at $34) and he told us in the four years he worked there he had never sold a bottle that expensive. Well, that's because you don't have high class broads like us patronizing this establishment, or so it would seem!They have a good sized menu with a lot of delicious looking dishes. I was especially excited that they have gluten-free pasta! I was hoping I would be able to eat more than a salad. On that note, I must point out that your meal comes with salad, bread, your entree, and iced tea, AND spumoni for dessert! If you choose not to get the tea and dessert, you get to knock $1.50 off the cost of your meal. That means that my large, tasty plate of pasta and the salad cost me $6.50.That's right folks, dinner for $6.50!The place itself is pretty charming. They have a trolley car in the middle you can sit in. The one drawback is that this place is very "family" oriented; something Miss G and I are not normally very "fond" of. But we dealt. Very solid 4 stars....The Old Spaghetti Factory is a fun chain restaurant where both families and larger, alcohol-fueled gatherings are at home.  I come from an area where "red Italian" menu items are commonplace, and mediocrity is the norm.  From this perspective, the cooking here is comforting and old-school; a notch above the ordinary, but nothing to get excited about.  Fortunately, portions are very generous, prices are quite reasonable and The Old Spaghetti Factory scores on that basis.  The lasagna was loaded with meat and just enough ricotta to balance.  Not enough mozzarella was buried under a thick coat of ho-hum tomato sauce.  Several other cheeses were (literally) throw-in's, the dish would improve with their removal or replacement with adequate quantities of garlic, basil, oregeno and/or onion.  Seasoning, in general, appears to be oriented toward their pre-school and geriatric patrons.  My coworker had the crab raviolli; it looked delicious, but a bit light on crab.  She did enjoy it.  While David was a capable and friendly waiter, the kitchen let him (and us) down.  Our appetizers and entrees were brought to the table within a minute of each other; completely unacceptable, and cause for the loss of one star.This place is a Phoenix original! Although  it used to be called The Spaghetti Company, things change. But, it is basically the same.Because, the owner got divorced he lost this location to his wife, who had it join the Chain of Spaghetti Factory.At first with all the changes, it suffered and was not as good as the Company was. But, they have ironed it out a bit and now it is better.The food is good. Not authentic Italian, but for the price it is a fantastic deal.Nothing to complain about at all.  You get a lot of food for a very low price.It is decorated really great. Very old fashioned Victorian style.Servers are friendly and do the best they can, because this place is always packed full.You get soup or salad, bread and butter, a meal , and dessert. All for less than $10.00.The menu has a lot to choose from as well.It is a great place to take children, because the whole family can go out and it does not break the bank. Bathrooms are clean, and lots of parking, additional in the back.Wonderfully charming place filled with attention to detail and comfort food!It is perfect for large & small groups. The food is very reasonably priced and the environment is appropriate for adults and children alike. I love the wooden floors, the cable car that sits in the center (it's a treat to be seated inside!), the separation of dinning areas into different rooms that provide large groups a measure of privacy & the small tables for 2 that all have plush and unique chairs.This location is on Central, directly across from the light rail. Unlike most restaurants in the area, it has a very large parking lot. Not having to worry about parking makes meals here that much more enjoyable :)
Guanaquito Restaurant=Tonight, I cheated on Eliana's with Guanaquito. I still feel a bit guilty, as I've been with Eliana's for years, but when Guanaquito does it better in almost every way, how can you fault me? If you blink, you'll miss it- on McDowell, between the Gourmet House of Hong Kong and Arizona Endoscopy Services. You need to park in back, accessible from a driveway before you pass by the dully colored sign for Guanaquito.Like Eliana's, it's Salvadoran cuisine, but there are so many more options at Guanaquito. They serve breakfast, lunch, and dinner, and based on tonight's sampling, Hubby and I will be back often to work our way through the menu. I had the ensalada drink and Hubby had the Horchata, which the waitress patiently explained was different from Mexican Horchata. It sure was- maybe it was the morrow seed that made it so unique. For his entree, Hubby had the equivalent of the sampler platter- a tamale (again, quite different from a Mexican tamale- softer and creamier), 2 pastales (meat pies) and 2 pupusas (stuffed, grilled tortillas). Guanaquito had a far greater variety of pupusas than Elaina's, and they were every bit as good. The one that I had that was most unique was made with cheese and loroco plant (which to me had an asparagus-y taste). Definitely delicious. At both Salvadoran places, we were served a bowl of cabbage salad, but at Eliana's we had never been told how to eat it. Guanaquito's was far less astringent and we were instructed to eat it with our pupusas. I was skeptical at first, but became quickly hooked. It did not overwhelm the taste of the pupusas, and added a nice crunch and zing. The only thing I found that Eliana's did better than Guanaquito was the flan. Guanaquito's texture was off, but the flavor was acceptable.I suppose I'm willing to share my new love with all of you- but be forewarned- she's a saucy mistress you'll be compelled to visit again and again. Oh- and she's cheap, too. Hubby and I got out of there for $24 (and that includes the extras I got to round out my leftovers for lunch tomorrow!).I popped in quickly to see if they took debit the girl behind the counter looked at me blankly and then at her father at least I am assuming thats what he was. He answered for her that they do so I told them I would return. I was early in meeting Amanda B. and Kevin H. so I parked myself at a table. I speak Spanish, does it say that some where on my forehead??? People seem to just "KNOW" this for some reason. Even when I responded in English they continued to speak Spanish to me here. I finally gave in and went with it, the girl said "Ah so you do speak Spanish" like it was some sort of test. She was very polite she did not speak English though and I basically translated for everyone throughout the meal. I have not had El Salvadoran in a really long time so I don't really have anything to compare. I deducted a star because everything had pork bits in it except the salsa and tortillas. I would go again if I was in the area, next time I will clarify no meat when I order.Bean & Cheese Pupusa - awesome very good minus the porkChile Relleno - very good, totally different than Mex. on the inside it was stuffed full of pork, potato and carrots among other stuff it reminded me of a stew minus the liquid.Horchata - Fresh from scratch very very delicious and sweet sugar high achievedI would like to try the soups they looked good and a little pricey.Thanks to Kevin for getting the tip you and Amanda are wonderful company!The pupusas, yes, the pupusas are great. The loroco with cheese has become our favorite, But this past week, I strayed from our standard and tried the gallina soup with braised chicken and salad. All I can say is, "What the hell? Where has this been my whole life?" The soup is magical. Huge chunks of carrot, potato, and zucchini, with some thin noodles, and a savory broth with some mint leaves. I quickly abandoned the rest of my entree in favor of finishing the huge bowl of magic. It was the best soup I've had since coming to Phoenix 13 years ago. Good thing Hubby got sick this weekend- it gave me an excuse to go back and get some more. Being magical, you know it has serious healing properties. Here's where I learned that the Sopa de Gallina is chicken soup without the chicken meat and the Sopa de Pollo is the same thing but with the meat. Two huge Styrofoam cups to go with lemon wedges and 4 hot and fresh tortillas cost less than $6.00. I was stunned. The owner said it costs more with meat. Believe me, you won't miss it. Who knew that magic was so cheap? Hubby's fever is already down and he's feeling much better.Guanaquito was the place picked for April's International Supper Club UYE, and this is truly a place you can't judge by its outsides.  From the outside, it looks pretty sketchy but one you walk in your put at ease.I knew before I got there that all I wanted was beans, rice and flour tortillas, its simple and it was what I was craving.  So after checking out the menu I went with Orden de Pupusas, it was 3 pupusas, beans, rice and a cabbage slaw of sorts.  If you are unsure of what pupusas are, they are like a smaller thicker flour tortilla and are stuffed in the middle. The 3 I ordered were stuffed with beans and cheese, this was the perfect meal for me, just what I was craving. The surprising part of the meal though was the rice, this was some really good rice, I am not really a rice person, but this rice was just perfect. The cabbage slaw, which isn't even the correct way of describing it, was the perfect topping for the pupusas. Now I am looking forward to going back and trying out other items on the menu, everyone's dish looked great!
Cajun Queen=Once upon a time in a city FAR FAR AWAY (from HOME = Chicago) a Beautiful young woman and her handsome husband were toying around on Groupon while house hunting  (The Queen City = Charlotte) and low and behold a deal for this place by the name of Cajun Queen.Considering that we met in New Orleans, LA and my great grandmother is from the French Quarters and cooked Cajun food regularly, we have a distinctive taste bud for AMAZING to Moderate Authentic Cajun Food.When you approach you would not expect the crowd that this place draws, I ALWAYS make a reservation on Open Table before going ALWAYS. It's a HUGE house that was transitioned into a restaurant and a HUGE house it is in order to fit that many people at tables inside for brunch, lunch and dinner. It's not that large but considering that it was a HOME it's HUGE.The day we decided on land to build our home on we decided to go celebrate and have dinner using our Groupon. THIS WAS ONE OF THE BEST GROUPON DEALS WE EVER OBTAINED mainly due to the Southern feel, the TASTE, the SERVICE, etc...I am not a FIVE star type of woman by far, I have to be pretty impressed and Cajun Queen has been VERY consistent. We've been more than 20 times now and I am just writing my review because I had to wait to ensure that there was consistency with the service, taste and feel of this place.Cajun Queen is our GO-TO restaurant when we have family or friends visit. We like to take them somewhere that they can't go when they are back in their perspective cities that is also AMAZING and leave a memory in their mouth and mind. We've had everything from craw-fish appetizer, fried green tomatoes, Fried Oysters, etc.. to Entrees including the Blacken Salmon topped with craw-fish and artichoke & sun dried tomato, Shrimp & Craw-fish Diane, Chicken Diane, Gumbo, Seafood Etouffee', New Orleans Platter (Fried Everything) etc..All items mentioned are AWESOME, there are ALWAYS deals on Groupon however we go with or without a Groupon because it's WELL WORTH IT.. Be sure to make a reservation and if you don't be prepared to wait, however the bar area is small upstairs but a good time to say the least.Happy Eating
The Nosh Cafe=I can completely thank Yelp App for this great find, I was way too early to head into work and wanted some breakfast and not from a fast food chain, so I looked what was in the area and found the Nosh Cafe so off I went.When I got there it had a little line, but don't worry, it moves sort of fast, while waiting in line I checked out the menu board and saw they had a lot going on, that I want to try it all, but I had to limit my choice to just one this time around.Now they have breakfasts off the grill and breakfast sandwiches, so I knew the sandwiched sounded good, so I checked out the selection and went with the Ranchero on a jalapeno bagel and a large caramel latte. The Ranchero was egg, sausage, red onion & house made southwest cream cheese; it was a great breakfast bagel sandwich.Happy to had found Nosh Cafe, and saw they do lunch and its less than 2 miles from my work, so I can pretty much say I will be back again soon.
East End Food Co-Op=A great little place. I love their produce, fruits, meats and spices. They carry alot of very hard to find skin care products that I love. They were even the first place in Pittsburgh that carried Carol's Daughter products. They also carry pre made salads, sandwiches and wraps. Sure it's not as big as I would like but it's still a great place. If you like Whole Foods and Trader Joe's you will like this place as well.
Bobby C's Bar & Lounge=This place had the most AMAZING meatloaf, fried chicken, and mac & cheese. I also ordered a side of greens which were good but a little too salty for me. I don't order meatloaf at restaurants mainly because I know it'll probably be dry or have no flavor, but I had this feeling that Bobby C's would make it perfectly. I wasn't disappointed. It had this slight crunchiness on the outside that was like little heavenly crunchy bits. The fried chicken beat the pants off of any other soul food restaurant I've been to. It was so juicy and to die for. The mac and cheese was another hit. Next time I'm going to order the mashed potatoes and gravy as well! The staff was really friendly and the atmosphere was loungy with great old school tunes being played on their nice sound system.
The Bamboo Club=Ugh. I realize now that any place with the words club, factory or n things in their name I'm gonna give 2 stars or less. Or the word rainforest. But that's a different story. I dared to try something exotic. Salt and pepper shrimp. Hey, I'm Scandanavian. Pepper is an exotic spice to my people. But, I'm sorry, pepper must have been 86d that day. It was more like Salt shrimp. Or Soggy ass salt shrimp. Not good. We had the obligatory chain restaurant appetizer combo. No Awesome Blossom here folks. But overall this beat the entrees. Chased down with a lychee nut cocktail I was ready to quit this club. Service was amiable, but we were stuck in a corner, blocked in by a large party, with, ugh, children. Or as I so affectionately called them, Children of the Corn. Not much joy in this club. Or luck with entree selection. So I say no. No to the Joyless Luckless Bamboo Club.
AZTECA Bakeries & Restaurant=Great place for Mexican Baked Goods (Pan Dulce). They have cochitos, churros, zinger rolls, Mexican wedding cookies, empanadas, and several other festive pastries.  I like to drop in on my way to the office when I'm feeling nice and want to treat my co-workers to a little culture. Unlike bagels and store bought doughnuts, these treats are always gone by mid morning and that's how I like it.  Also good for a hearty breakfast burrito.  Try the Chorizo, Potato, Bean and Egg 4-way. Que Bueno!  I can't vouch for any of the lunch/dinner combo meals but will return for the baked goods and burritos.A good place to have some really good burritos. Place is neat and has a good atmosphere. Price is decent enough. Not much to expect here though.
Radio Maria=I am not impressed with this place.  My friend and I walk into the bar side for tapas.  I had read the reviews on yelp before I went, but my friend really wanted to check this place out.  My first impression:  There are at least 7 empty tables and a totally empty bar.  The hostess asks us how many, and are we here for drinks, tapas, or full meal?  I tell her tapas, and she tells us it's going to be 5-10 minutes, would we like to have a drink at the bar?  Sure, we walk past several empty tables and sit at the empty bar.  We are impressed with the blue light coming out from the bar top, when a "bartender" walks past and LITERALLY THROWS a drink menu onto the bar near us.  And keeps walking by.  I wasn't shocked because I had read the reviews, but I thought that was totally rude.I asked another guy walking by for a glass of water.  He was able to ablige, and by the time we got our water, amazingly the empty table behind us was available.  We sat, checked out a menu, ordered 3 tapas, and my friend ordered a beer and I ordered a glass of wine.  It took quite awhile for just the drinks to get delivered.  I was disappointed in the amount that they called a "glass" was about half of a glass I've gotten at other restaurants.  And when I was looking at the wine list, I asked for a recommendation, and said I didn't like fruity reds, I preferred more on the dry side.  I took a sip of an incredibly fruity red wine.  Sigh...When the food arrived, it was alright.  Maybe I just expect more.  It was okay food, just not as tasty as I've had elsewhere.  There were no outstanding flavors, or a bite of food that made me sit back and go "wow."  Just ...average.The waitress asked if we wanted to see the dessert menu.  Sure, why not.  We went with the dark chocolate cake.  About 20 minutes later, we finally got the cake.  What took so long?  Who knows.  Maybe they had to bake the cake after we ordered it...  Anyway, I have NEVER left a piece of chocolate cake on a plate at a restaurant before.  My friend said the cake tasted like deli meat to her.  How does one make cake taste like deli meat?  I have no idea.  It tasted out right burnt to me.  Burnt cake peeled out of a pan, with some hersey's syrup on top to cover the taste.I ask for the check.  She came by with the check, I gave her my credit card, and away she went.  Another 15 minutes passed, and she had walked by our table about 5 times.  The next time she walked by, I asked her for the credit card receipt.  She was totally suprised, and hadn't realized she had never given it back to us.  She was sincere, it was just annoying.  I wasn't impressed with the food, and somewhat unhappy with the service.  There was dancing (salsa or something) starting as we were leaving, but I wasn't in the mood for it.  I don't know if I would recommend this place.  Maybe once just to go...  but I think once is enough.
Fujo=Just when I was about to give up on good sushi in Charlotte my neighbor introduced me to FUJO or what he calls his secret Chinese restaurant. Fujo is tucked away in the Wachovia building downtown. The menu is huge you can try anything from one of their more exotic sushi rolls like the Cajun Roll - (Shrimp & Crawfish Inside: Topped w/ Spicy Crab and Cajun Spice) to authentic and tasty Chinese dishes like chicken with garlic sauce. The hardest part is choosing what to eat. Did I mention that they serve my favorite wine here I haven't seen it in any other restaurant around yet...Sophia Coppola's sparkling white wine it's served in a little pink can. That just makes the experience that much better. You never have to wait for a table and its a great place for a group dinner before heading out for some drinks uptown.
Smoky Jon's #1 BBQ=When I only ordered sandwiches I was doing it all wrong. The way to go is to get a half chicken and the 1/3 slab combo with brisket. Insane amount of food? Yes. Worth getting to try all the best parts of the menu? Yes!After surviving my first tornado scare in Madison, Wisconsin, my partner in crime, Daniel L. and I ventured out to this well known local BBQ hangout for some good old smoky ribs and all the fixings.With the Midwest reputation of having some of the finest meats, it was a no brainer to order the 1/3 slab BBQ smoked ribs and pork shoulder sandwich combination dinner ($14.75). The staff mentioned the pork shoulder and the beef brisket were the top sellers besides the ribs.The pork shoulder was pigilicious! The shredded meat was perfectly seasoned with the rub and then hickory smoked which gave its own taste without the addition of the BBQ sauce. It also impressed me because there were was no sign of grease on the pork. The bun was a standard bread bun compared to the sweet roll which accompanied the dinner combination. We took the recommendation of the staff and ordered the extra meat (additional 5 ounces for $3) since were feeling extra carnivorous! The BBQ pork ribs came with five succulent ribs with the meat just waiting to fall off the bone. Each bite had a generous coating of their famous award winning BBQ sauce. Our dinner combination came with two choices of side orders which we picked the baked beans and cole slaw. Both were served in a small styrofoam cups along with the BBQ sauce. It's easy to see why the BBQ sauce won numerous award because of it's rich, sweet and peppery flavor. I'm not a fan of cole slaw but this one exceed my expectations with its creaminess and was extra cold. The baked beans maintained a firm texture and should be ordered with any meal because the sauce was so addictive.The cabin style interior holds 11 tables and is very close to the Madison airport. The actual BBQ pit is located a few miles away from the restaurant. So grab your dental floss and wet naps and eat some authentic BBQ at Smoky Jon's!EDIT - REPLY TO SMOKY JON - ORIGINAL REVIEW BELOWHi Jon,This is the same canned reply you leave for all of your negative reviews (yep, read them all), and it shows the same cavalier attitude as your bbq.... In reading through all of the reviews, the one thing noticed is that the vast majority of positive reviews are unable to compare to bbq eaten in the known meccas of this country, while the negative reviews have many comparisons to KC, Texas, S Carolina, etc, etc.....  you know, the people that have been around and actually do KNOW what it is they are APPRECIATING.Knowing that you HAVE won numerous awards in these very places, you would think that you wouldn't fall back on the review rating of those that don't know any better. No slam, I didn't know bbq from bratwurst until I started traveling either, but maybe it would be best to show WI what good bbq is, and not high-five yourself for being better than burgers and brats off the old Weber.... as my review stated, your place does have the potential to do that.So, while respecting your opinion as well, I still must disagree with you, and have offered all of the actual reasons for doing so. In the end, it's your business, run it how you will - just don't point at awards for sauces you don't offer, years of experience when it's not you at the pit, and a canned reply to those of us that know bbq stating we must not know how to appreciate it..... Also - my original review had everything in it regarding how to raise your food up to my, and many others, standards. Fix those issues, and I'll give it another shot. Best Regards,CalebHi Caleb,Thanks for your feedback, I respect your opinion but I must disagree with you. As you can see on the other reviews and by the awards we have won, our BBQ has great quality and taste. Also, we've been on the market for over 25 years, which makes us a great BBQ tradition for those who know how to appreciate it. Please contact me next time you visit us and we'll make sure our food is up to your standards.Best,Jon Olson ORIGINAL REVIEWI'm not sure why this place has 4 stars - was some of the worst bbq (with potential, will explain after I complain) that I've had. I also get that this IS Wisconsin, and bbq has a whole different meaning than in the bbq meccas around the nation, but damn....Ordered 1/2 rack w 1/2 chicken, 1/3 rack w pork shoulder sandwich, and 1/3 rack w brisket sandwich. Sides of baked beans, mashed potatoes, and mac-n-cheese. So, pretty good variety of what they offer. The bad:- membrane not removed from ribs - trying to eat meat stuck to a huge piece of essentially dried and smoked skin as the bones are pulled apart is pretty gross. Any pitmaster or fan of bbq knows this needs to be removed prior to smoking, any other explanation boils down to plain laziness. Fully half of the meat was stuck to the membrane as it fell off the bones. And a star is lost!- chicken was smoked beyond merely dry - think chicken jerkey. And a star is lost!- both sandwiches were minced meat to the point of being indistinguishable from one another in both taste and appearance. Where are the slices of brisket and juicy chunks/shreds of pork? Not here. And a star is lost!- only one bbq sauce is offered standard, the only other flavor (same sauce, only spicier) has to be ordered separately and at extra cost. Sides were very small (about 2oz) and nothing extraordinary - mac-n-cheese was somehow "flour-ey" with overcooked noodles. Can't imagine what end piece of corn with 5 kernels I would have received had I ordered that. And a star is lost!The "potential":The taste of the ribs was not bad, the chicken as well. I think if the "pitmaster" was given a raise and some training, or given the boot and replaced with someone qualified to run the pit, the food could be brought to par. I also think it's not to much to ask for a wider variety of sauces - where are the sauces that all of the newspaper clippings on the walls referencing Smoky Jon's contest awards at? Quit being cheap with the sides. I like taters, more than 5 bites please!! Hook up the mac with some cheese!! I support small businesses and love bbq, give me a reason to!!The "good":Staff is friendly. Most of the food had good flavor, but fell way short on the prep/handling end. Place was very clean and smelled delicious.
Postino Arcadia=I was in town and my friend wanted to take me to the place across the street from Postino but they weren't opened for lunch.  Fine with me because Postino turned out great!  The valet boy and one of the other men waiting for a table gave us good reviews so we said, why not?It's been a long while since my friend and I saw each other so we were talking a lot in-between trying to figure out what to order.  The waitress had to come back 3 times before we settled on something, but she was cool with it.  Known for their bruschetta and sandwiches, that's exactly what we ordered.  The bruschetta came with 4 different options so we chose Mozzarella with Tomato and Basil (good), Chopped Tomato with Pesto (very fresh and tasty), Salami with Pesto (slightly salty but very good), and the Prosciutto with Figs and Mascarpone (my favorite).Thinking we weren't going to be full on just some bread, we also ordered the ham & cheese panini (nicely toasted and yummy).  It comes with a salad and the waitress split this w/o us mentioning it.  We ended up only eating half the sandwich and half the bruschetta.  The bruschetta were big (about the size of your palm -- not mine, because I have small hands) and thick as well.  The toppings were generous and all very fresh.I'd definitely come back next time I'm in town.Postino Winecafe is a longtime favorite of mine... Not sure why it took me so long to write my own review, maybe because the 67 that came before mine do a pretty good job of describing it.  However, I woke up today and felt like giving my two cents - so here goes:Whether you go to Postino for a business lunch, an afternoon glass of wine, a happy hour, dinner, or even after dinner drink - you can't go wrong!  Postino is great for any occasion!  (Although maybe not a big group based on what I read in previous reviews).  I've been for pretty much all of the occasions listed above, and every visit to Postino, I leave a satisfied customer.  My favorite lunchtime menu items are the brushcetta (perfect for sharing as an appetizer and fun to choose from the variety of delicious selections), the Mixed Greens Salad (which comes with shaved pears, candied pecans, red grapes, gorgonzola, and crispy leeks served with poppyseed vinaigrette - and I usually add turkey to it too), and the Raspberry Chicken Salad.  LOL at my long description, but had to include it all!I'm not usually a daytime drinker but I'm all for starting happy hour early and taking advantage of 'wine by the glass' $4 special - great wine list! The ambiance and service is fantastic and it's fun to people watch at Postino as well.  It's a fantastic little neighborhood place, and there are several little details that make Postino stand out in my eyes... next time you're there, check out the sugar / sweet'n low dish thing on the table - there's a little something special there if you need to spit out your gum before digging into your meal :)  Also check out the branded rolls of TP in the bathroom - so cute!Can't wait to go on a Monday night sometime soon to take advantage of their special: $9 off a bottle of wine and pizza from LGO!  Postino has a regular loyal customer in me and I don't see that changing anytime soon!This is one of my favorite wine bars I have been to.  The wine list is great and the food is just as good!It has an upscale feel and makes you think you are in NYC (but without the homeless people peeing on the building); they have a great vib going on and you will LOVE it!Oh yes, and you know what... it used to be a Post Office, SWEETI've been to Postino a few times, but as we all know it is a violation of Yelp TOS to review an establishment until you've been drunk there. What? It's not? Well, I would consider it in poor taste.I got drunk at Postino last night and had a wonderful time. The $20 Bruschetta Board and Bottle of Wine promotion they have Mondays and Tuesdays is a ridiculous steal. I didn't want to be the alcey to ask if that deal was limited to one-per-table as I was fully planning on consuming my own bottle of wine and possibly my own board of bruschetta. Luckily the guys across the bar had the same plan, so I didn't have to. FYI: It is illegal for restaurants to serve you your own bottle of wine. Don't ask how I know. I just know. However, you can split 3 or 4 with one other person and nobody says anything. Don't ask how I know this either. I just know. All of the different bruschetta options are fantastic. The Prosciutto one tasted like Cinnamon Toast to me. That may have been the booze talking. Considering I kept referring to it as "Cinnamon Toast Crunch", I'm going to go ahead and say it was. The roasted red pepper & goat cheese and the apple & brie were equally delicious. Sorry, I don't have a breakfast cereal comparison for them. To top it off, the service is fan-freaking-tastic. Everyone is extremely helpful and seems genuinely HAPPY  that you are there spending money. Clearly, from a business standpoint, this should be a given, but more often than not it isn't. Once I was there with a girl whose recently adopted Greyhound was somehow prompted to dart across the patio like a bat out of hell, knocking over chairs and wine glasses along the way. Not only was the staff RIDICULOUSLY nice about it, a few of the valet guys actually CHASED AFTER this greyhound and I'm pretty sure one of them got into his car to find it. The staff literally organized an impromptu search party for a dog that could run upwards of 60 MPH. That is some damn good service. And, we found the dog.Last night I made my second trip to Postino and was in the company of a very lovely young woman. Lucky me :) I had been to this location one other time, but I wasn't there very long and I forgot what I ate. SO, i was really looking forward to this trip. Plus, Amber W was kind enough to give me a gift card for Christmas. Thanks Amber! The parking here is sort of on the ridiculous side because the lot is so small. You have to valet your vehicle. I think it was $3. It was busy when we arrived and were quoted about 25 minutes. So we went over to the waiting area to start with some wine. We didn't even have a chance to order because our table was ready already. We were seated outside and I feared for my date's life because it was a little chilly and I don't think the dress she was wearing was really made for winter nights. Thankfully there was a heater planted right behind her. Our server took our drink orders promptly. I had the Tierra de Luna Malbec. Very good. She had a Reisling, which was very sweet and fruity. Started with the bruschetta and holy schnikes! I could have eaten this all night. We opted for the Smoked Salmon with capers and Pesto, the Tomato, Basil, & Mozzarella, the Ricotta with pistachios and dates, and the Brie with apples and fig spread. All of them were amazing! I am not a salmon fan, but this smoked salmon was delicious! It was also my first attempt at Brie. This too was good. For the meal, my lady friend or special lady, (Big Lebowski random quote) had the Raspberry Chicken salad. It was chunky chicken salad on a bed of greens with a raspberry vinaigrette. I was told it was good. I went for the half panini and soup combo. I had the Vegetarian with the Tomato and Gorgonzola soup. Originally the wrong panini came out. The server got it replaced and put the wrong one in a to go box to take home. Thought that was nice for the mix up. The soup was excellent. It is a very close second to The Roosevelt's tomato soup. The Vegetarian panini was good, but could have used a little more veggies on it. Unfortunately there was no room for dessert, but they all sounded amazing. Overall, a great experience with great food and drink. Service was great and the atmosphere was perfect. Again, thanks Amber W for the gift!!!Time to share some opinions here that the majority might not agree with...Sandra Bullock is a horrible actressHigh School was NOT the best time of my lifePostino Winecafe does not live up to the hype...while I write this, I of course realize that most people sadly somehow enjoy Sandra Bullock films, think High School was a blast, and...at least according to the reviews on Yelp, adore Postino Winecafe. The food is decent enough...bruschetta was flavorful (although on our last visit the bread was a little hard) and the Pub Board appetizer is amazing. The main gripe we have with this place is the service. Do you have to spend a lot of money on alcohol or look like a hipster here to get good service or what? We went for a light meal...nothing more. I don't see a sign on the door that says 'must buy wine', so why did our waiter treat us like a couple of vagrants while he was overly friendly to tables around us who were spending more money? I get it...higher bill, higher tip...this is no excuse for bad service though. A paying customer is a paying customer. The disparity in service couldn't have been more painfully obvious, and that's a shame. Maybe we went on an off night...or maybe Postino is getting cocky...who knows?We had a decent meal, but left feeling like outsiders instead of valued guests. Maybe next time if I wear a 'deep V-neck' and Katrina wears some 'jeggings', we'll appear wealthier and get better service. Eh.3.25/5.It's way too loud in here. I prefer the Central Ave. location.You know when a movie comes out and EVERYONE is talking about how great it is and when you finally see it you are extremely disappointed and wonder what all the fuss was about? That is what I half expected about Postinos.  Instead, this place EXCEEDED the already high expectations others had set in place for it. I came here on a Friday evening a couple of weeks ago after a wine tasting at LGO. It was 6:30-7:00pm and we only waited a couple of minutes for a table. It was just me and a girlfriend and since we have the same taste in wine, we decided to order a bottle to share.  We had the RIckshaw Pinot Noir which was delightful.  For food we had the Cheeseboard and the mozzarella and tomato jr.  AMAZING.  I love cheese (as do most wine lovers) and their cheeseboard was delicious.  It features a great variety of cheeses from mild to strong in flavor.  In my eyes the best combo of foods and flavors is the ever simplistic tomatoes, mozzarella, and basil.  Postinos does it perfecto. Everything is fresh as fresh as can be, my mouth is watering just thinking about it!I had major food envy when I saw the table next to us get served an impressive plate of Bruschetta.  I will definitely be trying that the next time I come. Here is how much I loved this place: I just found out my schedule is changing and I'll be getting off work at 3 instead of 5.  Literally the first thought that popped in my head was "I can make it to Postino's for their amazing happy hour!" I literally can not wait to go back to this place.I have 231 reviews so far and none for one of my all time favorite AZ restaurants? I have to rectify that now. If you love wine and bruschetta than this will be your own version of Heaven. Blasphemy? Then you've never been to Postino! Seriously, they have the best bruschetta you're likely to ever have in your entire life. My top four: 1) Prosciutto with Figs & Mascarpone2) Brie & Apples with Fig Spread3) Roasted Peppers with Goat Cheese4) Burrata, Bacon, Arugula & TomatoesAlso worthy of mention are the amazing sandwiches. I highly recommend the Autostrada (Sopresatta, Italian ham, cappicola, mortadella, provolone, arugula and tomatoes with spicy pepper relish) and the Nine Iron (Hickory smoked bacon layered with grilled chicken, fresh burrata mozzarella, lettuce, beefsteak tomato and dijonnaise). Fucking awesome.As you'll read in most of the other reviews, Postino has a great Monday and Tuesday night special, a bottle of wine and a bruschetta board for only $20. But be warned, it'll be jam packed. Keep in mind they have two other locations as well. For you east valley residents there is a new Gilbert loction. If you are in downtown Phoenix or west valley, then the Central Avenue location a couple blocks north of Camelback will be more convenient.With its outstanding food, decor, and ambiance, I'm going to give you a Paul V. guarantee that you will love Postino.Always my 'go to' wine bar to hang with my girls.. :-) AND I am in love with the Sangria Sundays there.. We go early to secure our choice table.. under a mister.. in the patio section of where WE want to be.. looking swag! Gettin our Sangria on.. and our bruschetta.. We know the whole thing by heart.. NOW the last time we were there.. We did send a salad back.. NO question from the cutie serving it. He took it.. and said he was sorry.. brought a little extra bruschetta.. and BAM. NOW looka there.. I kept the 5star on the yelp! Actually, it would be hard for Postino to lose that with me, because I have been coming here since I moved to the PHX and no other wine bar compares. I heart all things Postino.. MY only wish.. Sangrias all week!I'm on a huge Postino kick lately and had another awesome dinner there last night with five girlfriends.  Since my last review of this place was in 2008, I figured it was time for an update, but honestly, not too much has changed since then - I'm a very loyal customer and have been for years!My favorite menu items are still the same too:The artichoke dip (which actually comes with hummus too but I always special request double artichoke instead because I love it so much), the mixed green salad with added turkey, chicken, or prosciutto, and the bruschetta board... My top two bruschetta faves are Brie & Apple with Fig Spread and Prosciutto, Fig & Mascarpone. Mmmmm!I'm not currently drinking (I'm prego again), but of course this is the perfect place to go for a glass of wine or four as well!  Service is always fabulous and the atmosphere rocks too.  So in my eyes, this place deserves five stars... even almost five years from my original review!Of course, it is worth noting that it's not only a favorite of mine, there are plenty of others that love it too... so, sometimes you may have to wait a bit.  If you've got a large party (eight or more), I highly recommend making a reservation ahead of time.I'm such a fan of my Postino! I am addicted to the bruschetta! I start craving it after a few weeks of not having it! In fact, I will go bread free and NOT have any bread .. SO I can load up on bruschetta when I come here. This place is packed.. No matter when you come here. I want to say get here 'early' , but truly.. there is no 'early' at Postino. Just get here! Get your name on the list and get your belly near the bar and get your drinks ordered. I usually never change things up too much. I love red wines and that is what I go with .. always. I like the $5 wines until 5pm. After that, if this is where my group is hanging , we generally go with the bottle then. The bottles are priced at 3x the amount of the glass price. Not bad and not hard to figure out. The meat board is great .. the cheese board is divine. All bruschettas ...mmmmmm. I've never done any desserts here. Maybe I should . But I usually am not a dessert girl. So I use my calories on wine, bread and cheese! I only brought my star down one as the last time I was here our waiter was to split the bill with me and my flight attendant friend from NYC. Instead, not only did he split it, he split and added the full cost to my card too! It took about 5 business days to correct! I'm still a fan, though.Catering: I catered a small gathering at my place with bruschettas and paninis . Perfect and on time. You pay as you order.Postino has 3 locations around the Valley!  I've been to 2 of them now and the one thing you can say about Postino, they are an amazing place to dine/drink and they are very consistent with service, quality and ambiance.  We typically go the Postino on Central, however we dined here a couple of weeks ago with some friends and found them to be fantastic! I really like the patio area!! It was too cold for us on this trip however this is a "must come back" kinda of place just to enjoy a great meal on their patio!!Food~ if your dining for lunch go straight to the salads and/or bruschettas!!  Their portions are actually larger than you think and after you pick and choose some of the different ones to eat, you'll thank me for passing on the apps!!  However if you re dinning for dinner or have a larger group or a huge appetite, then go ahead and order some apps.  I suggest trying their Bella Postino~ warm artichoke dip and white bean hummus with assorted breads or their Butcher's Block~ with different artisan meats and cheeses served with Tuscan beans, olives, nuts and crostini.  Both are DELISH!  Bruschetta's~ here are some of our faves;  Prosciutto with Figs & Mascarpone, the Smoked Salmon with Pesto is my go to!! The Burrata, Bacon, Arugula & Tomato is also a go to!  We also like to try their seasonal burchettas as well!  Paninis~ go for the prosciutto with brie or their Nine Iron with smoked bacon layered with grilled chicken, fresh burrata mozzarella, lettuce, beefsteak tomato and special sauce = nom.nom.nom!! Service~  our service was a little slower than what we are used to at their Central location however our server was very friendly, knew the menu well and tried her best to keep up.All in all it was a FANTASTIC experience!! My friends and I are looking forward to coming back on a Monday or Tuesday when they have their $20 special, a bottle of wine and burchetta ~ put me down for 2 please! I hope to see you there.Two words:Prosciutto With Brie on Focaccia Bread.  Okay, that was a lot more than 2 words, but I don't care.  It was downright amazing; like my tastebuds were being dry humped by the best sandwich ever invented in the History of the World (Part II).On a Monday/Tuesday night, if you time it right, Postino's is a neighborhood staple in Arcadia. The $20 for a bottle and board of bruschetta is a *steal*. As one of employee said, "How could you not order this?" while we waited for our table.  My friend and I arrived early to request a table for four. Perched on a tall side table we enjoyed a full view of the restaurant. Sipping not so daintily we quickly passed the 45 minute wait.  Once seated Bethany was a wonder. Our bill was seamlessly transferred and waters arrived. The neat thing about traveling in a pack of four is that, Yes, You Can drink three bottles of wine. What could possibly be better than that? It removes the need to think hard about the bruschetta menu. (There are 12 options so we had one of each brought out.)We surprised the fella in the group. He doubted that three bruschetta boards would be sufficient to feed his hungry belly. If you haven't been before, a bruschetta is palm sized and sliced into four pieces. Trust me, there's plenty. But if you're still hungry this is a wine bar and they have food. The panini selection is wonderful, I beg to argue the Nine Iron is the best.  (Bacon layered with grilled chicken, burrata mozzarella, lettuce, beefsteak tomato and dijonnaise!) Another approach, perhaps on another visit, is to order the Butchers Block (big assortment of meat and cheese) for $14 and/or the Cheese Board for $13.If for some reason wine is not up your alley, Postino's offers pitchers of beer. If you need to drink a cocktail...suck it up kid. That's not happening here. The Mon/Tue special begins at 8pm. I'd recommend scoring a table before the start time, even if that means buying some appetizers beforehand. Make sure to ask for Bethany! She's the sweetest thing!Came here for my birthday with my wife and some friends. All the photos of the food made me crazy hungry so we could not resist.Place looks like it could have been an old post office in another lifetime. Inside has been redecorated and there is a really nice patio for you outdoors folks. No need to check your mail here. Just order what looks good and they deliver it right to your table.Started with the Butcher's Block Starter plate and an ice cold Italian Beer. It was beautiful and tasty at the same time. Decided to go with the famous Bruschetta next. What did we not try is the question. There are so many choices.Brie & Apple with Fig Spread, Prosciutto with Figs & Mascarpone, Warm Artichoke Spread, the yummy Ricotta with Dates & Pistachios and a few others that were not so great.We all enjoyed anything with Figs on it. The plates were very colorful and the quality of the food was very high and fresh. Sounds like a good portion of their products come from right here in the valley. Nice!Recommend coming here during the day and not at night. The lighting is very dim and we had to use a flashlight app on my phone to see the food and menu. Maybe I'm justing getting too old for the late night thing.Seen other reviews saying that the best areas to sit are on the patio or right between the inside and outdoor seating area. Not sure how that works when it is a crisp 118 degrees outside. I bet the cheese starts melting rather fast.Definitely a fun and enjoyable time. The Bruschetta is out of this world and a new favorite of mine. Looking forward to trying out some of the other locations. SALUTE!4.25 STARSMy husband and I went to Postino for a dinner date during a recent weekend trip to Phoenix. It wasn't quite what we expected--we'd assumed it was the kind of Italian place where you could get a glass of wine and a plate of pasta--but we had a great time.Our reservation was for eight o'clock on a Saturday night, and the place was busy but comfortable. It felt intimate and not too crowded. The lighting was low, and the space was warm and charming. A great go-to date spot. Service was great. Our waitress was friendly and helpful, and we were well taken care of.Postino is more a wine bar than a full sit-down restaurant, with reasonably priced bottles and a menu that consists of large format antipasti and paninis. We ordered a bottle of Canto Sur, a red blend of mostly cabernet and carmenere. You can get wines by the glass here, but the bottle prices are only three times the glass prices, putting most of the bottles in the high twenties/low thirties range. We were happy with the wine. We also ordered a few antipasti and tried to order paninis for our dinner when our waitress stopped us--she said what we thought were antipastis would fill us up plenty, and she was absolutely right.Granted, we were planning to order a pretty big spread of appetizers. We shared the butcher's block, the pub board, and a selection of four bruschetta. Did not realize that each of these boards would be gigantic. Everything was delicious. The butcher's block came with plenty of meat--prosciutto, coppa, salami, and peppered salami--along with goat cheese and white bean hummus. There was crostini, of course, and a huge assortment of great accompaniments--olives, dried cranberries, almonds, asparagus, cherry tomatoes, smoked yellow tomatoes, and three kinds of pickle.The pub board brought another huge spread, this one of MJ's soft pretzels, Scrheiner's chorizo, cornichons, aged cheddar, and giant Spanish corn nuts. It was fun to mix and match everything on these boards, and it was all fantastic. The bruschetta seems to be the main draw of Postino, but I didn't understand why until our selection arrived. We opted to order four of them for $14, and were expecting bruschetta sized like bruschetta. These were more like full-on flatbreads, with the four bruschetta adding up to about a pizza in volume. We had the tomato jam and fresh sheep's milk cheese, the salami with pesto, the prosciutto with figs and mascarpone, and the burrata, bacon, arugula, and tomato. Not a dud in the bunch--loved all the meat, and the tangy cheese with the sweet tomato jam was perfect on its own.We took great pleasure in our feast of antipasti and wine. We ate with our hands and enjoyed the variety. I'd love to go back to Postino next time I'm in Phoenix. I'd be a regular if I lived in town.
Sun Up Brewing=I am a fan and supporter of local breweries here in the valley. Last night I visited two of them in the city, SunUp was my second stop for the evening. So first impression when I walked in was that this place has got some interesting history to it. There were pictures of past figures and well known people within the community. The bar area has some limited seating so if you wanna head there with some friends, somebody needs to get there early. The rest of the place has plenty of seating for more private conversations. The brews are not too bad and I know I have seen the sunup crew at alot of beer festivals and events, so I do like that they go out there and represent who they are, gotta keep local brews alive! Llast night for me was two pints which were descently priced HOWEVER with my Yelp check-in, I only paid one dollar per pint and even got discounted appetizers! I was shocked but after talking to my bartender, I come to find out the owner is crazy for yelpers! So if you don't minda smaller size bar and a not too bad central location, go down a get a pint or two for a buck!
Dairy Queen=Dairy Queen? Or Dirty Queen? And I'm not talking about my femmy neighbor with the Member's Only jacket drenched in Patchouli. Really, it's not working. You're just stinky. But this DQ could use a visit from Mr. Clean and the Brawny paper towel guy. Both of whom I've had huge crushes on. Napkins, papers and spoons on the floor. Behind the counter wasn't a pretty picture either. They weren't busy and should have been cleaning. You know what they say..."If there's time to lean, there's time to clean." However, my simple little vanilla cone really hit the spot. For that...2 stars. Staff was friendly. One more. Total. Three stars
Havana Cafe=Bring on the mojitos!  Or a pitcher of sangria. Both are terrific at Havana.  Even if you aren't interested in alcohol you are in luck. This place is worth it without the booze too.Every time I come here I am so happy. The place is usually bustling and busy, yet I never have to wait. The service is so friendly that I feel valued as a patron and the food is great.  Some of the dishes I recommend: - The salads are out of this world. All of them are a good choice. My fave involves onions, avocados and mangoes- The Cho-Cho is a great vegetarian dish. I'm a flesh eatin', animal killin' meat eater but I still enjoy this menu item- Fish! Every fishy is yummy here. The best are the Sea Bass, Shrimp and the Tilapia - The Pollo Cubana is an excellent basic chicken/rice/bean dish  - The Ropa Vieja was okay. Pretty good but not out of this world- The desserts are excellent. The coconut flan with mango sauce is my new favorite thing ever - They put limes in my diet coke. YES! Nice touch.* One word of caution: They make you valet during the weekend. Not a fan of the unnecessary (but very personable) valet. Boo!** Second word of caution: The bathrooms are outside and around the corner. Be prepared to feel like you are walking down a shady alley if you have to pee. Maybe fear of an alley attack is part of the charm. Just like in Cuba, I guess.First, I'd like to send a shout-out to Irma, our server who has given me hope that there are caring hospitable people in the food industry.  Irma receives 5 stars for taking good care of me and my sweetheart during our recent date at the Havana Cafe. Way to go Irma!We step into a well packed restaurant on a Friday night with plans to try the Sailor's Paella Special and a few cocktails. We wait for just a few seconds until we are greeted by Irma and her warm smile and are led to our table. Our cocktail orders are taken immediately, 1 Mojito and 1 White Sangria. Both exceeded our expectations and were just thing to get our date started.The ambiance is whimsical and charming - Reminded me of the movie "The Bird Cage" without the drag queens and dramatic dialogue. Bummer!Now on to the Paella. It was the perfect dish for the evening offering plenty of shrimp, calamari, crab, scallops, muscles, tuna and a healthy serving of saffron rice. This meal also requires a little handy work to get to the crab and muscles but you are given the proper instruments to do so. This may not be the best choice for those who do not enjoy this kind of food activity but we had a lot of fun with it.  We will be back soon to try another interactive meal and partake of a round or two of Mojitos. So if you are in the mood for something different, fun, and oh so delicioso, I recommend you try a night out at the Havana Cafe. I also hope you have the pleasure of meeting a groovy gal who goes by the name Irma.If you want to go to Havana Cafe, follow my lead:I can't break the delicious habit of starting with a mango rum mojito or sangria depending on my mood. No need to order "dinner." Chose 3 tapas... I'll pick two and you can pick ONE. I pick the papa rellena ($6.50) potato croquettes about the size of a tennis ball (one for each of us) filled with ground beef and topped with a delicious lime cilantro sauce (Yes, I used the words delicious and cilantro in the same sentence! Me! The girl who HATES cilantro!!) and the black bean fritters (frituras de frijoles negres $5.25), little poppers accompanied by a scrumptious calypso avocado dip that is laced with either sour cream or cream cheese or both! The third item is your choice. Finish it off with a Cuban coffee (a sweetened shot of espresso) and possibly, depending on willpower or lack thereof, the Caribbean candy bar - coconut flan topped with a rum fudge sauce and toasted almonds. Truly, this is the best way to enjoy Havana Cafe!We tried Havana Cafe last night for the first time... Without mojitos or sangria, perhaps we didn't get the full experience, so I'll have to return for those and sit inside next time too.  But it was a beautiful night, so our party chose outside instead.  Irma was our server (see Robert M's review).  She was fabulous.  We started with a variety of empanadas and the black bean fritters.  I was not a fan of the 'calypso avocado dip' that comes on the side of the fritters - it reminded me of store bought guacamole that is so creamy, it doesn't even taste like avocado.  The fritters themselves were alright and same with the empanadas.  Next course was chorizo, fish of the day (halibut), and sides of yucca con mojo and asparagus.  I'm a huge yucca fan, so it's always a treat for me when I go to a Cuban restaurant... and it delivered at Havana!  Yum... gotta love that interesting texture!All in all a pleasant experience - I will return with a larger party sometime for the real deal!  Thanks again to Irma for taking good care of us!Craving authentic Cuban cuisine? Well I was, and with one trip to Havana Cafe I satistied my craving. With a small and basic interior, it is far from a glamourized restaurant. However, what Havana Cafe lacks in apperance it makes up for in substance. Quality of the food, authenticity of the dishes and excellent customer service are the factors that really make this place stand out for me. Everything I tasted was extremely rich and packed with flavor. I ordered the ceviche, and it was AWESOME. It left an essence of piquant limes, ripe tomatoes and crisp bell peppers lingering on my tongue. I also thoroughly enjoyed their fried plantain chips with black bean dip (you've got to try it!!!!) This place serves the real Cuban deal.The food here isn't cheap, so plan on spending a good chunk of change on your meal. Also, I'm hoping that I just visited on an off night because the mojito I ordered tasted more like a margarita as it lacked that refreshingly crisp mojito taste. It was disappointing but I'm determined to come back here and give them another chance. That way, I'll have an excuse to check out their mojito specials on Mondays!Our server was awesome and highly attentive. The fact that they have live music is also pretty cool. Overall, this place has a lot of authentic character and that's why I'm a fan. I enjoy unique dining experiences, and Havana Cafe definitely fits that bill. So, if your looking for something different, check this place out! Your taste buds will thank you.Still as good as I remembered! This visit around I tried the following:Alcapurrias (Picadillo stuffed croquette made from tropical vegetable masa)Tostones (Twice-fried green plantains)Arroz con Gandules (Pigeon peas cooked with rice, pork, olives and capers)Mofongo (Crushed plantains and pork cracklings)Sangria made with Red wineCortadito (Café Cubano laced with steamed milk)Between the Tostones & the Calypso chips, I prefer the Calypso chips. The Arroz con Gandules is very good, you can really taste the saltiness of the capers.The Mofongo were my absolute FAVORITES :D  They are very basic, but who needs more?!As far as the Cortadito goes, I'm pretty sure that I could feel my pupils dilating as I was drinking the tiny cup down, lol. If this is a diluted Cuban Coffee, I'm not sure I'm ready for the real deal! Even though it was strong, or perhaps because it was so strong, I feel like I'm hooked! :) Word of warning, if you don't like garlic, you need to really consider your choices. I don't think there are many dishes made without the use of garlic.I've been to Havana café before, but it's been at least 5 years or so. Long enough for me to forget that this place was forgettable, in my own opinion. Take that for what it is, I don't eat much Cuban food.I was unexcited to find that Havana café didn't have any spots available to park, and the rest of the open spots in the parking lot were all labeled specifically for the next door flower shop, coffee shop, and so on. What was I to do? I risked it and parked in a flower shop spot, and well, I wasn't towed, but I still felt like I was doing something wrong by parking there :-/Ultimately, I was lured back with a groupon they had available a few months ago. My first mistake was expecting that I could use my groupon to pay for meals which both totaled above $30 (the value of my groupon) and ALSO ordering additional items from their HH menu. I asked for two of their mojitos and was told that I couldn't order HH since I was using a groupon also. I obliged and let them know that water was just fine. My guess is they realized I wanted to buy my drinks in addition to our meals, and the waitress came back a few minutes later and told us she would put our drink order on a separate check. Nice save on their part - I was a bit miffed at first!My second mistake was not realizing how excessively sweet their mojito was going to be. I saw at the bottom of the glass, what appeared to be a large spoonful of sugar. In this case, it didn't help the medicine go down. After them accommodating me with the drink order and all, I didn't want to make a big to do out of this, so I soldiered my way through my drink.I ordered a shredded beef dish, and my wife a shredded/pulled pork dish. Apparently Cuban's like bell peppers and onions a heck of a lot more than I do. The peppers and onions with my dish accounted for about 3/4th's of the meal. I ate two or three slices of the peppers and a few slices of the onion, but was not satisfied with the small amount of beef the meal came with for a sticker price of $16, and even at $8 since I was paying about half with the groupon.My third mistake was choosing to sub their house vegetables for the beans and rice. I don't eat that many carbs, so often I will exchange potatoes, fries, rice, etc for whatever vegetable is available. The waitress explained that it was a mixture of squash, zucchini, mushrooms, and a few others. In reality, it turned out to be a few slices of squash, a few slices of zucchini, a couple of mushrooms, and guess what, a bucket load of chopped bell peppers and chopped onions. They were also nice enough to charge me extra for the substitution with the meal now totaling $18 before tax and tip.Two $6 mojito's, two $16 meals, an upcharge for the vegetables, and a $5 forgettable appetizer (I don't exactly remember what it was at this point). I was leaving with a $65 meal after tax and tip, hey, I saved $15 on the groupon though.Happy Yelping Phoenix, I hope I made it apparent how unimpressive this spot is. Maybe you prefer pan fried peppers with a bit of beef and a side of... pan fried peppers.Ah, the dreaded worst-experience of my life, horrible service, overcharged BIRTHDAY meal...that ended up in moderate-severe food poisoning.I'm talking the kind of food poisoning where at one point I desecrated the restrooms of a lovely restaurant in downtown Phoenix and ended up laying face down on the sidewalk...to where a homeless man asked me if I was ok.Yeah.  It was that bad.  Food poisoning aside, it was STILL the worst meal of my life, and this WAS my favorite low-key restaurant in the valley.Apparently my birthday fell on the last day of a groupon or livingsocial redemption.  Unlucky us, we paid full price (more than actually...since we were charged for the wrong items they brought out and subsequently took back), and were treated worse somehow than the coupon folks -- because it was a set menu and so the kitchen didn't want to make things not on THAT menu -- despite our paying full freaking price.FACT: When one is celebrating their birthday, they want a cocktail.  I wanted a cocktail.  Actually, I wanted three.  I got my first cocktail after I'd been there nearly an hour (oh yeah, the "10 minute" wait I was told about was actually 40).  I didn't get a refill.  Or asked if I wanted a refill. Of that drink, or my water.  But I asked!  Oh, did I ask!   I drank my water and my dining companions.  And then eventually drank the melted ice from my un-refilled mojito. The 2 employees (great staffing job on a day you know will be busy with coupon redeemers!) were basically losing their minds, running around, and super stressed.  They had basically given up by the time we were eating. That is why I feel like the food poisoning occurred from something truly awful. Like employees deliberately fucking with my food horrible.I'm not sure what they normally do when people have their birthday at a restaurant, but we weren't offered dessert menus, let alone a comped dessert.  They knew it was my birthday.  They knew at the beginning we were paying the full price.  And still...worst.service.ever.***I actually filled out a comment card back in November listing my email address and phone number, where I specifically requested to be contacted (again, this was before the food poisoning).  This review was written right after the visit, and I sort of "sat" on it for literally over 6 months, in hopes someone would actually contact me.  I gave them the chance, I guess they really just don't give a shit."But I took three years of Spanish and I can't understand anything!" - said my friend. It's not necessary here. Irma was helping us. When I pulled her over to inquire why she was going to cry, it was because a patron couldn't possibly eat his postre. (A general word for dessert.) Irma, our amazing server, laughed when I said I'd take his dessert. This is very laid back, chill place serving authentic food in an unassuming place.I miss hearing my parents and family banter in their Colombian selves. Cubans apparently mix and mingle in a similar fashion. Irma wove her magic throughout the restaurant, smiling and laughing. Quite possibly the happiest woman in Phoenix. (Eventually a delicious red sangria was selected, which went down entirely too fast.)But back to the menu. The menu is clear to understand to anyone, from any corner of the world. Yes, I had a head start as many of the dishes share palates with Colombia. However, the menu here is clearly translated into English for anyone to decipher. No need to fret. And if you're overwhelmed by choices, there are two things that might help you order. Forks designate "Havana Signature Items". Additionally you can opt for a Combination or Sampler plate. It's for the "I Just Don't Know" moments.SEATINGI came here the night someone had their wedding reception! So yes, Havana Cafe readily can accommodate groups. With charm, sincerity and the utmost attention they can provide wonderful service to a party of two. We arrived separately on a Tuesday night around 6-ish pm. Patrons started to trickle in more so around 7pm. Upon arriving I learned there wasn't really a bar area to wait for my friend to arrive. No matter, I was promptly seated even though my party had not fully arrived.FOODEager to eat we ordered fried plantains. When offered an option as to how they were prepared, I jumped and asked for Tostones. The pounded green ones (vs. the sweet kind.) Salty, but not too salty, served with a side of mojo-garlic lime sauce. My mom and aunt prepare them slightly crispier, but these were still delicious.For a meal the Ropa Vieja was divine. Humongous, but delicious. Shredded beef brisket, bell peppers, onions, tomato wine sauce and black beans over rice. I was surprised by the difference in texture of the onions on the rice vs. the brisket. It was nice to have a sweet, fresh onion on the rice. The brisket had a blended texture of spices with the vegetables. (Enough left overs for two more meals. But I'm a girl eating 3 ounces of protein in a meal.)The night was young, and ma ' belly was full. The flan looked tempting. I'll have to send a recon mission back just for that!And yes, the leftovers were excellent :)
New Hong Kong=This was a great novel thing back in the dayA Chinese restaurant that offered boofayOh but the times they have a-change-edAnd Hong Kong has not arrange-edTo keep up with their competitionOr to make any change or additionTo the way they've always done itSo despite the fire that tried to run it To the ground a few years backHong Kong lingers, although quite whack,The ghosts of americhino lovers' past foraysWill haunt this MSG pit 'till its dying days.To start off, this place is actually called "New Hong Kong" restaurant. http://www.yelp.com/biz/new-hong-kong-phoenix  It was originally called Hong Kong Restaurant from the 1950's and they kept the 60 year old sign in the parking lot (kinda nostalgic).  If you look at the sign on the building, it says New Hong Kong (kind of confusing when you Yelp it)If you ask any of the old school chinese who have lived in central phoenix for the past 50 years where to get authentic home style cooking, they know it's at NHK.If you ask the buffet community where to eat, this place is probably not on the top 100 (disclaimer:  I've never eaten the lunch buffet)Sadly, it seems that the old school chinese community that patronize this place don't give it the Yelp reviews that it deserves, hence the low ratings.If you're looking for traditional Cantonese style food, here's a list of semi-authentic stuff I recommend:1) Beef chow fun2) Tomato beef over Hong Kong style noodles3) Fish filet over Gai Lon (Chinese broccoli)4) Salt/pepper chicken wings (not on the menu)5) Peking pork chops6) West lake beef soup7) X.O. green beansIf you want to go hard core Toi-sahn hillbilly style home cooking like poh-poh and ngain-ngain used to make:1) Hom-yee guy lup chow fon (preserved salty fish, with chicken fried rice)2) Foo-guah guy, Ow-see (Bitter melon chicken with black been sauce)3) Gee-ngoke-beng (Steamed pork with preserved salty fish)4) Hoh-yeow gai-lon (Steamed chinese brocolli with oyster sauce)5) Bok-jom-guy (Boiled chicken with garlic and ginger sauce)6) Muy-choi-kow-yuk (Fatty pork hot-pot with preserved vegetable)7) Bok choy with black mushroomOccasionally, they will bring out the compimentary house special Doang-guah gong (winter melon) or linh-gnaw gong (some sort of chinese turnip) soup.This place is a well kept secret, spread the wealth I tell ya.
El Conquistador=So....You say you want authentico?? My family secret shhhh! This place is owned by a lady named Maria. We have dubbed this place just "Maria's" we have been going here for year's!! When the white folk's around me say let's go to Valley Luna I have to school them on what's real food. This food is pure Jalisco and it is what it is! If you want some good home style cookin' in this part of town I would stop in for a bite! You better believe that this place gets busy for dinner so plan accordingly or don't go at peak times for those who don't like crowds. This is a nice little place w a bar and tv's. My sibling's would live here if they could my sister swears by the green chili burro, not for the weak as it brings the heat. I don't eat meat so I get the norm cheese enchiladas, chile relleno, etc all super in my book. I will take pics soon in the meantime here is a recent write up about the place http://www.azcentral.com/ent/dining/articles/2008/03/20/20080320elconquistador.htmlP.S. Closed Monday's
Denny's===Gay Denny's Bingo==[ ] Uncomfortable looking straight couple. What, you thought they called it "gay denny's" because it was so merry?[ ] Half-drunk valley girl frantically slapping her boyfriend in the face. Whether it's to get him out of his drunken stupor or to arouse him, it doesn't seem to be working, babe.[ ] Random cop harassing transexual/transvestite about "being lewd in public" or some other bullshit. Lewd? You're the one trying to put them handcuffs and take them to your car. Get over your lame self.[ ] Waitress who has to wake up passed out patrons to bring them their food. [ ] Guy who leaves instructions for his friends to order for him so he can get his puke on. (Holy shit...Nathan?)[ ] People fixing their makeup...in the men's restroom.[ ] Glitter on the seats. And the table. Oh my god where is all this fucking glitter coming from?[ ] Guy who, despite seeing that really hot girl making out with another girl, still thinks he's got a chance, and seems legitimately confused when girl is not interested in him. Just because her girlfriend's in the toilet doesn't mean she goes into "straight mode" for the next ten minutes. [ ] Dumb yelper taking notes for a future review. (Holy shit...me?)Ahhhh....Jenny's. Good ole Jenny's. Gay as gay can be. Depending on when you are there of course. I've found myself at Jenny's post bar rush stuffing my pie hole with a club sandwich, fries and many glasses of Coca Cola. Then there's the late morning, early afternoon call from friends who want to gather at Jenny's, eat greasy food to soak up the previous evening's booze and dish about who fell down, who got arrested and who will end up on dirty.com! Of course, we all secretly hope it is us!I love diner waitresses. They get it. They have the patience of a saint and the sass and swagger of a sailor. All the while delivering my hot plate of eggs, shredded hash browns (can you say Ore Ida!?), various meats and extra butter on the toast please. God bless 'em. God bless them all! So Jenny's has a place in our hearts. Not on Valentine's Day. Not on the books for New Year's Eve. But, dayum, if I'm not grateful to have you Jenny on that famous CenPho corner, we call 7th Street and Camelback.
Waldhorn Restaurant=Took my 96 year old dad here for lunch.  He wanted potato pancakes without looking at the menu.  We ordered them and he LOVED them.  Said they were the best he has had and wants to go back for more.I had a very nice veal and mushroom "stew" on top of Spatzle, the German home made egg noodles.  They were excellent and when I gave some to my dad he said that next time he wants a large bowl of Spatzle with butter and salt.No, he is not really easy to please, but the Waldhorn pleases him and that pleased us.
Pete's Fish & Chips=Like many institutions in Phoenix, you can't live here unless you LOVE Pete's!! I have seen and heard many a Phoenician defend their beloved Pete's as they would that other famous fast food mecca Carolina's. I have lived in Phoenix my entire life and love Pete's and this is why I can stay! lol. From the street, it looks like an old take-out place that's all cute and retro... but noooooo... it's really an old take out place. and it produces some serious food! Whenever I go, I always peek at the mini factory of people dredging and frying all sorts of goodies. Shrimp (my fave), fish filets, hush puppies, corndogs, burritos and fries. Once upon a time there used to be signs that read "NO TATAR SAUCE, SO DON'T EVEN ASK!" and all you had was Pete's patented red sauce that was part ketchup, part hot sauce but all lovely. Pete's sauce made everything taste better. It went well with the corndogs, the burritos, the fish, the shrimp, the fries and don't even get me started on the burgers!Sadly, after DECADES of refusing the Phoenix masses their precious tartar sauce and forcing them to enjoy Pete's sauce (for their own good) Pete's has caved and now offers Tartar sauce... and it sucks! So now many people won't even get the chance to even try the glorious Pete's sauce... cuz they want their old standard Tartar sauce! *sigh* My fellow yelpers, if you haven't had Pete's yet - GO! And try the fish & shrimp combo and if your appetite is healthy - try a small burger and get extra sauce and enjoy!! It's worth it!! :)
Different Pointe of View=This restaurant is 5 stars for the view alone (which is what everyone else has mentioned), but the food and service are excellent too. The other night my girlfriend and I went back for the first time since the amazing Yelp event earlier in the year. We started the night off with a drink at sunset on the outdoor patio, overlooking most of Phoenix. Then we headed inside for our dinner and the manager greeted us with a "Thank you for coming back to Different Pointe of View," which I thought was a nice touch. I assume he knew we were returning since I mentioned we had a card for a free bottle of sparkling wine when I made the reservations weeks before. We were seated inside near the window and our waiter was very friendly and attentive. Our bottle of Champagne was presented to us to start the night and we placed our food orders. We decided to split the Braised Duck Ravioli ($12) and the Pan Seared Diver Scallops ($15). There were two raviolis and two scallops per order and we felt both dishes great choices. The scallops were some of the best I have ever had. For our main course we each ordered the Grilled Cedar River Filet Mignon ($38). The perfectly prepared tenderloin steak was accompanied with horseradish crust, Swiss chard, roasted fingerling potatoes, smoked apple wood bacon, chives, Crème Fraiche and port wine pomegranate reduction. No I didn't memorize all of that, of course I retyped it from the menu.For dessert we split the Classic Tahitian Vanilla Bean Crème Brulee (all desserts $9). It was delicious, but rather small and didn't quite satisfy my sweet tooth. The buttercream blue cheese cookie and fresh strawberries were a nice addition, but even with those it was too small a dish. Overall, I 100% recommend you stop in and have dinner and drinks at Different Pointe of View. It has been one of my favorite Phoenix restaurants for many years. It's a perfect place for locals and out of town visitors alike. My only recommendations for improvements would be to add a server or two to the outside patio bar area since it tends to be slow on busy evenings. Also, I think the names for some of their dishes are a bit much and could be shortened.I came here with my two sisters a couple weeks ago and all three of us agreed it was one of the best experience dining experiences any of us had ever had. We had gotten a limousine so that we didn't need a DD but we were disappointed when the driver informed us he would have to drop us off at the resort so we could take a shuttle to the top (the road is too steep and narrow for a limo). The friendly shuttle driver told us that this is a common surprise to groups coming for special occasion parties like the prom. So, just something to be aware of. Once we got up to the top, it really did feel like the place was built right into the mountain top. You can see the exposed rock of the cliffside surrounding the entrance. It was very cool. We rode an elevator to the top floor and you could see why they wanted to be as high up as possible. The view was stunning. I am sure it would be gorgeous at sunset but this was around 8pm and I personally really enjoyed being able to see all the city lights shimmering below us. The design of the restaurant is upscale but understated; they keep everything neutral so that the large wall of floor to ceiling windows is the main focus.We decided to do the tasting menu and I am so glad we did. It was worth every penny ($80pp plus $40 for wine). The portions were a decent size and every one was delicious and unique. My sisters requested no shellfish or veal (and unfortunately I had to comply) so the chef substituted two of the dishes with something else. Our waiter was very diligent about making sure that we were all happy. We started with a piece of pork belly with wild mushrooms on a bed of bleu cheese polenta. This was a surprising first course (I think it was supposed to be shrimp) but I loved it! The pork melted in my mouth and I loved the tangy bleu cheese mixed with the creamy polenta. We had gotten the wine pairing as well so the sommelier made his appearance and explained that since we were changing up the dishes he was changing up the wines as well. He selected a very light red that had enough tannins to complement the pork and the cheese but was still light enough for a first course. This wine is not on their list but he had a couple bottles that he was trying out himself and he picked that one for us since he knew it would go with the dish that the chef had changed around for us. I couldn't believe how accommodating the staff was to their guests and how coordinated and educated they were. Second course we got a Pillsbury Rose which was also fantastic and the sommelier told us all about the history of this local winery and some stories about the AZ wine culture in general. It was awesome. The wine went perfectly with the salad we were served of assorted micro-greens with fresh currants and a tangy, fruity vinaigrette. A nice surprise was that under the greens were some hamachi sashimi. The fish was delectable and the salad was an explosion of flavors. I love dried currants in baked goods and currant jam but I have never in my life even seen a fresh currant, never mind bunches of them still on the vine. It was very cool! The next course was the fish course, accompanied by a crisp white blend. I am not a fan of sea bass but this one was cooked perfectly and it was a different type that was pink like salmon. I confess it did not convert me to being a sea bass lover but I loved the vegetables it was served with so much that I scraped up the remaining sauce with the rest of the bread in the bread basket (which was a very tasty focaccia, btw). The last course was the highlight of the whole experience. It was medallions of venison tenderloin. They were well-done (which is how I like my meat) but still completely fork-tender. The sauce for this dish was equally delectable, a sweet red wine reduction. The flavors in this dish were fantastic and the portion size was so large that my sisters had to take half of theirs home. The wine for this dish was a wonderful red that was so amazing I am going to go hunt it down and I will buy at least one bottle no matter how much it costs. I managed to save a bit to go with my chocolate cake dessert. The cake was good but it also came with a small cup of a super-thick and creamy hot chocolate that was out-of-this world. I thought it was great that we each got to pick our own dessert but my sisters both ended up not caring for theirs. One ordered the Apples on the Rocks, which is the one all the Yelpers raved about but it was completely tasteless and boring. It tasted like they had messed up and forgotten a few ingredients (like sugar?). My other sister ordered the chocolate and chestnuts dessert which was at least passable but somewhat blah. The boring desserts were not a big deal, though, since by that point we were sooo full!It was such a fantastic experience from start to finish I really think this is one of those places every Phoenician must go at least once. Great food, great service, great ambiance. I highly recommend!Dined on Friday, 2/22/13. My wife and I recently moved to the Phoenix area from Chicago and I really had no idea about where to dine. It was my wife's birthday and I wanted to dine at least at a 4 star restaurant- so I came to Yelp for advice.Our reservation was 8:15pm and we arrived at 7:55pm. We were invited to sit in the lounge area, which we did, and I expected to do so since we were so early.  We sat in the lounge for about 10 mins and were not approached by a server. In fact, I thought there were no servers since I saw none on the floor so I went to the bar and ordered myself, just like I would at a Chicago neighborhood bar. (Irk#1)Drinks were good and strong, but REALLY pricey- $26 for 2 drinks.Around 8:30pm, we went back to the hostess desk as no one came to get us for our reservation yet, (they said they would find us in the lounge). We were told our table still wasn't ready and to wait by the fireplace. I was a little peeved now and Iwould have expected to wait if I was late- but we were sufficiently on time I thought. We were seated after waiting another 5 mins or so. (8:45pm-30 mins late)(Irk#2) The wait staff, I thought, were pretty good overall. They did a lot of table "hopping", i.e. covered each other's tables, so diners were well taken care of yet not too pushy or chatty.We both ordered the lobster bisque soup. I ordered the halibut and my wife ordered the scallops. Bread was not brought to the table until after we ordered dinner- which was 10 mins after we were seated. (irk #3) The sourdough bread was excellent. The focaccia bread was kind of bland and dry. There were 3 dipping sides offered with the bread, which were very good. Lobster bisque was quite delicious. They put this "hydroponically infused" basil seasoning on top of the soup that was very good. I thought the soup was a little overcooked (sitting in the pot too long taste) but still good. My dinner arrived hot and the halibut was bland and little overcooked. (pan-fried). I asked for 2 more pieces of the sourdough bread to eat with my dinner and we were told they were "out" of sourdough. (irk#4). Friday night dinner service and out of bread? Really? My wife's scallops were cool as well as her vegetable sides on the plate. (irk #5)The waiter didn't check on us until 10 mins after the dinner was serves (irk#6) so it wasn't feasible to send it back to get reheated. The waiter offered us comp deserts for the trouble, at least.The last irk (#7) was that we asked for a bag to put our left-over take home boxes in- 3 total boxes. The waiter said they "were out of bags". He checked twice and the 3rd time brought us a Home Depot bag. I asked if he went to his car to get it. How difficult would it have been for the restaurant manager to go down to the gift shop and grab a couple of dozen bags? Maybe my expectations are too high since I'm from Chicago(?), but when  a restaurant is rated 5 stars by all of you Yelpers, I expect a little better service when dropping a couple of hundred bucks. Other than the view and the ambiance- I wouldn't recommend this restaurant.I really want this place to be more than exceptional but after the second visit (months after the first) I can only say this:  you pay too much for the view.The service is very old-fashioned and very doting but the menu needs a re-think.  Times have changed but this place is stuck in the 90's.  bottom line, it is an overly expensive resort restaurant with OK food and exhorbitant prices.I've lived here my whole life (28 years, dude) and strangely enough have never been to this place. Well, I finally went here last night with my sexy-pants boyfriend. His pants are sexy.So, it takes a few minutes to get to the actual restaurant. You drive higher and higher and higher and then directly into outer space. Finally, when you arrive to the top, complimentary valet is waiting for you. Which I zipped right past because I refuse to valet my expensive 2011 standard Golf. I probably should've valeted though, because then I was forced to walk up a slanted hill in 6" heels and had to cling to sexy-pants boyfriend like an old lady with brittle bones. Once inside, you then go up yet another flight of stairs (don't worry, there's an elevator) where you are finally greeted by the hostess. The restaurant itself is interesting - large, glass windows so you can enjoy the view, said Captain Obvious. Aside from that, it's rather plain and even on the drab side. I'm not saying that's a negative. It could be purposeful to not retract from the view? I dunno. The view is seriously spectacular though! I love the desert and this only amplified my love for it. I know there's a lot of haters in Phoenix who talk shit about how ugly this city is. You shut your damn mouth. If you're one of these haters, I encourage you to visit places like this that give you a profound appreciation of how neat mountains and clear skies really are.Onto the food: Pretty good! Expensive, as one would expect, but not outrageous. I ordered a "micro greens" salad with pistachios, pears, and some type of cheese I'd never heard of it. The salad was truly micro and was almost deconstructed, which I'm not a fan of. I'm lazy and don't want to put my food together. It came out on an overly-HUGE plate and I nearly guffawed at it! Hahaha! It looked really silly and even tinier. Overall though it was pretty good. I also had a side of fingerling potatoes and those were GREAT! S.P. Boyfriend had the chef's special, which was shrimp with kidney beans (I think, can't remember). It was very tasty. We followed all of that up with the peanut butter and chocolate cheesecake - definitely the highlight of the evening. The entire bill came to $76 - not bad! Afterward we went outside to check out the rest of the restaurant and made the treacherous trek back down to my baller car, where my boyfriend literally piggybacked me so I didn't have to break my ankles.Overall, pretty cool place! Friendly staff, great views. Clearly I have run out of things to say.
Christos Mediterranean Grille=Dirty, unclean, my friend and I went to lunch here.  She went to go to the bathroom. Upon returning to the table had the following story to tell.  To get to the bathroom she had to go through the kitchen and down a flight a stairs. When passing through the kitchen she saw raw chicken left out in the heat congealing in it's own blood.  Christos you get no second chances after a stunt like that.  The food was tasty, but come on now chicken chillen on the counter is a no go in anyone's kitchen.This place is a run down, out dated, hole in the wall restaurant with slow service and creepy decor.. and it's fabulous. When you walk into the Christos, don't expect to be greeted- you won't be (unless someone pulled you in off the street). Plan on walking to the back to find someone who may or may not seat you, or you may be told to sit wherever you want.  I would recommend sitting outside, although not your typical "patio seating" ambience,  it's (in my opinion) the better option. It's teeny tiny and super old school. The menus are old and messy, but you're not eating those anyway, right?So all of that aside, Christos is a really fantastic little family owned authentic Greek place that serves really great food. They serve it slow, but they serve it good!  I ordered the hummus and pita bread as an appetizer  (yummm) and the Greek Pizza as my meal, and it was so good! I really loved it, and you can't beat the prices. My lunch was all of $12, and I ordered a soft drink, an appetizer, and a pizza that came with a salad... and it was good! The point to me pointing out all of the negatives first was that you can't ignore the obvious and pretend it doesn't exist.. truth is, all that stuff is true. But if you're prepared for it and willing to overlook it, you will leave pleased. Just keep in mind that it is a family owned establishment- there's no advertising, no sponsors, no corporate funding.. don't go in expecting top notch service, or hip decorations. But do go in expecting genuine, sincere service and great food. Give Christos a chance, maybe it's your thing and maybe you can't get on board, but I will always look past an exterior for good food and to support a local business!
Girasole Restaurant=What a production! I don't even know where to start...The place is small.  They didn't lie to me when I made the reservation.  Of course we had to pick the busiest day and time, Saturday at 7pm.  The nice lady on the phone told me a reservation helps but we may still have to wait.  I did appreciate that tip from her.  Sure enough, we showed up and it's PACKED!  The unfortunate thing is it was cold, so eating on their patio was not going to happen.  Therefor, people cram into what tiny space is allowed in the front.  But when I say tiny, I really mean no space at all.  An older man pretty much barked orders at us and demanded to know if we had a reservation.  Thank God we did, I was a little scared of him when he ran off muttering about no seating in you ain't got reservations.  So the first table of the restaurant is thee worst, because people are standing on top of you jealously staring down at you and your food.  Of course we ended up with that table!  Thankfully, our server and anyone else helping out was extremely friendly and helpful and made us feel comfortable.  We started with the mussels app.  It came in a light garlic sauce and was a good amount of mussels.  I'd say they were pretty tasty and I loved dipping the bread into the sauce.  The bread actually became my best companion that night... more on that later!I ordered the gnocchi with tomato sauce and mozz cheese.  I LOVE when Italian restaurants dump the sauce on and this was a winner.  I LOVE SAUCE!  I know some people aren't into that, so I'll warn you if you like light sauce, you WON'T be happy.  After having gnocchi at Il Pizzaiolo in South Hills earlier that week (I know, I'm on an Italian kick!) it didn't hold a candle to those light little pillows of pasta and potato.  The sauce though, delicious!  Much to my husbands chagrin, I had a hard time keeping myself from grabbing his plate!  He had the spinach and ricotta ravioli, which I didn't have have a bite of... but the SAUCE.... oh my!  Orgasmic!  I love tomato cream sauce and this was amazing!  I kept dipping my bread into his sauce, with him increasingly getting annoyed.  Did I want to risk a fight for that delicious sauce... maybe!!  It was soooo good!  But the real action took place as we were finishing up our meal.  I had noticed the older dude/owner walking around with a glass of red wine the whole time.  I thought that he was pretty rude, but kinda funny, in a typical Italian way.  Well, I start to sense a commotion beside me and realize the owner and a server are in a heated convo.  Then the older dude screams "get outta here you F*%& A@#hole!" and then shoves him!  Whoa!!  I was shocked a boss would do that to an employee.  Come to find out it's his son.  A woman, who I assume was also part of management (maybe even a family member!), came over to our table and apologized, joked this was normal Italian behavior and offered us free dessert.  I thought that was really nice of her and and appreciated.   I just feel bad because those kind of things take down a business.  The good was great, but witnessing that, you wonder how long you can work like that.  Hopefully the dude can retire to a nice Italian villa with lots of wine instead of screaming at his son in the middle of his restaurant!My girlfriend has been a regular of this place for years and could not wait to take me when I came in town for the Steelers game. We did not make a reservation and showed up on a busy saturday night around 8:45pm fully expecting a long wait. My girlfriend had forewarned me that there will be a wait so when we showed up we just expected to put our names down and go across the street for a drink while we waited. We ended up waiting in the front of the restaurant for ~20 minutes without anyone taking down our name. A few waitresses mentioned that the older italian guy (owner) took down names. We were ignored several times by him as he came up front - no biggie we saw it was busy. An older woman came up to us several times and asked if we had been helped, we replied no, and she reiterated that the older man dealt with the "list". We were fine up through now and were still waiting when the older guy came up to the front and shoved the older woman (his wife?) and proceeded to scream at her for several minutes. The entire restaurant went quiet and was staring at the front of the restaurant (where we were awkwardly standing as well). The older gentleman was screaming that she was always interfering with the list and he was done with it. He kept going on and said that why did she even care about a couple of "out of towners" who will never come back again. (which was even more shocking because my girlfriend was a regular and had regularly conversed with the man many times before). We subsequently left while the man was still screaming at the woman. This was the most absurd display at a restaurant I have ever seen. My girlfriend was extremely upset especially for the physical violence the man was displaying. This was no casual shove but rather a full two handed violent push followed by pounding his fist on the table and screaming at the woman in front of the entire restaurant. Needless to say we will never come back and recommend people boycott a place where the owner treats his (wife/employee) with such disrespect regardless of how stressed he may be on a busy night.I came here with a friend for dunch (is that a thing?) before heading out to a show at the First Niagara Pavilion on Sat.  Given that we arrived shortly after 4pm, I doubted this place would be busy--and it wasn't--which worked out perfectly, in light of this place's size and popularity during normal dinner hours on the weekend.Based on the recommendation of my labmate and other Yelpers, I ordered the spinach and ricotta ravioli, and it didn't disappoint.  The pasta was perfectly tender without being mushy, and the filling was savory and delicious.  As Rachel C. pointed out in her review, this place is quite generous with the sauce, which is great because this was the best part of the dish!  It was a tomato cream sauce that was delicious in its own right, but that complemented the savoriness of the ravioli fillings well.  After finishing my raviolis, I asked for some more bread and used it to sop up the remainder of the sauce.  My dish also came with the Girasole salad--a tossed salad dressed with sunflower seeds (how cute, in light of the meaning of the restaurant's name!)--that served as a great appetizer to the meal.  About the only part of my meal that wasn't noteworthy was the bread, which was fine, but just your standard Italian bread.Since he wasn't as hungry as me, my dining companion ordered the bruschetta, which also came with a salad.  It wasn't your standard bruschetta, however--it consisted of what looked like chopped squash with prosciutto on toasted flatbread.  I'm not sure how much he enjoyed it, since he left a fair amount of the squash and prosciutto on his plate.  However, I wouldn't count this as a strike against the dish or the restaurant, since he can be a pretty picky eater.  I didn't taste the bruschetta in its entirety, so I can't pass my own judgment on it, unfortunately.As others have mentioned, the dining area is definitely small and intimate, and the tables are quite close to one another.  However, this wasn't a problem for us since the restaurant was only about 1/3 full when we were dining, due to being there on an off hour.  We really liked the ambience, which I'd describe as rustic but classy, and it didn't feel like basement dining even though it was.  The waitstaff all seemed quite jovial with one another, which was fun to observe.  I have no complaints about the service we received.Overall, we had a nice experience here, and would definitely return.  Given the popularity of this place, if you want to avoid some of the problems mentioned in other reviews due to the small space, I'd recommend going for lunch or during an off time.  This is definitely one of the better Italian restaurants I've eaten at thus far in PGH, so if you're in the mood for this type of food, give it a try!
In-N-Out Burger=Two words: Doggy, I mean ANIMAL STYLE. (Excuse my adult context, please keep children away from this review.)Anyways, once you go black, I MEAN A-style, there's just no going back, period. ;-OThis is the best upgrade you could possibly do to a burger especially here! Can't believe it took me this long to discover their "secret." The components of ANIMAL STYLE is simple yet genius:+ In-N-Out's thousand island spread (combined with...)+ Caramelized, chopped onions (star of the show)+ Cheese (if not a cheeseburger already)Voila! Now take it down like the Animal you are! Cuz you're rough like that. ;-) It's a little messy but very manageable as you chomp your way through.Wait, there's more! If you like a little kick, say: "chopped chili's" Bam son! You got yourself some heat with that A-style.  Level 2 Complete.  Optionally, you can have a whole, uncut Chili Pepper on the side.Its just not the burger you can apply the A-style to, yes, your fries can get the same treatment.  Unless you like it all sloppy and want to eat it with a fork, I would keep your fries untainted.  Well, there you have it, I hope I was informative and inspiring that you will now go try this "Animal Style" at an In-N-Out near you!
Nico's Recovery Room=Nico's is one of my favorite Yinzer bars.  I've been going here off and on since I turned 21, even if it was just to stop in for fries at lunch, and it's one of the finest dives around.We typically stop in here for a fish sandwich and some drinks after the Unblurred gallery crawl in Garfield.  Jason bartends on Friday nights, and he's the best.  He's one of those bartenders that remembers you after your first visit, and remembers what you drink and keeps the refills coming.Their food is excellent.  The fish sandwich is church-fish-fry good, and the coleslaw is crispy and mayonnaise-d to perfection.  But the real treat of this place is the fries.  There's something about these fries that I just love.  I think they remind me of the homemade fries my grandpa used to make me in his deep fryer when I was a kid.  They're kind of like a thinner, jucy-er version of Potato Patch fries.  Seriously.  Go get some now.And like other dive bars in Pittsburgh, the prices are cheap.  This is the perfect place to sit around with your fellow Yinzers and watch the Buccos or the Pens (or both, if it's that glorious time of year when both seasons are going - they have multiple TVs).The only thing I don't like about Nico's is that it's one of the few smoking-permitted bars left in town (they, like Thunderbird and the Cage, keep the food prices low to skirt that smoking ban loophole).  I've gotten kind of spoiled lately by smoke-free establishments, and I hate coming home stinking like cigarettes.But the dives in Pittsburgh are all pretty much maintaining the smoking thing, so I can't complain when comparing.  All that said, there's no bar I'd rather hang out at than Nico's.  :)
McNinch House Restaurant=So...it's been at least two years since I've been to McNinch and I still remember the experience like it was yesterday. And I have to agree with Bill on this one, it's pretty amazing.Hubs and I decided to try this illustrious resto for Valentine's Day in 2008, we went through the whole reservation process, custom menu, custom wine pairings - the whole shebang. We actually followed all their directions to a t and arrive early, enjoyed some champagne while taking a tour of the sweet little home/restaurant on Church St. And then the incredible began...We were blown away (for the entire 3+ hours) by the spectacular pairings of food and wine, accompanied by fantastic service. I know we saved our menu for quite some time, but I'm not sure where it ran off to. Every single course was creatively prepared and tons of local ingredients were immersed into the dishes. Our server was also extremely knowledgable in each wine, explaining its heritage and vineyard to us. Since we choose the wine pairing option, we quite literally had a different (and interesting) glass of wine with every of the seven courses. Good thing we lived in the Fourth Ward at that time. Hey-oo!McNinch House is such a special place to experience an amazing meal. It's pricey and well worth every penny: I'm still talking about my meal 2.5 years later. We probably spent about $400 all in, including the wine pairings for each of us, seven courses and tip. An expensive meal for sure, but it's wonderful for a anniversary or milestone celebration.Of course I cant afford a real meal here but to feel part of the ELITE I go for the wine tastings!!!  They are almost every other Monday, sometimes they will have them outside but usually they are inside their spectacular dining rooms.  Yes, the house is stunning and historic if you like antiques and victorian style decor.  The wine tastings are $20 bucks per person and include usually 7 or so wines and heavy apps.  You can wander throughout the downstairs or on the peaceful porch with your wine.  It is the perfect Monday happy hour!  Love you McNinch!!!  :-DIll start my review by stating that ive been working in the food industry for 7 years now, all fine dining.  I know what works and what doesnt, and what i should expect when eatting at places. With that being said.My wife and dined here and i was very disappionted with the over all experiance.  I think the thing that bothered me the most was the wine manager, after saying that we would be hving a 6 course dinner and would not be pairing it with the wine but would be ordering individual glasses of wine and cocktails he just lost all interest in providing an enjoyable experiance. After ordering our first drinks and finishing it, a manhattan for myself and champagne for her i was asked if we would like another drink; which i agreed to. instead of bringing out the wine menu again i was made to just state what type of wine i would like, the sommelier brought a glass of cab and just dropped it at the table- no mention of year, make, and region, just a heres a glass of wine, i didnt know if it was a 5 dollar a bottle wine or a 35 dollar a glass wine, nothing. And on top of it all it was corked. Luckally they removed it and took it off the bill, they brought out another and the som just dropped it off again, i had to stop him before he walked away and ask what he just gave us, he repllied a cabernet. I litterally had to prompt him with " where does it come from, when was it made, who makes it."If i could grade just the som i would give him a zero, the man has given up on even trying to provide for his clients.Getting into the food, it was ok not worth what we paid for, the amuse was enjoyable, as well as the duck which was cooked perfectly, but the other 4 courss were average. The smoked sweet potato puree, coupled with the beef and sauce was just way too sweet, totally killed the meat.I think what put the nail in the coffin while eatting here was the check at the end.  They automatically add 20% gratutity to the bill, it doesnt matter what type of service you get. With the staff already nowing they are getting theirs is it any wonder they could care less.Four star 4 diamond yea right.Can't even begin to describe this place.  First off, the house itself is incredible.  A throwback to craftsmanship construction and not a detail left unattended.  Regarding the food, there's not another place in Charlotte that can even come close to it in my opinion.  We were here celebrating and decided on the Chef's Tasting menu which is a 9-course dinner and I'm not going to belabor you all with the details of each and every dish.  I'll just say that the dishes were thoughtful, creative and cooked to perfection with the touch of a culinary artist.The service was impeccable and not once did we feel rushed to finish or hurry along.  When you reserve here, you basically have the table for the night and that's a good thing because our dinner was over the span of 3 hours (slightly more).  We did chat it up a bit with the staff though.Parking is valet only and is directly behind the house.Bottom line, McNinch is a must do for locals and people visiting alike.Long time Charlotte establishment McNinch House is a dining experience, not just a restaurant. Located in a beautiful Fourth Ward Victorian house, you are dining in an elegant setting. Make sure that you really like the person you're with because an evening at McNinch House is an investment in time. Enjoy yourself - do not feel rushed - pace your beverages - dinner will definitely take a while.My dining partner and I chose the four course dinner. There are options that offer additional courses as well as wine parings if you wish. Wine is also available by the glass, bottle and as flights. We chose crab cakes as our first course. When the plates were served, I thought I was seeing two small biscuits on the plate (yes, the lighting is somewhat dim.) The crab cakes were beautiful and wonderful. The two crab cakes were predominantly chunks of crab with very little seasoning, dusted with a soft flour and very lightly browned. They were served with a lightly dressed slaw and the combination was right on. Perfect. Being in a crab state of mind, we chose she crab soup for our second course. The creme fraiche made in house really added to the flavor of this dish. The small addition of sherry was just right.My companion and I parted company with the entree. She had the rack of lamb and I chose the duck breast. The rack of lamb was cooked to perfection, nicely displayed and exactly what she expected. My duck breast was also perfectly cooked. It was served with a cherry reduction and sweet potato hash. For dessert, we chose their evening's cheesecake. Thinking I would receive the normal size portion, I thought I would be wasting much of my dessert. When the plates arrived, I was very pleased to see a beautiful, small portion. The flavor was wonderful. I ate the whole thing! It was just right.With one exception, the food was five stars. Unfortunately I detected a slight burned flavor in the cherry reduction. It was about 30 seconds too cooked. But that was not enough to ruin the whole food experience.My greater concern involved service. McNinch House is a first class restaurant. I didn't feel like the service was first class for these reasons: we arrived about 10 minutes before our reservation time. The door was locked and after a while we were met at the door by one of the servers. We felt awkward when he said for us to wait and look around if we wished. I would have preferred him to take my coat then and offer to take a drink order. The waiting was not a problem, the awkwardness was. Secondly, the servers did not stick with the tried and true rules of which side to serve and from which side to remove plates. In several instances the servers crossed in front of us to remove something from the table in spite of the fact there was plenty of room behind both of us. Lastly, I don't mind an automatic gratuity and I don't object to a 20% gratuity since I normally tip that amount anyway. What I do object to is tipping on the taxed amount. This means I am tipping on more than 20% and I don't think that is right at all.I hope to someday return to McNinch House. I do recommend this restaurant with some reservation (but not the food - it was wonderful.)
40th Street Cafe=I totally expect to see Mel Sharpel's slinging hash in the kitchen with Alice, Flo and Vera, in those cute waitress outfits, tending to the eclectic brood of diners. And while the fictional characters from my past aren't here, you will find some REAL characters. My favorite is the older couples who don't speak to each other but instead read the newspaper. And the trucker guy who says things like "Thanks little lady". Not to be rude, I just batted my eyelashes and said, "Why you're welcome trucker man."  All the servers are women who know their regulars names and what they want. Without fail. Though I"m not much of a pie guy (insert homo joke here), people line up for Peggy's Pies. Me? I'm all about breakfast on the weekends and anything with gravy. Come for the meatloaf, chicken fried chicken or the biscuits but stay for the pie. It's like taking a trip to the midwest without the cavity search at Sky Harbor.I probably wouldn't have come here but for some reason I was reading the Yelp reviews and bookmarked this place. Checked off. Seen this place before and very very unassuming cafe in the strip mall. We walk in and not sure what to expect. One of the waitress tells us to just take a table. So we sit down and there is crumbs on the table. Wife is freaking out (Scottsdale woman)  hahaha. One of the customers gets up and says I will get that cleaned up for you. Man is this place different. It seems something like the 60's or maybe like home. Waitress are just talking to the customers. Joking and everything. Just like home. Not your normal cafe. I ordered the ultimate skillet. It had home potatoes, bacon, ham, sausage, onions, peppers with eggs on top with a side of English muffin. I really love home potatoes. I thought it was pretty good. Tasty, huge portion and filling. Not bad. My wife for the Caesars chicken salad. This was very very different salad than other places we visited. Nice chunks of chicken, bacon, and egg. I was able to sneak a few bites and it was really good. It comes with Texas toast. My wife really liked the salad and toast. Usually she doesn't eat the bread with her salad but not today. She really like it. As for the service, these servers are like your family. Seemed like your aunts or something. Take you order, fills you water glasses and coffee but never asked how everything is cause it's seems like home. Like family. Very homie place. Only talking at this place was with the waitresses. My wife was a little uncomfortable cause it's such a small place that everyone hears your conversations so no one talks too much but with staff. I liked the place. Huge menu. Let's put it this was family atmosphere (your treated like family), good food, huge portions. If you come here just be ready for a different environment. Loved it that on the walls are pictures of veterans. Leave your Scottsdale attitude out the door and just enjoy this different cafe. Enjoy.
Pedro's Mexican Restaurante=Badger game disappointment! Watered down drinks, slow service and rude management! My husband and I have watched many badger games at Pedro's. Good drink specials and multiple TVs have made this our go to spot for years. The service is always slow and the food is just decent but it's a good spot to watch a game...Tonight was a completely different story! My Guinness tasted just like water, I suspect it was watered down. Our service was super slow. We were there for over 30 minutes before we received chips and salsa. The chips were hot but they needed salt. Their salsa tasted like ketchup. Once we ordered, again our food took forever. My cousin asked for sour cream and waited another 20 minutes for it. My food was ok. The tamale was actually pretty good. It needed spice though.The kicker was when the manager, Brett, started changing the channels shortly after halftime! We asked the waitress what was going on. We came for a badger game. Our menus had badger specials, FB also listed their badger specials. Having just received our food... Yes it took two quarters, we couldn't relocate to another establishment. Apparently, there was a UFC fight on. We asked to speak to management, this is when we met Brett.We asked about the game. He refused to turn the game back on stating that they paid $2000.00 for the UFC fight and they were going to show it. I looked around at the sea of red and asked him what his current demographic/ customer base thought of missing the second half of the game. He again referenced the cost. His solution was to have us move tables in the middle of our dinner to be in view of a smaller tv with no sound! Worst of all was when I told him we wouldn't be returning because of this he said,"Ok." He clearly doesn't care about his customers! Awful!
The Village Green=As many yelpers have said perfectly...the Village Green is the idealistic neighborhood tap.  I hadn't been in over 10 years, and walking back in the place looked exactly the same.  Some would call it a bad thing, but I find it endearing.  We've been back a few times now and love going with friends for a casual Friday night.  Great specials (love the Friday fish...but be prepared to eat only fried food).  My all-time favorite is their summer sausage reuben...if you love reubens you cannot go wrong with this jewel!  Fries are always hot and fresh and service is always friendly.  One of Middleton's best kept local secrets!
Wild Thaiger=UPDATE 5/19/2008Finally. Me and the Thaiger are purring like happy kittens. I've discovered their yellow curry at lunch and it is dee lish! Prices are insanely low, tho the lunch menu is limited. Service is upbeat and more polished. Now, a purrrrfect place for me to lunch!!! Hello Kitty!!!!I think Hello Kitty is wildier than this cat. Veggie tempura. I've had crispier wafers from a priest. Pad Thai. Wouldn't say it was bad, but, hmmm, what's the word I'm thinking of, oh, I know BLAND! I've had tastier wafers from a priest. I love the chef. Very approachable and like, totally, super nice. Wait staff, on the two occasions I've been there, were a little inactive. I've had more action from a priest. I'll go again. Try new things. But only after I do the Rosary.3/5/10My second attempt to dine here, as it was so busy the first time (and so noisy!), that I had to leave.  (It was during lunch hours, and I don't like to wait.)  Arrived a few minutes shy of the end of lunch, so I was able to dine in peace.  Ordered the tofu green curry and the fried banana and coconut ice cream for dessert.  I found the portion of the entree to be very skimpy for the price, and I've had much tastier, and creamier, curry sauce elsewhere (Tottie's, Thai Elephant, even Yupha's!).  Need I say more?  Seriously, WT's green curry tastes about the same as Thai Hut's, but at a portion that's about half (or less) of what I could get at TH, or any of the other places I've visited, but I suppose the "atmosphere" is what I'm paying for here?  That said, I must admit that the fried banana dessert was delicious!  Loved the toasted coconut on top (well, on top of the bananas, but under the syrup toppings, coconut ice cream, whipped topping, and maraschino cherry!).  On my next visit, when I'm craving for something sweet, I will ask to have the syrup toppings, whipped cream, and cherry omitted.  The dish is perfect w/out them.I have to say of all the Thai Restaurants that I have ever been to , and there has been a lot. This is my absolute favorite.Every time I walk in here the smell is amazing.For years we have come here,ever since It first opened.It is family owned and every thing is cooked when you order it.It is always good. In all these years I have never once not liked what I have gotten here.We even got food to go from here on New Years Eve! It too was AWESOME!Just thinking about it makes me want to eat here every day, not just Fort nightly.Bathrooms are always nice and clean. Plus lots of parking in the back.Easy to find, right on Central and right next to Durants.This is it! This still stands as my most favorite Thai Restaurant ever! I love the food here. Plus, the minute you walk in the wonderful smell of all the spices is so warm and inviting. It is cosey in here and romantic ,smells great, and has great service. So it is a win, win all the way around.Everything I have ever tried here has been delicious,but my favorite is still the Yellow Chicken Curry.Lots of parking in the back, right next door to Durant's on Central.I LalaLOVE this place!! I've been on this crazy Thai kick for a long while now and after trying so many places that were decent but not too amazing, I found this place! THIS IS MY THAI SPOT now! My friend and I decided to go here for lunch and it was pretty busy. But we were seated quickly and ready to order. We got the spring rolls (1 came with the lunch menu item) which were so delicious and crispy. For our entrees, we got the pad thai and the red curry. Both dishes were amazing. But the pad thai was our favorite, which is a big deal to us since I don't really like pad thai that much. The curry was a little spicy but it was so creamy and flavorful. The veggies were perfectly cooked and the tofu wasn't soggy. The pad thai was loaded with veggies and again the tofu was not soggy. It was such a great dish. Service was good. Our waitress was sweet and prompt. The food is inexpensive for the quality.We can't wait to come back. Oh and I love the name of this place. "The wild THAIger." Rawr! So clever.I was hoping to try the food here before I left the city. Unfortunately, I was turned away at the door, even with empty tables in sight. The hostess informed our party that the restaurant was short staffed and we would have a ten minute wait. No problem. We are patient. With no other patrons waiting to be seated, we requested to sit at a table and would have no concerns about waiting for service while we rested our legs and chatted. We were refused.In 103 degree heat, we were refused. They were unwilling to allow us to sit inside at an empty table to wait! We questioned this action and the hostess turned to the kitchen, then looked back and said she was not allowed to let us inside.We were left with the option of standing in the heat while tables remained empty inside, or we could find a place that was willing to accommodate our party. We chose the latter. I'm sorry that I will never have the opportunity to review the food here. Even more, I am disappointed that the staff behavior was so appalling. The only interaction with the restaurant that I have to review- a refusal to allow us to sit at an empty table.Diners, drive ins and dives listed this place as a MUST try do we did. k so first off let me explain why they didn't receive a 5 star. We came at 8pm on a Fri night and it wasn't too busy for a mom n pop spot. The lighting was HORRIBLE. I understand u want to set the mood outside but if customers tell you more than once that they can't read the menus then something needs to change. They lite a candle but it gave little to no help. We had to use our phones. Another thing we noticed is that the food took SSSOOOO long to come out! Also, by the time the food came out (3 plates at first and then another 10 minutes later) the food was luke warm. It seemed like they had plates ready but waited for the others to come out which made the rest of the food barely warm. Ok on the upside, the presentation of the food was great! We ordered beef pad Thai, tropical chicken fried rice, yellow chicken curry and peanut chicken plate. They were all very good, but the temperature of the food down played it. It all tastes great. We were so Hungry after our softball tourney that we didn't want to send it back since it took so long in the first place. Overall it's pretty good Thai food. Service was good as well. We Had a hard time understanding our waitress but we made it thru. If you're a local come try it.
Michelina's=I really would like to give Michelina's more than 3 stars.  The service, atmosphere, wine, and food were all pretty good.  Michelina herself even came by the table to check on us.  However, for $50 per person, I believe we deserved to be blown away!  We were satisfied, but not blown away...It was a rainy Friday night, and my boyfriend was craving Italian as was the other couple we went out with... They relied on me to choose the restaurant, so I remembered that I enjoyed Michelina's a few months back with some family that was in from out-of-town.  (Please note that I never saw the bill that last time and had no clue how expensive everything was during that visit.)  There were no Yelp reviews yet, so even more appealing, right?  I could be the first!  So, here it goes:Michelina's is hiding in a very unassuming little shopping center off of Shea and the 51.  I would guess that their business is mostly from word-of-mouth because I'd never noticed the location before my first visit nor had I heard of it!  I made a reservation to be safe, but I don't know if we really needed it or not.  Brad was our server and he was excellent.  He took drink orders and recommended 2 appetizer specials:  Eggplant rollatini and Oysters with spinach, ricotta, and bay shrimp in an alfredo sauce.  We took one of each for the table.  Brad commented that we could wait to see if we liked the apps to know if we could trust him or not.  We did trust him - we were all pleased with the appetizers even though I thought the Oysters were a bit heavy.We went with a bottle of Merlot for the table (I don't remember the name of it) and it was good - nothing special, but good.  For our entrees, I went with the escolar special - served on a bed of sauteed spinach; Jared went with the Veal Chop special served with fresh pasta shells stuffed with spinach and ricotta; Deborah took Brad's advice and ordered the Chicken Genovese special; and Jack had the Veal Saltimbocca layered with prosciutto and mozzarella cheese.  (More on entrees coming soon...)This is where the highlight of the meal came in... we were all pleasantly surprised that dinner salads came with our entrees.  There was no mention of this on the menu, so when Brad brought out the salad course, it was an added bonus!  The house dressing was delicious and the salads were basic but fresh and delicious!Back to the entrees... Jared was the most pleased with his (the Veal Chop with fresh shells) - he said it was excellent!  We all had meal envy because the rest of the entrees were kind of bleh - not Worth the $25/$30 for each of them.  Jack and Deborah mentioned after that perhaps our meals would have been better if Michelina added about a cup less salt to each of them!We opted against dessert, but the boys had some coffee/cappuccino and Brad brought us all out a complimentary apertif of amaretto, creme de menthe, and creme de cacao... I don't think any of us were interested, but it was a sweet (literally sweet) gesture.We all left feeling satisfied but not blown away... We won't be rushing back to visit Michelina anytime soon, but if money is not an issue, go check it out and let me know what you think.  Maybe your experience will be worth more than 3 stars!
Tessaro's=The secret in their having one of the best burgers you will ever eat, is in the meat!  They add ground steak including filet mignon!  Another reason why the burger seals in all of those juices plus adds flavor is they are cooked over a 500 degree hardwood grill.Tessaro's was not hard to find, but in a run down area.  They have a parking lot on the side of the building, connected with a grocery store's lot..  The place is small, with a huge bar in the middle.  It was crowded, but we were lucky enough to get a booth.  I was a bit disappointed in their not having french fries, but I tend to fill up on them, so in a way it allowed me to finish that delicious huge burger!I hear they are known for their ribs, as well. The murals are hand painted of the owners and workers and an Irishman and his sister own the restaurant and do the cooking.  The soups are homemade as well.Servers were older and ours was friendly and helpful!  Go and have yourself one of the best burgers you will ever have in your life and add a hot homemade bowl of soup to your check, outstanding!Let me start out by saying, I share food when it's good but I DON'T share food when it's REAAAAAALY good! So I was there with a friend enjoying their fantastic potato salad and she had scarfed hers down in like 5 seconds and her fork was headed towards mine. I stabbed my fork in the same potato she had settled on and yelled NO! And just think, this is JUST the potato salad from here! The burgers are the juiciest biggest most incredible burgers ever! I stick with the cheeseburger because I want to enjoy the burger without any fancy smancy stuff on it. I literally had the first bite of the burger and the juice squirted out the other side. Ok, I know that sounds dirty...but it was SO good!! I haven't strayed much from the burgers, but I did have the tuna melt once and it was good, but nothing compares to the burgers. I mean, that's what you go there for! Plus, my friend saw Russell Crowe there while he was filming a movie in the burgh, so you have to know it's good if his peeps recommended he go there!I have to preface this review with two factors. One, I moved here from South Florida, where the best burgers in town came from your average diners.  They were the last bastion of American food in South Florida, so they served up REAL American food.  If you wanted a real burger, you went to a diner.  After returning to Pittsburgh, I found that every diner here has turned to serving up those frozen gray hockey puck patties and passing them off as burgers.Second, (until the recent explosion of good burger joints in da burgh), I actually HAD been a fan of Tessaro's, until their hostess/manager flat out offended the hell out of me and my party of three.  The result is that I have never, and WILL never return to Tessaro's.My best friend is a 62 y/o blind woman that I met doing theater in the 90's in Pittsburgh.  She lives with her 91 year old mother, and her father (the driver) passed away several years ago.  I don't drive, and rely on the bus system that Steve Bland is intentionally systematically destroying, so any outing that we make must be carefully planned.She and I had met once at Tessaro's.  It was her first time being there.  She took the Access van for the disabled, and I met her there after work via bus.  I walked in, she was seated, having a drink, waiting for me to join her. No problem.  We had a great meal, with an awesome burger.  I can't say enough...they really do have mouthwatering burgers.Months later, we decided to go again, and the plan was pretty much the same.  She took the Access van to the restaurant, and I was going to meet her by bus, and this time a new friend was going to join us, coming by bus from Oakland, and new to Pittsburgh.My best friend called me at 4:30 (we were supposed to meet at 5) and said that her van had come early, and that she was already at the restaurant.  I told her I would get there as soon as I could.  I left work a few minutes before 5 pm, and arrived at the restaurant 5:15.  They were busy, but I was surprised to find my friend still standing in the doorway.  The blind woman had been standing there for 45 minutes.  I made my presence known, and the hostess/manager acknowledged, asked about our other friend. I explained that he was ten minutes away and coming by bus, new to the city, but WAS on his way.  She walked away from us.  We stood in the doorway fro another twenty minutes.Finally, the manager came back, and I caught her attention, and motioned my head toward my blind friend, and asked if we really had to keep waiting?  She'd been standing there in the doorway for over an hour.The next statement sealed the deal on us never returning to Tessaro's.  The manager slapped her hands on her hips, and started barking:"LOOK!  We don't have many rules around here!  In fact, we only have ONE, that you don't get seated until your whole party is here!"And THIS is what really sealed it:The woman thrust her thumb in my BLIND friend's direction, who had only been to Tessaro's ONCE before in her life, with me, and said:"And SHE oughta KNOW that!"She oughta know that?  Exactly HOW should she 'know that'? The only other time she'd been there, she arrived before me, was seated, waited, and I joined her.Additionally, the 'rule' was posted...on a piece of 8 1/2 by 11 copy paper, taped to the wall at the end of the counter, behind several rows of water pitchers.  I couldn't see the 'rule'...a blind woman certainly wasn't going to 'see' it!Finally, after another ten minutes standing there, the manager 'allowed' us to take a table and wait for our friend, who came five minutes later.  We ate our meal, paid our bill, and we left.And we will NOT return.You can treat me badly, and if there's something I really love about your business, I might come back.  But do NOT badmouth a blind woman, or anyone else for that matter, who is disabled, and in need of a slight amount of extra consideration.Tessaro's, you might make good burgers, and you'll continue making a fortune off them.  And I'm sure you really don't give a crap about how your manager treated this lady.  But we will NOT drop one dime more in your restaurant.  We'll take our business to Burgatory.I know, it's a Pittsburgh institution and we're supposed to rave about it and declare it the "best in the burgh". It's not. Not even close. I've eaten there many times in the hopes that maybe I missed something. Maybe it was me. Oh but it's not. It's not me. It's just not that good. Over hyped, underperformed. Burgers are adequate - nothing special. Order something other than a burger and you don't get much better. Years ago it might have been worthy of its reputation since there weren't a lot of competitors. Now, forget it. Burgers are ubiquitous and great ones are everywhere. Best burger in the city is at Kaya - the Kaya burger. Tessaro's - a fading icon of days gone by.  Enjoy the crowds, convince yourself your getting the best, that you're in the know. You're  not.This is not only the best burger in Pittsburgh. It's also the best burger in the USA. Cooked to perfection. The home fires are off the hook too. There is other stuff on the menu but stick with the burgers. Great eats. When in Pittsburgh I will make time for a stop at Tessaro's.Tessaro's is a Pittsburgh classic, and it feels like a classic, old school place when you walk in.First, the whole "this is not the best burger in Pittsburgh" comments... it's also a lot less expensive than a lot of the burger places in Pittsburgh.  This is not the kind of place you come for a million toppings.  This is a straight up, non-fancy, large burger.  It's not trendy, and it probably never will be.Otherwise, I came here and personally ordered a whiskey sour and a cheesesteak with coleslaw.  The whiskey sour was spot on, and the alcohol content was spot on as well.  The cheesesteak was great, not particularly traditional, but great nonetheless.  The steak was tender and there was plenty of it.  Lots of cheese.  No complaints!  My parents' meals were great too!If you need some meat and friendly service in your life, Tessaro's is a great place to stop.
5 & Diner=The Groovy P. and I ventured to his old stomping grounds for lunch today.  The '5 and Diner' on 16th St and Colter left me with little to ask for.  Before coming here I had a preconceived notion that 5 & Diners were dirty and nasty. Not the case at all.We walk in and let the waitress know we want to sit outside (since it's so nice and they had misters).  We get two different servers bringing us stuff (talk about service) and I ask the one waitress for recommendations.  I didn't listen to her, of course, and ordered the Southwestern Burger w/ coleslaw and started with a nice stack of rings.The Onion Rings were perfectly cooked.  They looked like they were prepackaged, but they were very crispy and I could actually bite through the onion without pulling the entire thing out (don't you hate that?!!!)The Southwestern Burger was order Medium Rare and was cooked accordingly.  Soft, juicy, and pink with a nice crispy browned outer layer that can only be achieved on a well used grill.  The creaminess of the chipotle mayo paired beautifully with the green chiles.  Unfortunately, because I ate too many onion rings, I couldn't finish my burger.  What a shame!The Coleslaw was just how I like it.  It's hard to find a really good coleslaw.  I prefer mine to be slightly sweet, not sour.  Too much vinegar in slaw ruins it in my opinion.  This slaw had the perfect marriage of mayo, vinegar, and sugar. Not to mention carrots...My experience here was great!  The servers were top notch and kept my water full the entire time and actually chatted with us for a few minutes.There is an artist guy named Ross who has been there every day for 5393 days straight. No, not an employee.  He goes there and does his art! He hasn't missed a SINGLE day!!! That's like... 15 years! So if you wanna seem to be 'in the know' ask where Ross is... They'll be able to tell you.Time for a nap!Mmmmmmmmmmmmmm........................ Just thinking about this place makes my mouth water!!! The Atmosphere just puts me in another time ... the interior/exterior.... the staffing attire... the music.... uh its great... the service is nice... they are very nice, out going and attentive... but give you your space... its perfect.... the food was awesome!!! i had a burger... OMG i couldn't even finish it, it almost felt criminal...it was sooo good! and their fries are yummy too... i have this insane obsession of eating almost everything with BBQ sauce and usually i would pass on ordering it in most places because... well it always tastes funny or really watery... but in case you looove BBQ sauce to... it was great! lol The pricing on their menu is a pricier than Denny's.... but not by much, and the shake up in our reg Dennys routine is defiantly worth it :)Mmmmmm My roommate and i showed up around 8pm.... it was pretty busy.... but we were seated right away.. and our waitress.. Barbie Doll (according to her name tag) was so nice! my roommate had a pumpkin shake... AMAZING!!!! also had the biscuits and gravy with eggs and bacon... she didn't like it all to much.. (shes a very picky eater) the B&G would have tasted better to me if they didn't put paprika over if... I had their Hound Dog... a pretty nice sized hot dog, the bun toasted... and you could add on chili, cheese or sour kraut!!! I had extra sour kraut and mustard on it! :) mmmm hit the spot... and their Fri's are sooo yummy!! and their BBQ sauce is super good too :) we both decided to have a slice of their cheesecake.... I had strawberry topping.. it was alright.. i wish they had had cherry toppings... mmm.. but this cheesecake was amazing!!!!!!!!! so creamy and a really nice sized piece ... i cannot wait to have it again!! :) Barbie Doll was very attentive and helpful... no where near annoying... at all!! i loved it... and all the other waiters that passed by were lovely as well.. all smiles.. but not the fake kinds... i liked it..
Beto's Pizza=Good stuff. It's places like this that make me almost interested in moving out of sunny Southern California and into Pittsburgh. We don't have pizza like this here.I've been to back to Pittsburgh like 10 times and I've stopped by here every time.A couple cuts of cheese pizza will fill you up. Yummy,Don't order extra cheese. A normal cut will have more than enough cheese.
Julio G's Tatum=Thought my carnitas was on the dry side but the chips/salsa were delish and my strawberry marg was freaking strong.  It was really difficult to Christmas shop afterwards.
La Tolteca Mexican Foods=When someone says "Lets get Mexican for breakfast... there is this place on 12th street and Van Buren...." my stomach takes a dive and common sense tells me that it's probably not a very good idea, but I was in an adventurous mood and Dallas G. is normally always spot on with his restaurant choices, so I decided to give it a whirl. Um... hell yeah! La Tolteca was awesome! Any place that has a full on Mexican bakery staring you in the face when you walk in is fine by me! I was lovingly admiring the watermelon shaped cookies from afar. I will be back... my stomach said. We got up to the menu board and I was impressed with the huge selection of items they had to offer. Honestly, if you cant find something that gets the juices flowing here, you have some seriously demented taste buds. I opted for the egg and cheese burrito with pico and a side of beans and rice. I slathered on the green sauce from the salsa bar and munched away at the deliciousness as the sweat poured down my face. This was one spicy, but tasty, breakfast! D.G. got the huevos rancheros. I didn't try them, but they looked pretty damn good and he seemed to be enjoying them. He also opted for the horchatta, which I normally don't like, but was pleasantly surprised with. Another thing I really want to point out is that the people that work here are REALLY nice, even to us whities. Normally I do not get such a welcome reception, but honestly, the workers were dancing and singing to the festive tunes and even the lady at the pick up counter had a smile on her face. I planned on hitting up the bakery for that watermelon cookie, but my $6 breakfast burro, rice and beans had me FULL... so I will be back for you my little cookie.. yes... I will be back!!!"Eat when you're hungry and eat 'til you're happy"...one of the rules I live by:)One of the simpler rules, really...so much less difficult to deal with than other rules:* "Neither a borrower, nor a lender be" - sure, great advice when the economy is in the crapper, but you might want to think about levering up in boom times:)* "Do not covet thy neighbor's wife" - Hey, if I hadn't done a little coveting, the Beautiful Carin would not be my blushing bride today:)* 9.80665 m/s2 = 1G - It's not just a good idea, it's the law (probably...in this universe:)And so it came to pass that I was, in fact, hungry after my run and before I hit the driving range yesterday...one of my buddies called and suggested La Tolteca.I said "Who?"...The Toltec?But Wes seems to know his Mexican food and I seem to enjoy decent Mexican food, so off I went...to a really interesting part of town:)I guess I don't get out much...hookers ambling up and down the street at 11:30 am?...People urinating behind dumpsters in the parking lot?...The unmistakable (and appetite enhancing) aroma of ganga being smoked nearby?I don't see much of that from my deck in Old Town:)I also don't get tamales that are this good in Old Town, either...m'mmm, m'mmm good...with a great big side of atmosphere:)I chose wisely and thoroughly enjoyed my number 3...two plump, succulent and spicy beef tamales, covered with red sauce...I added a couple of little plastic cups of habanero salsa to my Styrofoam plate and headed for a table in the well muraled dining area (the murals really are nice...an artistic depiction of life on Van Buren, near La Tolteca...bright and colorful:)BTW, La Tolteca is a market and bakery, too!If you happened to want...oh, say a beer or 4 at lunch, you can swing through the market and pick up a six pack of Bud for about what you'd pay for one beer at Loco Patron...and after lunch, you can grab a cupcake on your way out for about 95 cents (about 3% of what you'd pay for a crapcake at Sprinkles:)Wes and I chatted and ate...the tamales were excellent...the company was excellent...I was charmed, by both La Tolteca itself (a sweet little outpost) and by the grittiness of this stretch of Van Buren (a street that gives us all a glimpse of how a post apocalyptic world might look).It was worth the trip, for the food, for the look into another world and for a chance to catch up with my pal:)Go during daylight hours...park in the very safe "hooker patrolled" parking lot...avert your eyes from the public urination ("ma'am...that's really not appropriate":) and have a super burrito or a couple of tamales at La Tolteca...eat 'til you're happy:)
Croque Famous Sandwiches=We had a coupon at work - buy one 6", get one free.  Believe it or not, 6" is plenty for this lil girl! ;}I got the #5 sandwich, which was turkey with cheese and cranberry.  There are two different breads to choose from and two different dressings.  I had the whole wheat bread and the garlic dressing.  They have the sandwich menu split into regions of the world, which I thought was cute, though then the number selection of the sandwiches was off.  It affected my OCD, but not too much!This was one of the best sandwiches I've had in this area!  I'm in the Scottsdale Airpark and surrounded by restaurants.  Most are just trendy places that people go to, just to say they've been there.  And they suck, for the most part!So, the sandwich was ooey-gooey and delish!  I had sauce running down my arm and cheese sliding out the sides.  That's how we do it on the East Coast, yo!  Oh, and a cranberry popped out onto my "shelf" (the chest, dudes!) but didn't stain, luckily.  5-second rule, right?Anyway, with the coupon, my co-worker and I paid $3 for 6"!!!I have ordered from here on several different occasions and had the pleasure of eating at the actual restaurant once.  I usually order the #1 Madame:  ham, salami, egg, tomato, mozzarella & lettuce with extra garlic sauce on the side.  I always order the small which is 6" and $5.99.  The sandwich is actually quite large and makes me really full.  It is soooo good and tasty. I think the garlic sauce is what makes it a home run for me.  I've also ordered the Bulgoki Bowl $7.99.  It's not like complete authentic bulgoki meat like you would get in a ma/pa restaurant, but it does the job considering there aren't any Korean restaurants in the area.  Today I ordered the Albacore Tuna Salad Wrap $6.79.  And once again, I was extremely satisfied with the wrap.  The tuna was juicy and not dry and it was mixed with the garlic sauce which was fantastic.  Delivery has always been quick and the driver friendly. I definitely will continue to order from them during my lunches.
Giuseppe's on 28th=I suck. I've been going to this strip mall for many, many years and always thought "I need to check that place out".   I finally went and it was so simple and good I be a regular form now on I promise.Had the brochettes, all were very good. Not "oh my f'ing God" good but yet very solid.  The lentil soup was fresh and full of vegetables.I had the bolonanase (sp?) ragu.  Past with meat sauce but oh so much more when it came to the taste.  I cleaned my plate.Keep in mind this place is BYOB. You sit on plastic chairs. and there are only about 8 tables in this tiny strip mall location.Nice.I try not to throw around 5-stars out like gang signs, because I really want to reserve the primo ratings for places that really knock my socks off. But, Giuseppe's is quite deserving of the highest rating because it really is a gem of a place. Voted New Times Best of Phoenix Neighborhood Italian (2003), veal (2004) and BYOB (2005), Giuseppe's certainly has earned such accolades. However, in all fairness, I must say I do not live in the neighborhood nor did I have the veal. But, I'll most definitely be trying the veal. And since I went with Robert M, you should know that BYOB is a given. Well, honestly, since I showed up it's almost certain that I'm carrying some form of alcohol on my person. After watching a decidedly emotionally-charged movie at Camelview (The Boy in the Striped Pajamas, an amazing must-see even though a key element in the film is grossly misleading--PM me if you've seen it and I'll share) Robert M and I needed to do something to appreciate the goodness in life so we decided to devirginize ourselves of the Giuseppe's experience. It was about 4:45 p.m. on a Saturday and we were seated immediately. Tucked into a strip mall, it immediately reminded us of the set-up of Pizza A Metro. After reviewing the menu, Robert walked over to Sprouts for wine and we ordered three bruschetta (slow-cooked pork ribs with tomato & melted mozzarella, pesto &fresh tomato and chevre & marinated sun-dried tomatoes) that were all extremely delicious. The bread remained firm and not soggy, yet not so hard that it hurt your teeth or cut the roof of your mouth. We also split the lasagna which was made with fresh pasta and plated with the most divine "gravy" [for all the Italians, although I'm Irish] that we've ever tasted. So *smooth* and not bitter or acidic or sweet or anything less than heavenly. If I could bathe in this, I would. But, since I'm not a splosher... :blush: If only I wouldn't have eaten so much popcorn in the hour before going to Giuseppe's, I would have indulged in so much more. But, alas, I have found a reason to take this Avenue kid back to the Streets: Giuseppe's.Should have listened to the numerous negative reviews on-line (and there were many) but we trusted Guy from Diners, Drivins & Dives ...BIG MISTAKE. Clue #1 Strip mall with huge cheesy banner boasting "Food Network" endorsement. Clue #2  Self serves sign-in waiting list, apparently, the slimy owner was too busy gushing over customers trying to eat but steering clear of unhappy ones.  Misters and drinking water would have been a nice touch to make the 10-20min 104 degree wait more bearable. The minute we saw the paper table cloths and plastic chairs,cups & utensils we were in trouble. One waiter frantically tried to service the whole restaurant, which was a complete zoo. Now according to Triple D, the pasta was homemade....aaaaaah.....not so much.... Ive been to Italy, I know the difference.  Cut to the chase, $27.00 for two a la carte / appetizer sized entrees.Seems to me, his only goal is cashing in on the TV appearance as quickly as possible with no concern to repeat business...Don't waste your time and money....On a positive note, Guy was right about Matts Big Breakfast in downtown Phoenix, great good and the best costumer service we've ever had.Really?! Who else finds it incredibly tacky that they added "As seen on food network" on their sign? Me thinks that a visit from Guy has made your head big. I enjoyed the food here before Guy visited. Now the service is rude, the prices are sky high and the food quality is down. I have given them the benefit of the doubt and eaten here a couple of times after the Guy visit. Every time it has gotten worse. I would much rather go to La Piazza Al Forno. The meatballs were small and tasteless, the sauce was very sweet. The lasagna used to be really good here but the last 3 times it has gotten smaller and costs more and the flavor is disappearing with the portion size. Overall to pricey for what you get. Again that sign is just plain old tacky and is enough of a reason to make me go elsewhere. In my opinion a stupid move. Maybe Gordon Ramsey should visit and give Giuseppe a much needed reality check!I find these 5 star reviews to be incredibly suspicious. We just got back from returning our ***70 dollar take-out order*** (which consisted of 2 gnocchi, 1 bolognese, and 1 linguini and clam sauce, by the way) to a very rude and egotistical owner. We called beforehand to merely voice our concerns about this incredibly expensive, yet mediocre meal. The owner answered the phone and was not only unconcerned, but was very argumentative, saying that he "only gets a complaint once every 2 months" and that he has a "packed house." He made us feel like our opinions didn't matter in the least bit. He begrudgingly told us to bring our food back for a refund, so we did just that. When we arrived, he met us outside and argued with us a bit more, emphasizing that his 20 seat restaurant was full. When we tried to explain our concerns with the food, he said "whatever" and left, shortly returning with our refund.Food:-Clam and fettuccine-far too salty-Tomato sauce- tastes like canned-Gnocchi-mushy, no texture-Bolognese-no flavorBottom line:-Rude, arrogant owner-Bland,over-priced food-Never returning!!I really didn't want to have to write this review, since I live in the neighborhood and want this place to be good. Before it appeared on Food Network, although expensive, this place was quite good. I just don't want anyone else to waste their time and money when there are so many other good Italian restaurants to eat in Phoenix. (e.g. Aiello's)The food is so-so to average ....... and then it falls off the cliff .......                             The prices are OVER-THE-TOP !!!!       *This is an EGO DRIVEN Restaurant       *Signs all over the place ....... about The Food Network       If you have an yen for an OVER-RATED experience ....GO                    You won't be disappointedTucked in a small hole in a strip mall, this little place actually serves really good food! It was on DDD for a reason!  Small but with charm and a really pleasant women behind the counter for lunch, we ordered and shared a meatball sub and italian sausage with sweet peppers sub. We also started with the prosciutto and melon. The appetizer was amazing, just like I got in Italy. The sandwiches were both fantastic, I am still trying to decide which was my favorite. They had plenty of cheese and sauce and were falling apart and messy and yummy just the way a saucy italian sandwich should be!They have ice tea and a variety of soda's and italian sodas but they are in a can fyi. Tables are a little close but the food was worth at as well as the service. We did have a local dines voucher for half off the meal but the prices were really great. We really felt like we got out money's worth and would go back in a second without the coupon.  I will be back to try many more things on their menu!Well I held out on writing a review based off my 1st experience,  which was two weeks ago.  I called in a order to carry out.  I ordered shrimp fettuccine Alfredo with fig and marscopone purchtuo burchettas. When I got home it was terrible.  The pasta is home made so it's super thick.  Four small shrimp and hardly no Alfredo sauce, I mean dry. That fake bruccetta is hard and dry.  So I called a spoke to Cindy and explained that I lived far from the location.  It practically took me an hour to get there and I couldn't come back.  So she put the owner in the phone and we worked out a deal that I would get a $27.00 credit the next time I came in. Fast forward to today which was a couple of weeks later. When I arrived Cindy wasn't there but the owner Richard was.  So I explained who I was and he remembered. So he said I can give you a $17.00 credit because you ate the meal didn't you?  I didn't even touch that dry mess. So being pressured and embarrassed of what the phone conversation was and what he was saying to my face and the place was packed and I didn't want to argue.  I just ordered their signature dish, the Osso buco to- go again. So the waiter rang me up and I ended up paying them about $15.00 additional dollars.  I was pissed off. But I figured well maybe it will be worth it.I get home and make nice salads for me and my husband to accompany the meal still with high hopes because it looks good and the meat is falling off the bone. So we eat it with disappointment.  The sauce is tasteless I mean no flavor at all the bread was dry.I will never return. I will go to Olive garden which I far better than this place. Or just wait to go back to New York and eat authentic Italian at Carmine's or Rao's in Vegas. Or for great bruccettas go to Postionos.I don't know why this place is crowded.  The food is bland and it's so tiny.  I have been to several DDD destinations this one is a BIG miss.
Cracker Barrel Old Country Store=We had a gift certificate for Crackle Barrel and so we decided to try this place. I walked in and confusion. It's a real country store with a bunch of old stuff hanging down from the ceiling. Looking for where to go then as you look at the back of the store and you see the hostess stand. Thank goodness. The place is packed and it's like a very homey country place with lots of old country pictures and plaques. I got the menu and again confusion. Huge menu for lunch and dinner with another menu for breakfast (they serve breakfast all day). So going through both menus is tough. I started out with their raspberry lemonade in a frosted mug. Really good, fresh and I loved it. I had the fried catfish with Mac & cheese, fried okra, and hash browns. Oh yea forgot to tell you, you get to pick three sides with your meal. The catfish was ok. A little dry. The mac & cheese was ok. Not great. Okra was a little moist. Not crispy like it should be and the hash browns were ok. Not a great meal but ok. Also, they bring out muffins and cornbread muffins. I've had better cornbread. Not great. So I would say my meal was just ok. My wife had the apple cider vinegar BBQ chicken. She loved it. It was very moist and the sauce was excellent. She was talking about it in the car. Haven't heard her talk about a meal like that before. I grabbed a little bit and it was very good. Loved the sauce. My son had the chicken fried steak and it was pretty good. No complaining from him. The service was good. It took awhile for our server to greet us but understandable because the place was so busy. She did get our drinks and refilled us when we needed it. She was pretty good and friendly. So the place is loud with people eating and enjoying themselves. Lots of families. There was music playing but I think it was. some country music. The food was okay to really good. I guess I just ordered the wrong thing. I did notice everyone ordering breakfast and the blueberry pancakes and French toast looked really good. So next time it's breakfast. Service was good and a real family atmosphere. Like I said I will probably be back but order from the breakfast menu. Enjoy.When I walked in, I felt like I've been here before. I never really paid attention to this before but they have a quite few locations in Arizona alone and they are everywhere in the United States. I must have went one of them somewhere in east coast.Based on the decor of the restaurant, I wanted to eat biscuits and gravy with side of grits. I was on my way to some hiking, I wanted a lot of calories. Old timer's breakfast comes with biscuits and gravy (so many of them, couldn't finish what was served), small side of grits, (thinking how grits tasted as I write my review, now I remember last time/place I went to a Cracker Barrel. Interesting how food brings back memory), hash brown casserole, and sausage patties. It all tasted how the restaurant is decorated.I also tasted fried Apple, it wasn't as sweet as I anticipated, just natural Apple sweetness, it would be perfect to use it for Apple pie. I ate two off my friend's plate but I actually wanted to eat all. Next time I will just order my own.Service was good. She was very friendly and efficient. We were there at 7am on Sunday and they weren't busy but based on how restaurant was set up (chairs outside), I bet they get really busy during peak time. How efficient she was, she looked like she's been working there for a while. I didn't feel we were rushed, she was just good at what she was doing.
The Great Wall Of China South=If you speak Mandarin, you can request whatever Asian cuisine your heart desires.  Bliss!  Since my Chinese is about as rocky as a kindergarten students', I like to drag my parents with me.  We always order up a storm- not exactly sure how to translate the dishes ordered but I'm sure you get the point.  This is as authentic as authentic gets in Charlotte (even some of the foods on the regular menu).  Absolutely love the owner, the wait staff, and the food.Step out of your comfort zone.  That's how you'll get to experience the authentic.  Junk like sweet and sour chicken is not authentic.  Have fun!
Arriba Mexican Grill=3.5 stars. If you must do a chain Mexican restaurant in Phoenix, then Arriba is your place.   Don't bother with Macayo's, Ajo Al's, etc.  Sure it's not the best, but when you want full-service and don't want the uppity Barrio Cafe type of place or the counter-service La Tolteca type of place, Arriba is good for that.The servers are always friendly, the atmosphere inside is more gawdy than its busted bright Vegas jumbotron on its exterior sign on Camelback -- but is to be expected -- and the chip/salsa stand thing is righteous.  We were in there and out of there for dinner last Thursday in under 40 minutes (a measly 10 minute wait for our food) and under $30.While I sometimes order the White Sands Chimichanga adorned with a creamy white cheese sauce and a mini New Mexico state flag toothpick, the Pollo al Diablo is my favorite and features a grilled chicken breast covered with fiery Hatch chile and monterey jack cheese.  It's one of their more well known dishes and is not for novices.  I am not responsible for your indigestion or hyperventilations.  Just sayin.*pffffffft*  That's how you spell the sound of a fart.  And that's exactly what I did for 2 days this week, after my trip to Arriba.It's basic Mexican fare.  We had a group of about 12 and they were great taking care of us.  I never had to ask for my iced tea to be refilled.  The food?  We made a list at work ahead of time and ordered it right before we left the office.  I ordered the fish taco dish.  It came with a side of refried beans and rice.  The beans were nasty and then I realized they probably weren't vegetarian, so I only had a bite and put them aside.  The rice was...rice.  The only way it had any flavor was because I had doused it with hot sauce.  The fish taco?  No flavor!  The fish was grilled, but I could barely taste it.  Everything was covered in some sort of white sauce and it was all that flavorful, but still covered up any flavor that *could* be in the fish taco.  I still prefer Two Hippies.The service was great, but it was really the only thing memorable.  I doubt I'd go back there.  *pffffffffffffft*
Gallagher's Sports Grill=Way to go Cards!!! My party consisted of 25 screaming Cardinal fans.( I had made reservations 3 days prior) So, when we walked in our table was readyand our waitress was standing there to take our drink order! Every aspect of our experience was spot on!!! The Nacho's were Da Bomb! We never had to wait for anything! Here is the one downfall... there are T.V.s in the Men's  room but not the woman's... what the hell.... I jokingly complained and the management said for you it will be rectified!  Gallagher's you complete me!! We will be back! And when College football starts again we will be turning this into a "buckeyes" bar!Although I love Gallagher's and this is my neighborhood standby for a quick and easy frothy adult beverage with friends, I was first leaning toward giving only four stars -- mainly because the quality of the "fresher" elements of the food (i.e. lettuce, jalapenos, etc.) is not especially consistent. But, after thinking about what I would include in my write up I decided I have to go with five stars. Here's why: *FREE cookie sundae with the purchase on an entree on Sundays (Half-baked Chocolate Chip, White Chocolate Macadamia Nut or Peanut Butter with Chocolate Chip cookie topped with 3 scoops of vanilla ice cream and chocolate syrup. You can mix it up with two and go 1/2 and 1/2!) *Build your own burger - not only can you pick your "meat" but you can pick your "bun" and your bun can be a bed of lettuce allowing for less guilt over the fries. I'm partial to the Greek Burger (topped with feta cheese, diced tomato, black olives, and a side of cucumber sauce) made with a turkey patty on a bed of lettuce. *Karaoke on Saturday nights and, if you want, you'll easily get to sing more than once! (I, however, do not sing. I'm pretty sure I could get paid NOT to sing -- even at karaoke. I like to watch and make requests!!) * Generally not a problem getting a seat and TVs are EVERYWHERE! But, when it really counts, Gallagher's graciously took a reservation for the play off game and, actually had "Reserved For..." signs on the tables. The manager was very courteous, even when some of our group were slow to arrive. For this, Gallagher's has secured its place as my "#1 go to watch a game" spot for all time. P.S. If your preference is "fake cheese" nachos, as mine is, then hands-down these are the best nachos in the Valley. (If you like real cheese on your nachos, you are on your own!!)Damn you Yelp for your no half stars~!~!!!!!!! I guess I will have to write the review and then decide between 3 and 4 after I brain dump. I have been to Gallagher's twice now. The first time for Saturday night Karaoke, and the second for the final playoff game (Go Cards!). Over the span of those two visits, I have tried quite a few items. The nachos are really, really good. They use nacho sauce versus shredded cheese, which I happen to think is pretty tasty. However, the salad I ordered left quite a bit to be desired. I kept getting the crunchy gross part of the lettuce head so only half of my salad was edible. The cookie sundae was pretty damn good, as well. I have also had the cheese crisp which I have no complaints about. Perhaps the BEST thing about this place is the $3 well drinks. I am used to paying $5-$9 for a damn vodka tonic, so I was pleasantly surprised when I paid under $10 for three drinks! Now, service here is another story. I'm sorry to say that both times it has left something to be desired. I completely understand that the place was packed on a football day, but the whole place was reserved in advance so I feel like they should have been more prepared. I had to ask for limes three times, and waited twenty minutes to get one. It also took almost forty minutes to get my damn nachos when I first showed up. Another flaw? They put bacon/chicken on my salad, even though I specifically said no meat... and had previously told the waitress I was vegetarian (when I ordered nachos). Oooooo now that I think about it... the very worst part of my experience was that we were seated near the patio, so every time someone opened the door the cigarette smoke rushed in. My eyes were watering and I was coughing the whole time. It was pretty uncomfortable, actually. Overall Gallagher's is a pretty good sports bar with relatively good food and great priced drinks, but there are definitely some service issues. Damn.... I still can't choose between a 3 and 4 .... I know I will be back ... I'm going with 3 and if I'm impressed next time, I will update :)Your basic neighborhood sports bar.  Been here a few times over the last few years and what can I say. The beer is cold, the food is basic bar food. Don't expect much and you won't be disappointed.That's it.
Taste of India=Let me explain to you something. I didn't know, until I moved 12 hours away from here, what a magical place Taste of India really is. I also didn't know, that when I fly into Pittsburgh, I would directly be driving from the airport to pick up take out before seeing my family. Helllooo! Here is your daughter you haven't seen in over a year, she comes reeking of curries and spices every-single-time! Can we start with the fact that the service here is spectacular?! My friends and I have been coming here for years. The owners are cute and funny and we are terrors when we are there because we bring large parties and we are so excited to order an entire table of plates.What fills our table? Booze, yes, they have beer.Bread: Chapatti (Yummy Whole Wheat Goodness!)Veggie Options:Paneer Jalferji (Cheese and Veg)Dal Sag (Lentils)Paneer Makhni (Cheese and Peas)Chana Masala (Duh)*Personal Fav: Malia Kofta (These little fried vegetable balls with creamy tomato sauce and almonds!) --Haven't found this one anywhere else as good as theirs! Ah! I am drooling thinking of it. What do they do to this freaking food? I just don't know. Go soon! Ask for spice level of 7-8 if you want to tantalize your taste-buds with some fiery food and if you would like to ship me a container of the Malia Kofta I will be more than happy to message you my address.....Oh, and my favorite date in Pittsburgh? Taste of India and dancing at Brillo Box. So iconic. So Pittsburgh.Rubbery, nearly raw, white outside, pink inside chicken in two different buffet dishes. I hope they looked at my plate to try to figure out why i simply got up and left, but in my opinion, if you are incompetent enough to put an entire serving tray of undercooked poultry out on a lukewarm steamtable, then anything I can try to explain about what was wrong, will likely fall on deaf ears anyway.
Prairie Cafe & Bakery=I used to love this place - I came here once every week or two for breakfast and to sit and write for an hour or two (I'm a grad student working on my thesis). The food is expensive (~$12 for two eggs, toast, bacon, coffee) and the coffee isn't great, but the atmosphere is nice and I didn't come all that often so it seemed like sort of a luxury. The staff also isn't particularly outgoing, though not downright rude... until today. Today is Sunday, and I arrived around 8am. I usually try to get there kind of early and leave before it gets busy so I'm not taking up a table. I bought a big breakfast (as described above) and sat down to work. Just over an hour later, I was approached by a middle-aged man whom I assume is the owner or manager but whom I've never seen before. He asked if I was aware of their "new policy" about Wi-Fi on Sunday mornings, and how they don't want people just hanging out using the internet when it gets crowded. (No sugar coating, that's almost verbatim what he said.) For the record, I wasn't actually using their wi-fi, I was writing. Whatever. His point was obvious. I stared at him for a few seconds because I couldn't believe that a proprietor was actually asking me, a paying customer, to leave when I had been there only an hour and in fact still had toast on my plate. He suggested it was fine for now but that when it started to get crowded I should get out. I said that if that's how they felt I would leave now, and he responded, "That's exactly how we feel." I was shocked, and still am. I have never, NEVER been treated so disrespectfully in a place of business. And I'm a regular, paying customer!! I always leave a tip! I still can't believe I was treated this way.I will no longer recommend this place, now that they've shown their true colors. If the food was exceptional I might try to swallow my pride, but it's really nothing special. There are several other breakfast/coffee shops in the area (including a Starbucks across the road) and I will be patronizing them instead from now on.
Tony's Italian Delicatessen=Aside for the enthusiasm that the owner has for the store that place was complete crap. I ordered spaghetti and meatballs with garlic bread and salad. the salad was bag greens and 3 cherry tomatoes with a little tiny packet of ranch.The spaghetti was overcooked in a half inch of water, the sauce had no flavor once so ever, and it came with one, smaller than a cue ball, meatball, almost flavorless meatball. more like a mush ballThe garlic bread was awesomeI also purchased a small jar of pesto recommended by the owner. I opened it just to put on my pasta because it had no flavor. I don't even think I'm going to eat the pesto as it wasn't that good either. There was what appears to be a homeless man rubbing through the trash looking for food. He was more than happy to eat my leftovers that I was unhappy with. Perhaps next time I should get a sub.The pesto was tossed out after the weekend...99 percent full.
Morton's The Steakhouse=The last time I ate at a Morton's was in Houston, TX, so I was very excited when BJ suggested that we dine here Saturday night. Had a 7:30 pm reservation, was greeted promptly and led to a comfy corner booth. The restaurant was very busy. Our server Georgeann was very friendly and hit it off right away with BJ. The two of them kept me entertained all night long! I don't know which one was the funniest. Well, BJ wins hands down. We pondered the wine bible for a bit, but BJ is a beer dude (they have a somewhat limited selection) and I am more of a cocktail girl. Loved the cosmopolitans there. Very delicious. We bypassed the appetizers, we both got Morton's salads, which were huge. I had a single cut filet and a crab cake, BJ also got a filet and bacon wrapped scallops. Both our steaks were very flavorful and cooked to perfection. For our sides, we shared asparagus and a loaded baked potato. We could not pass on dessert. I had to have Morton's Legendary Hot Chocolate Cake and BJ had the Key Lime Pie. The chocolate cake was amazing, I love it. So did BJ.  He ate it instead of his pie.  We got the pie to go and it was also very, very good. Great place for a special occasion. We had a wonderful evening.Morton's, was without a doubt one of the original esteemed statehouse restaurants in America, often emulated by others.  Great they were, with superb steaks, outstanding service and old club style ambiance. This was always a top place for business and special occasion dining. Now it is not as much as it was for my money and taste based on a recent visit.They are taken over by a very large mega restaurant chain corporation. Landry's, who are owners of over 35 restaurants and chains many you would be familiar with now own Morton's too. Morton's no longer has a focus on their original identity, meaning and purpose but are being changed in a modernized way. On my last visit changes were visible. Some changes and cost cutting and commercializing has begun. The menu is changed to include items which will appeal to a broader clientele. Now profits and growth are a bigger part of the strategy. Gone is the famous GM Bill. Bill was as much an institution as the restaurant he ran. Changed too seem to be the quality of the steaks. Our ribeyes were not a recognizable ribeye cut and the taste was not there as we remembered. One of three steaks came out drastically overcooked although the error was quickly remedied with a properly cooked replacement.I just hate to see the continuing commercialization of our esteemed restaurants in America.We decided to change-up our Ruth's Chris experience with another high rated steakhouse. Just like any night out to dinner we dressed up with a nice top and jeans, which happened to be the wrong style for the hostess at Morton's. After checking in with the girl at the front an unnamed judgmental man who sat us at our table made a judgmental comment "Oh jeans I see..." making both my girlfriend and I uneasy and uncomfortable about the rest of our experience. The drinks were average and the steaks were good, but not fabulous. In fairness, our waiter was very friendly, though.Unfortunately, our friendly waiter was not enough to overcome our bad initial impression.  I expected better, especially at a nice restaurant like this.When people are attempting to come into your establishment and spend over $150 on dinner, you should do whatever you can to make them feel as comfortable as possible.  Now I am sure never to return back to Morton's and I tell everyone I know about my negative experience.
Chuy's Mesquite Broiler=***Chain Alert***This place is a chain, but it is a decent meal.  Yes, it is slightly over priced and the food isn't the greatest.  The atmosphere is a cross between Rubios and Joe's Crab Shack and the service is compareable as well.I ordered the Fried Whitefish Tacos (see pics) and I got a little chips and salsa from the salsa bar. Here's how the meal panned out:The tacos were Great!  The baja sauce was not the typical white sauce.  It looked more like "Fry Sauce" (if you're from Utah) but it tasted great.  I mixed it with a tablespoon of their Red Hot Sauce.  The beans were unmashed pintos which i prefer over everything except whole black beans. They were decent nothing great I mixed in a bit of pico de gallo to flavor them up a bit. The rice was horrid.  I hate to say it, but you know those grains of rice that aren't cooked?  The hard ones that break your teeth from the outside in? Yeah. Those were randomly encountered during consumption.  Not a pleasant experience. The portions were small but I didn't complain because the tacos were actually pretty good! They were crispy and you could tell they were battered and fried to order. Surprising!The salsa bar was mediocre.  The Red Hot sauce was more vinigarry (word?) than deliciously hot, and the Pico De Gallo was made from canned tomatoes.  The chips were so old that by the time I got to them they were broken shards of their former selves. Pity, I was looking for a good chip pig out.The service was very good.  The first waitress told me to seat myself and to come up and order at my convenience.  When I did, another waitress took my order promptly.  The wait wasn't long, it was about 5 minutes from ordering to receiving my food.  The tables were quickly cleaned and everyone seemed happy (the customers and the employees)  It was a very comfortable and pleasant setting.Overall, this restaurant has the 'Meh' effect.  I didn't hate it, but I don't think I'd be back.Constructive Criticism:1. Add some order to the ordering process.  I was a little confused on where (and when) to order2. Get rid of the stuffed animal order numbers.  Something about greasy food and fluffy animals says more of "bacteria" than it does "uniqueness"
Carolina's Mexican Food=How have I not reviewed sweet, sweet Carolina's?This place is a dump in the best possible way.  If you've never been here, you're likely to grimace upon arrival.  Sure, the neighborhood is rough, but the real shocker is how dirty this place looks, inside and out.Why 5 stars, then?  At Carolina's, it's all about the food.  The tortillas are, as already stated, to die for.  They're soft, yet strong.  Your burrito probably won't be exploding all over itself mid-meal.I'm a huge fan of the Oaxaca Burrito, which contains generous helpings of chorizo, potato, and other delicious goodies.  The machaca is also very good.Back to the dump factor (that sounded gross, sorry).  Normally I am easily creeped out by restaurant filth, but not here.  Carolina's reminds me of Christmas Eve parties at my Nana's.  Everyone sitting at shoddy tables in a little room, eating delicious food.  The only thing missing is the mariachi.Why all the hype? I am still pondering why people rave about this place after having lunch there last week.. The location is not in the best part of town, the dining area is pretty dirty (see attached pictures) and the service sucked.We ordered a beef chimichanga, which they left in the fryer too long so it came out almost burnt and it was tiny (like 4 bites and you're done tiny).A bean and cheese burrito (good, but nothing spectacular) and a chorizo tostada, I will say the chorizo was excellent and I am glad because I had to fight for it. The place was packed when we arrived so it took us about 40 minutes to order and get our food. They call out numbers for you to pick up your order so there is this constant drone of number calling and the speaker was really loud, it was pretty annoying. To pick up your food you give them your receipt with your number on it. They gave me a bean tostada instead of a chorizo and when I took it back the guy asked me for my number to prove I ordered it.. This was the same guy I gave the ticket to when I picked it up originally. I told him this and he sighed heavily and started picking though all the receipts in the stack... A few minutes later he locates it, rolls his eyes and hands me a new tostada..The food was average and the service sub par. I won't be returning... And there are Panderias on every corner so being able to buy home made tortillas really didn't impress me that much..It's OK.  I hate to always be bitching about Mexican food in the Valley, but what can you do?  It's a disgrace.  The fact that this place appears to be some kind of Holy Grail of Mexican food here in Phoenix just seems to emphasize that point.Let's deal with the food first.  This isn't really Mexican food. It's Tex-Mex food.  That means you've got your choice of tacos, burritos, tostadas, enchiladas, chimichangas, etc.  We tried the "Oaxaca" burro (massive air quotes around the "Oaxaca" part of the name), which was just fine, but very, very small.  I mean seriously, i'ts beans, cheese, potatoes and a bit of chorizo - we're not talking ahi tuna here.  Why not give a normal sized portion?We tried the menudo which was delicious but again, a miniscule portion. And they can't even be bothered to give you a plastic bowl, so you have to eat it out of the styrofoam to go container.  I mean, for F's sake, they give me a plastic bowl at my favorite taco truck.  Still hungry, we ordered a combination plate, which was the same sort of tex-mex crap that you can get pretty much anywhere in town.  Not so great.It was all fine for what it is (I guess) but nothing that I would particularly go out of my way for, with the exception of the homemade flour tortillas, which were awesome.  I even bought some to go.  And that's about it for the food.Now as to the restaurant itself, it's actually pretty disgusting, to the point where one has to conclude that they are just showing contempt for the customers.  The place is filthy.  The bathrooms, in particular, are vile. As Tony Bourdain says, "I may not be able to look in the kitchen but I can check out the bathroom and that let's me know how much they care about the restaurant." Uh, exactly!   And the answer in Carolina's would seem to be, "not very much."  The surly and uninterested staff add to that special ambiance. We eat in lots of small ethnic restaurants and just because a place is "in the hood" doesn't mean it has to be gross.  Our favorite Salvadorean restaurant is in the hood but it's also hospital clean, which makes me pretty confident that the kitchen is also clean. Finally, the neighborhood.  LOL.  To describe this street as "in the hood" is an insult to "hoods" everywhere.  This street is one of the most blighted streets I've ever been on, anywhere.  I'm actually thinking of going back there today to do some documentary photos to send to my friends in Cambodia whose visions of America are mostly derived from CSI Miami.  Seriously, it's appalling.  The main thing I was thinking about driving away from there is that the Phoenix city government needs some kind of federal intervention.So would I eat there again?  Yeah, probably, if I was in the neighborhood.  Would I go out of my way to drive there?  No way.My time in Phoenix wasn't going to be complete without some Mexican food.  It didn't have to be "authentic," just a local's eatery.  I was already tired of the airport Mexican food, so instead of venturing straight there on my way out, I took a 20 minute detour to visit the city's top rated Mexican joint, none other than the infamous Carolina's.Ever have that uneasy feeling of "I don't know about this..." while exploring a new neighborhood?  This was exactly one of those times.  I already knew it was a dive, but I didn't know it was going to be a scene from the movies, almost as if Compton was ever smack dab in the middle of desert.  Even when we questioned our GPS directions, it never lead us astray.  Within a few minutes into a ghost town of project like homes, we found Carolina's.  There wasn't any windows, some minor graffiti, looking something like a warehouse with a bare parking lot.  The doors were painted black on an all white building, I was just waiting to open the doors to find bikers and extras from the movie From Dusk Till Dawn.Instead, I found a mix of patrons from all social classes, some waiting in line, and many sitting quietly enjoying their meal.  After a quick peak at the menu, I noticed nothing was in Spanish.  The guys behind the counter were all speaking flawless English and then I realized none of the clientele was Hispanic.  Could access to decent Mexican food be any easier?  I decided to ask the guys behind the counter for things that weren't on the menu and they jokingly retorted, "Go to Mexico, this is Carolinas."  The entire menu reminded me of the fast food Mexican joints (a la Muchas Gracias in Oregon) I've seen throughout the west coast, thought he prices weren't as dirt cheap as I had hoped but still a good deal nonetheless.Without abandon, I ordered a mix of enchiladas, tacos, tamales, and their infamous tortillas that were made in house.  In short, I did not come away disappointed.  The tamales were fresh, steaming away as I unwrapped the corn husks.  A quick cut into the masa revealed the fine starch hugging the bits of shredded chicken just perfectly and spiced with the perfect amount of salsa verde.  They were good enough for me to consider ordering a second one, but I was on a limited time frame.  The hard shelled taco was totally what I was used to back home - deep fried, packed, and super greasy - producing an unmistakable crunch without falling apart.  The enchiladas were drenched in a salsa roja sauce, meshed with a bed of frijoles and cheese.  This was greasy Mexican at it's finest, the kind where artery salvation was never part of the agenda, sinful with every bite.  A surprising thumbs up goes to their tortillas, simple yet hearty.  The tortillas con queso were undoubtedly cheesy and though nothing like the ones I've eaten in Mexico, were worth their weight in saturated fat.If I somehow warrant more visits to Phoenix, I can see myself coming out here for my greasy Mexican fix.  I still need to try their burritos, flautas, chimis, and tostadas.  If I like what I see and more importantly what I taste, I might be able to award this lil dive another whole star.This location is in the hood but I don't care. I will go anywhere for Carolina's tacos! I don't know what they do to the tacos here but they are like crack. I could eat them everyday! With rice and beans and a side of sour cream. I can't get myself to order anything else. This Mexican food joint lives up to the hype.This is in a tough part of town, but well worth it. It is near the airport so that makes it easy as well. The food is very good here and they do a booming bussiness.So everything is very fresh all day long. You can eat here or get it to go. The dining room could use a major overhaul but, I guess it adds to the look.Very little parking but, you will find some becaue, again it is worth it. You can even get Tamales to go by the Dozen. Take them home and freeze them. Yes this Italian loves Mexican food as well. The prices are super resonable. Service is hit or miss, though they do work very hard here. Since they are always so busy. All good here.Oh burrito, where art though?I haven't had a good burrito in quite a while and decided that I wanted to visit Carolina's in South Phoenix (12th st and Mohave - just south of Lincoln) . I hadn't been to Carolina's (Cave Creek and Cactus) since we moved from North Phoenix a while ago. As my first visit to their downtown location, I was quickly reminded why this is one of my favorite Mexican food spots in Phoenix. I waited in a line filled with of "out of place" business casual, police officers, and Mexican nationals alike. This isn't exactly what I would call the normal business lunch locale; you don't come here for the ambiance. The food is served on styrofoam and paper plates, and the table service doesn't exist. I definitely don't suggest taking your special lady here on a date night.With ala-cart tacos and burritos ranging from a couple $ through six or seven, this place is easy on the wallet. This is exactly what I was looking for and I savored every last bite of my Machaca (aka: beef) burrito, and taco! That was one great meal. Now I can scurry back to my mid-town office and finish up the day in style. Carolina's claims the valley's best tortillas; which can be ordered by the dozen and taken home, and you won't hear any disagreements from me. The fresh made tortillas are super thin, tasty, and never seem to break when you eat them, like many others will do.Happy Yelping Phoenix, Carolina's serves up some mean Mexican delights!So far the best Mexican food I've had in Arizona, HANDS DOWN.I've lived in Arizona for 39 years.Go, go NOW.  Stop reading this and go, NOW.If you start your order by asking for your machaca cooked to medium, egg whites only-scrambled softly, on a gluten free tortilla, half red and half green sauce but only on the side, you're not only in the wrong restaurant you're in the wrong neighborhood! This isn't the Biltmore B!+@#3$; this is Carolina's, take or leave it! I've been eating the burritos from here for years, thanks to my work. When you need to feed a hungry crew of construction guys, this is the place to order from! I finally made it over to Carolina's for the first time about a week ago. The parking lot was packed, big dog included, (waiting for his share no doubt) the line long filled with suit wearing business men, utility workers, even the Maricopa County posse knows where to go for good food. You won't wait long, the 20 plus employees make this joint roll like clockwork. Watching them roll out  dozens of tortillas, (probably thousands per day)is amazing. These tortillas are enormous and melt in your mouth like butter. They sell them at only $5.25/dozen $3.25/half, definitely worth every dime!You can't beat the burritos, great flavor and cheap at around $4. My favorite is the Machaca w/egg and the chorizo; add a little jalapenos for kick, top it with their delicious salsa and you've got a fiesta in your mouth!Step out of your neighborhood and come to Carolina's!
Sergio El Pollo Feliz=Well, I think I found my Mexican grilled chicken spot in AZ................I had this place bookmarked and decided to come down today. This style of chicken is my favorite and I am always on the lookout for places that cook it this way over charcoal.  I looked at some of the Yelp pictures and noticed that they had/have a promotion for Wednesdays (Buy one whole chicken, get half a chicken gratis).  I drove on down to check it out.  I walked inside, placed my order for the Wednesday special and a few minutes later, I was handed a heavy bag and was on my way.  Here is how it was.......Chicken-  Wow!  Fantastic chicken!  Reminded me of some of my SD joints.  I opened the container and there was a massive mound of chicken!  3 breasts, 3 wings (one was like a half wing), 3 thighs and 3 legs.  This pile of chicken smelled fantastic.  I bit into a wing first and was instantly comforted by the charcoal, smoky taste of the grilled chicken.  It was fantastic!  This was after a 30 minute ride in the car, too.  Still hot, still moist, and still delicious!  The legs were really large, the breasts were nice and big and even the thighs were tasty (I usually don't like or eat the thighs)!  I scarfed down almost a whole chicken and saved a few of the breasts for lunch tomorrow!Sides-  I'm doing low carb so I didn't really dive into these.  I did sample half a tortilla, a bite of rice and some of the salsa.  All 3 were delicious.  I tossed the beans (pinto beans, kind of watery) and saved the rice for my son and the salsa for later on tonight.  They also pack in 2 grilled jalapenos which were hot and spicy and a "side salad" which was a few pieces of lettuce and a tomato...random lol!The lady running the joint was very friendly and smiling the whole time.  This whole thing only cost $14.90!  Yup....on Wednesdays, less than $15 bucks gets you 12 pieces of chicken, rice, beans, tortillas and salsa.  One hell of a deal!  I am sad that starting next week, I will not have Wednesdays off any more.  If you ARE off on Wednesdays, and enjoy this type of chicken, it is well worth the drive down here!  I will be back soon enough!
Farm At South Mountain=Trying to figure out what to have for breakfast - not really wanting the the usual hotel fare of sausage, scrambled eggs and french toast that's been sitting on a warming table. Talking with S on the phone this morning and he's on Yelp looking for unique places for me to check out that's in close proximity to my hotel. He mentions the Farm at South Mountain - it sounds intriguing, so why not? It sounds so much better than what was being offered at the hotel.The Farm at South Mountain is one of Phoenix's gems...When I first arrived, I wasn't quite sure what to make of the place.  I took a walk down the little road towards the back end of the property. Here you will find an open grassy area with shade trees and rows of picnic tables and space enough for kids to run and stretch out their legs. There's also an expansive organic garden with rows of vegetables and flowers which I understand supplies the cafes that are on site with all their fresh produce. A little further behind the garden, the Morning Glory Cafe serves breakfast, The Retreat - a place for massages, facials, Reiki and mid-wife counseling, and the Cottage - a place for local artists to display and showcase their artwork.After I had breakfast at the Morning Glory Cate (that's another review) I spent some time at the artists studio looking over the work of some very talented artists.The lunch spot is the Farm Kitchen which is located towards the entrance of the complex. By the time I walked toward the entrance, the Farm Kitchen was bustling with the lunch crowd. I didn't get lunch, but from what I could tell, everything looked fresh and yummy. I stopped in to pick up some fruit, some bakery goods and a drink while waiting for the hotel shuttle to come pick me up. The Farm at South Mountain is a great place to find respite from the hustle and bustle of the city - even for a short while.Being 72, I felt my parents tremble a bit when I said I was taking them to the "farm". Growing up in the midwest, it wasnt rare to hear "somebody bought the farm". This did not mean an uncle decided to purchase a ranch, but rather, met his maker, is now six feet under or my favorite, "he's in a better place now." That said, my folks were delighted at our Farm experience. It's always a challenge getting dad a plain sandwich in any restaurant but they were very accommodating. Mom and I both enjoyed our turkey sandwiches and the ice tea is extra good. Maybe it's brewed in the sun. That would be very farm-like, no? Now, I get the whole theme here with the picnic tables and all. Just not a big fan of it myself. That, and walking on grass. Ewww! But it's called the Farm and not the City, so no points docked for that. Really a unique Phoenix experience with a gift shop, walking trails and the smell of dirt. So hitch up your tractor and git on down to the Farm.great sandwiches and olive oil products!I can't stop coming here. From the day that I discovered this place, I'm here pretty much any chance I get for lunch.It's incredible to drive less than 10 minutes from my client's offices and find myself at a beautiful farm. I love eating at the wooden picnic tables under the trees that adorn the long grass field adjacent to the Farm's kitchen. You feel like you've left the world you were in, and gone off to simpler time and place, the kind you see in movies or read about in books. It's an incredible 30 minute vacation from work. Just be careful as the summer months approach, eating outside can take it's toll in 100 degree weather.But the Farm doesn't get a 5-star rating on ambiance alone - the food here is fantastic. Everything is about as fresh as it can be - the vegetables are crisp and vibrant, the breads are all fresh baked and incredibly delicious, and the meats are always tender and juicy.I love getting two half sandwiches (at no extra cost), and frequently will choose an old favorite and an interesting new item.My absolute favorites:Tuscan Sandwich . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $10.95Grilled herb chicken, marinated artichokes, shredded Parmesan Reggiano and Asiago, balsamic dressing, tomatoes, herb mayo and organic field greens on focacciaGrilled Chicken BLTDA Sandwich . . . . . . . . . $10.95Marinated chicken breast, crisp Meat Shop bacon, organic field greens, local Black Sphinx dates, Granny Smith apples and tomatoes with basil mayo on potato breadAnd if you're eating vegetarian (make sure to add avocado):Farm Fresh Seasonal Sandwich . . . . . . . . . . . . $10.95Local seasonal roasted vegetables, shredded Parmesan Reggiano and Asiago, hummus and organic field greens on nine-grainEvery dessert I've had here is marvelous. The chocolate cake stands out as magical (incredibly rich, yet somehow feels light enough to float on air).Go. Now.If you've been looking for the best kept secret in Phoenix, this isn't really you're place, cause it's not that much of a secret anymore. If you're looking for an urban escape into the farming community of Phoenix past, then be sure to stop in for a visit.  I've always heard good things about Morning Glory café here at the farm at south mountain for brunch on the weekends, we had a visitor in town, wanted food, was looking for an experience we've never had, one plus one equals two, so we ended up at the farm!I'm so glad we chose to dine at morning glory, the entire place is super cool. Lined in an old pecan grove, there are a handful of shops to check out, some artist studios, two or three places to eat, and the grounds are a great place to take in also. This was the perfect stop for brunch before we headed up to the top of south mountain to check out the views. For anyone in the market, this is also a wedding venue, it's a venue like none other in Phoenix - if you're looking for that. :-)Happy Yelping Phoenix, be sure to put this on your bucket list for Phoenix if you haven't been yet!I'm mortified!  I've never written a review of the Farm at South Mountain?  I'm not sure how this is even possible!I go here so often that this might actually be my favorite place in Phoenix to go for a relaxing cool/warm Saturday or Sunday afternoon in PHoenix.  In fact, I think I'm headed there momentarily.Many people write reviews for the various "businesses" at the Farm on South Mountain on the wrong Business/Venue pages.  But I guess this listing is a catch-all for everything.  Let's see if I can help people get this clear.  I really want to point that the Farm at South Mountain has several "businesses" and venues listed on Yelp.  You can go here for breakfast, lunch or dinner.  You can have your baby shower here or your 200+ person wedding and reception here.  You can hold a corporate event in "Stoned Grove" area around an outdoor pizza oven or you can have an intimate dinner under mature trees with glimmers of stars at night at Quiessence.  This place is a one stop shop for everything simple and beautiful in the out of doors.  I've written reviews for a few of the places on the farm and I will let those reviews speak for themselves.  I've posted pics too... One of the things that the Yelping community might appreciate knowing is that you should visit their website for special events.  Sometimes, they have special Farm dinners.  Sometimes there's a special holiday dinner or lunch.  For instance, I know for Valentine weekend, they have Valentine Dinners and Picnic lunches.  Here are my reviews of places on the farm:Maya's Farm (At the end of the Farm Drive and directly North.)Organic Certified Farm.  See them at the Farm on Sunday mornings.  Phoenix Public Market on Saturdays and also get on their CSA)-http://www.yelp.com/biz/mayas-farm-phoenix#hrid:5dPGtdn4SQIClbJ_uIe1zwSucculentia (it is in the green house on the north side of the farm, back by Maya's garden House)http://www.yelp.com/biz/succulentia-phoenix#hrid:Z91CIQ4jVqF9RG3HrRe22wThe Farm Kitchen (Lunch/Brunch and is the closest to the Picnic Tables.  you see it immediately as you enter the farm, north of  "The Farm Driveway".)http://www.yelp.com/biz/the-farm-kitchen-phoenix#hrid:7w3mgerwC9Yqd_b1amkDjA/src:selfMorning Glory (Breakfast only, but the patio is a nice place to rent for an event.  Go All the way to the end of the Farm Drive and YOu'll find it.)http://www.yelp.com/biz/morning-glory-cafe-phoenix#hrid:yzI8RxBsNlKndP1HMQ0Q6AThere are a few other businesses on the Farm listed on YelpWeddings:(I am sure there was a wedding listing on Yelp for the FASM because I used to check in to it accidentally when I first started Yelping.  If I find it, I will update)Quiessence (I haven't written a reveiw of this either.  SMH!!):http://www.yelp.com/biz/quiessence-restaurant-phoenixBotanica (Been here once, but no review)http://www.yelp.com/biz/botanica-phoenix-3This is a great place to visit after you've completed a Hike on South Mountain too.  Enjoy.  Thank me later.I recently took a friend who was visiting from Chicago here and he looked around and said, "I thought you guys only had desert and cactus".  Well, that's the usual stereotype but no, we have a lot of farms; you should have seen the look on his face when I pointed out some of the cotton fields in the south and east valley!.As others have said, this is just a gem of a place. I just can't think of a more peaceful place to enjoy a meal.  My go-to spot is the Morning Glory Cafe. Good coffee, fresh-pressed juice from local citrus and the huevos rancheros are delicious.  After eating I like to walk through the pecan trees and check out the garden plots.Nice, relaxing spot. Great way to start the day.
Hard Rock Café=-- Great little Hard Rock Cafe in Downtown!!****Service and food were pretty good.  They even had a small fashion show going on the night of the 26th. :) Very entertaining!!
Chipotle Mexican Grill=The best Chipotle is located on Detroit Road in Lakewood, OH. Sorry, I know it's a drive, but it's the truth. However, right now this is the closest Chipotle to my place so I'll review it. But this review is for Chipotle as a chain, not this particular location. If I were to review a specific location, I would review the one in Lakewood, OH because it is the best one.Chipotle is really really good. I love the burrito assembly line. I love that they aren't stingy with...anything. At least with me they aren't. I think they may pick up on the subtle "BITCH I WILL CUT YOU" look in my eye if they even hint at putting the spoon down after only one scoop of chicken.  Either way, it's awesome.It's in that weird "fast food atmosphere without fast food pricing" quadrant of the restaurant world, which I normally don't like but with Chipotle it's acceptable because you are getting a burrito the size of a baby for about $7.  Woulda given it 5 stars, but the one in Lakewood, OH is better.
Olive Or Twist=I stopped by Olive or Twist for a couple of drinks with my friend and fellow Yelper Carrie W. after seeing The Nutcracker at the Benedum last Fri.  When Carrie suggested that we grab some drinks, I suggested that we go to Olive or Twist because I'd been wanting to check it out for awhile. I rarely receive the opportunity to go out for drinks after shows because some of my friends who I attend shows with tire out early (lame) or don't really go to bars ever (even lamer), so I was excited to finally have the opportunity to imbibe a few in a classy setting downtown.Given that it was my birthday, I knew exactly what I wanted drink-wise, thanks to Rachel C.'s review: the cake batter martini!  Thanks to other reviews, I was aware that O or T's specialty martinis are dessert-y drinks rather than your typical martini.  This was absolutely fine by me, since I enjoy sweeter digestifs later at night.  As can be seen from my photo, this martini comes with a rim of chocolate syrup spangled with multicolored decorative sprinkles, which made for a very festive--and delicious--birthday drink.  Once I finished it, I went for a second round and chose the mint chocolate martini, which also came adorned with chocolate syrup.  It tasted exactly like melted mint ice cream--my favorite kind.  Yum!We sat at the upstairs side bar, and service from the bartenders was generally good--one of them even wished me happy birthday when I mentioned why I was ordering the cake batter martini.  While it was busy, it wasn't so crowded as to feel claustrophobic.  The noise level was a bit on the loud side--but then again, what bar isn't?I really enjoyed my visit to O or T, and look forward to returning again, once I can convince my friends to stop by for a drink.  I'd love to check out the happy hour, in particular.  Because I haven't tried the regular (non-specialty) drinks or the food, I'm going with a 4, but I'll update my review once I return and do so.This was our second visit to Olive or Twist.  We came over this past summer for food and cocktails, but this last visit was just for the booze to have a celebratory drink with Laura M on her Birthday after seeing a great Ballet at the Benedum.  I don't mind O&T layout.  It's a bit chopped up but very Pittsburghese reminiscent of most establishments.  There is the upstairs where you can sit by the roaring fire on the 72" flat screen or lounge on many of the couches or loveseats they have available.  There is also the downstairs that seems to have similar offerings, however at least in our experiences was a lot busier than upstairs.  I pick less busy almost every time. This time around we found three bar seats available upstairs and settled down for a couple drinks.  I started with a Southern Tier XXX IPA, solid start to the evening.  I know they specialize in Martinis but I specialize in craft beer.  After that I decided to try a martini, I went with an Espresso Manhattan Martini.  This was defreakinlishious... I love coffee and I love manhattans so the two went together like peas and carrots.  Our service was mixed.  Some bartenders seemed more helpful and interested in waiting on us than others.  This was also my experience from last time.  This time we didn't order food though we were pretty hungry and went elsewhere to eat.  Our last meal here was not worth duplicating.  We both had an Olive or Twist Burger, and I chose sweet potato fries and requested a med rare cook.  We used the Yelp deal so it wasn't as expensive as it could have been, but the burger sells for $13.00.  I rarely complain about cost especially if it is good, however it really was not.  The meat was way overcooked and dry.  Surprisingly the fries were the best thing on the plate.  To spend that on a burger I do expect a better quality.  So lesson learned, we had some tasty drinks here last weekend, but ate at a neighboring facility afterwards.  I'm sure we will be back for drinks again.
Oregano's Pizza Bistro=Oregano's Shmeragono's... the juggernaut Italian restaurant chain in Phoenix has people waiting in line seven days a week. Must be amazing?! Must be soooo tastey?! Must have fantastic service and ambience?! No. No. And no. Most of the staff is definitely professional, speedy and fun. My take out gal the other day "scolded" me for arriving too early. "I said 25 minutes...whyd you get here too early?""To spend time with you, you prickly ass pear"Anyway I hung out and waited my full alloted time. No biggie. I ordered 3 apps and 1 medium pizza. "That'll be $47 dollars please." says miss prickly ass pear.I  arrive home to my $22 medium BBQ pizza. Thin crust. Nice sauce. Tastey all around. The stuffed mushrooms. Not so great. More salt then Salt Lake City. And at least a pound of crumbled Italian sausage. Portabellos were too slimy. Like bad canned fruit. Garlic cheese bread...well, come on how can you screw that up. My dog can make garlice bread (and it's not bad by the way). All in all. I'd rather get take out than sit inside at this location. Not a big fan of the cluttered look. There are pictures and knick knack crap everywhere. It looks like an Italian flea market threw up everywhere!Oregano's is home to the Great Dessert War of '02. The skirmish began when the then named Bazookie was placed on the dinner table. The Bazookie as describe by the menu is "a 1/2 pound of Chocolate Chip dough, slightly baked in a 6-inch pizza pan then topped with 3 scoops of vanilla bean ice cream." Things started out with the appropriate amount of consideration for the other diner til the first bite was consumed. A fire was noticed in each others eye. Utensils soon became weapons. Ground was won and lost. The battleground was a deep dish pizza pie pan that was spun numerous times in order to gain advantage for the best and perfect bite. Spoon fulls of warm cookie dough were knocked down back onto the table to be taken away... It turned ugly quick. No offers of sharing or giving the last bite. It was fought for tooth and nail. The dessert was THAT GOOD. I would go back to Phoenix for this dish alone. And the pizza? It is a pizza joint, but that's not what we talk about or remember. The pizza was good, but not on the level of the dessert. Freshly baked chocolate chip cookie dough and vanilla ice cream!!!! What more do you people need???A man came over to my house last night with a bag of food.  Luckily, I knew he was coming.  OK, it was a "dinner and a movie" date and he brought a huge bag from Oregano's.  As I started to get out plates and silverware, he mentioned that paper plates, plastic utensils and napkins were in the bag.  Well, he sprung for dinner, I can clean a few plates, right?  HUGE portions!  He brought spaghetti with marinara.  It was angel hair.  I think there *could* have been more sauce.  The lasagna was their "Italian Flag" lasagna and really good!  Ooey-gooey with sausage and meatballs stuffed inside.  The portion was enormous as well.  We both had a hunk and I had another one today for lunch.  Both entrees had different kinds of garlic bread included in the container.  The appetizer was something I'd never had before: Toasted Ravioli.  WTF???  Handmade ravioli, stuffed and fried with a side of marinara sauce to dip them in.  There was definitely some kick to it, as they were stuffed with cheese and jalapenos.It was a very satisfying meal and I'm giving it three stars.  The portions were big, the prices were reasonable (looking at the website since he brought it to my place) and everything was full of flavor.    This was no Harley's meal, but for something quick and Italian, it wasn't half bad!  Of course, eating a meal on the couch with a cute guy will always be a plus!As a pizza savant, I am severely limited by both nature and nurture:)I have been to the pinnacle (Bianco's Pizzeria)...a couple of times, in fact...and found it unfulfilling:(I have looked into the pizza abyss (Chuck E Cheese or Totino's Frozen...too close to call), and come away scarred but stronger.I suppose some of it is nurture...the cattle ranch was a hard place to grow up and I did not eat pizza until I left home at 15 for college...Shakey's in Corvallis, OR:)Losing my pizza virginity was a revelation and a delight:)...I was forever altered...forever better:)And there is, no doubt, some nature involved...I can only think of 2 things that I can't eat and neither one involves pizza of any sort:)And that brings me to today...I will at least try anybody's pizza pie:)Some are better than others, but very few are truly bad:)So when the Beautiful Carin and I wandered over to Oregano's the other night, it was with the anticipation of a pretty good pizza and a pleasant atmosphere to enjoy it in:)We were not disappointed:)The entirely reasonable 20 minute wait went by quickly with free pizza slices to nibble and frequent refills for our drinks, while we sat comfortably and listened to the music:)When we got our table...outside, under the mist...our server was friendly, attentive and knowledgeable...but we already knew what we wanted:)It's all pretty good at Oregano's:)This time we had a deep dish pepperoni, sausage, mushroom and olive pie, along with a Mrs. Gibbilini's spinach salad...way too much for 2 people but the leftovers are great for lunches and dinner for 2 more days:)We've had the thin crust, the Chicago style, sandwiches, and salad...even the wings, on occasion:)The pies are well designed, well prepared, customizable and tasty!The sauce isn't too sweet, the cheeses selected for the pies complement the sauce and the crusts are well made and have great "tooth"...the right mix of crunchy vs. chewy:)I've seen the debates...oh yes, I read the reviews..."Chicago pies rock"..."New York is the only real pizza"...yada, yada, yada:)Well, I am waiting for a pizza to rock my world the way that first slice of Shakey's pepperoni did, all those years ago...it may not ever happen...they say you never forget your first time:)But Oregano's always serves up a good pie (regardless of whether I'm in the mood for Chicago, Thin crust, deep dish or whatever...along with all the accompaniments and alternatives I could ask for:)Does Oregano's rock my world?...No, only the Beautiful Carin does that these days, but they do bake up a pretty decent pie:)Wow, so the food here is pretty good, but the wait is silly.  I mean it, silly.  We ordered a pizza and the waiter immediately asked us if we knew it was at least 45 minutes for a thin crust and an hour for a deep dish?  Huh?  What in the name of God takes that long to assemble a pizza?  I can *almost* understand the long wait on a deep dish simply because of the cooking time, almost.  But 45 minutes for a thin crust (we're talking a crust so thin it's almost like a huge circular Saltine cracker) is friggen ridiculous.  Sorry, Oregano's, but that is just too long.So rant about the ridiculous wait time aside, the food here is actually pretty good, and they can make a side of calamari like nobody's business.  It's delicious.  My toddler and I mowed through a serving of calamari and had enough to take home to snack on the next night.  I also had a mojito and it was very good, crisp, refreshing and yummy.  And as far as the pizza goes it was very good, and my husband throughly enjoyed it.  It was just the right amount of cheese and the crust was perfect.  Good pizza, awful wait.   Like my last sit-down dining experience this waiter also somehow managed to completely ignore the presense of my toddler and I finally had to ask him to get us a cup of water for her.  Rant Alert!  I seriously do NOT understand why wait staff ignore the babies and small children of paying patrons.  Yes, it's true that my two year old won't be tipping you, or placing a food order, or even mentioning her experience on Yelp, but her mommy sure as hell will, so at least acknowledge that when you take drink orders every living, breathing human being at the table probably needs their own beverage and may need to order their own food too. Knowing the wait on the pizza I got clever and called over our waiter and asked him to put in an order for a pizzokie (sp?) for us, to go.  I explained that I couldn't make my toddler behave much longer and he graciously told me that he didn't mind noisy babies, which was great, except I bet all the patrons around us WOULD mind it if my daughter decided she was done being nice and was ready to start banging the salt shaker on the table while bellowing out 'Twinkle Twinkle Little Star' at the stop of her tiny lungs.  ;)  So after some puzzlement at my (apparently odd) request to take dessert to go he finally got it sorted out and we were able to pay and leave with our delicious dessert before the impending meltdown.So all in all this was a nice visit, but that wait time on the pizza needs to be shortened.  Seriously!TALE OF TWO TRIPSDuring our lengthy stay in PDX one of The Nines Portland (Starwood Hotel) concierge encouraged us as a must try to visit this particular Oregano's Pizza Bistro. He said the pepperoni thin pizza, rigatoni and salad were his very favorite.On our first Sunday evening in Phoenix, we make it priority to have dinner here. He did warn us that it's a very busy place.  So we arrived after 8pm and coincidentally parked right in front of the "welcome" sign. Again the parking gods were looking after us. If's most unusual for us to be offered water while waiting outdoors for our table. As it turns out we eventually get seated outdoor at a bar table for two. This is where we meet our server Lucas along with his manager Jonny (yes, it's not a misspelling).Told them that our PDX hotel concierge had been touting about their entrees. We proceeded to order the following mindful that we're intentionally over ordering and that the servings are huge in portions:- Jr Pablo Picasso Salad- Big Rig Pasta adding two meatballs to this rigatoni dish- Numero One-0 12" thin crust pizzaI think we had to be careful not to attempt to finish everything that was in front of us. It was all very very good. As a welcome to Phoenix gesture, Jonny treated us to their Pizza Cookie Chocolate Chip with chocolate mint Ice cream. By the time we were ready to hit the bed, it was very close to closing time.Note:  The pizza didn't make it past bedtime.  In the meanwhile it was salad and Big Rig for lunch the next day.  My classmates keep looking me as if I was a meal on wheels.OTHER TRIPDidn't know that our class would run so late that it eliminated many of our restaurants we had listed that closed at 8pm and 9pm.  Intentionally we keep a number of them along the 16th Street corridor.So Yu-go chauffeur says let's go back to Oregano's and say hi to Jonny and Lucas.  This time we're seated indoors where its quite cool with all the red and green.  Asked Jonny to recommend something other than what we had tried previously.  This time we're more conscious of portions.- Junior sized Beefstro Salad that's spicy- Clark Street Meat 12" thin crust pizza- Pizza Cookie Chocolate Chip with two different flavors of ice cream (told Jonny that we would buy our dessert this time. He still comped us)When it was all said and done, there was nothing to take back to the hotel.MANGA TALEThe pizza crust is flat bread thin and crispy so that we didn't feel like we were filling up with pizza dough.. Perhaps I would instruct them to cook it for a few seconds longer just to ensure that the crust remained crispy throughout our eating experience. Our personal preference would be the Clark Street Meat and Big Rig Pasta.  Both salads finished tied.A very big thanks to "Aire-Bear" of PDX for this wonderful experience. BTW his favorite is the Big Rig.I've never truly understood the Oregano's allure. It's a chain with the same menu and products in every location. There is always a wait for tables and rarely a seat at the bar. This is good for them but not for me. I find their food average at best. The pizza is great, but everything else on the menu is subpar. I ordered the salad yesterday and it was the ass end of a head of romain (you know all the yellow bits no one wants to eat) with a few soggy croutons and cucumbers. I ate less that a ¼ of it. I also got the meatballs that were doused in cheese to make up for their dryness but they weren't fooling anyone. Our server was great and they do have a nice patio but with so many great authentic locations in Phoenix I doubt I will be back.Decided to take some of my hippie friends here and treat them to some Real Big Salads. They live nearby and had not been here before. Plus a little fiber never killed anyone ... right?I've always liked this particular pizza chain and this location is just like the others. They have all the similar do-dads hanging on the walls and the menu is gigantic.Ordered my favorite Rib Eye Salad in the biggest size they have. They call it The Big Beefstro Salad on the menu and it is really good. The dressing has a sweet Serrano Pepper flavor going on and it is pretty spicy. This one was so big I had to bring some home for later.My friends ordered the Pablo Picasso Mexico Salad and it was giant. They also were excited about the size and had to ask for a box for the leftovers as well.Service was very friendly and we experienced several greetings. They even opened the doors as we both entered and left the building. We were surprised by the large amount of take out orders that were waiting for people to pick them up.Looking forward to trying out some pizza again and possibly checking out their famous all Original Pizza Cookie with Ice Cream. Dang it looked scrumptious and would definitely ruin my girlish figure. MAMA MIA!4 STARSSo, I was dining at Oregano's with a couple of love birds and finally I got fed up with the pda's. Before I could stop myself I climbed on top of the table and drenched them with my ice water. "Can I enjoy my dinner please? Either cool it, or get a room. I came to review the food, not your french kissing."I came back to reality just as appetizers arrived. I would never do that or say that to friends...or would I?  Anyway, just like Donald Trump, Oregano's does everything real BIG so we honestly didn't need to order all this food, but none of us counts calories. That's so 90's.Here are my thoughts:  Four stars for the overly friendly staff and thin crust pizza. pizzaNot a fan of pan pizza or stuffed pizza. Oregano's really does 'em up, but looks aren't everything. I choose thin crust every time. Yummy.  Simple. Easy to eat. The thicker pies turn into cheesy messes and turn me off.  I get reminded of strings of spittle when the cheese pulls apart. I realize how this can be a turn on for some food whores, but not me.   bruschetta Please tell me what the big deal is. Anyone? It's bread, with stuff on top - but it's not pizza. If that's your thing, fine, but why do you think you fancy, huh? Oregano's bruschetta just looked sloppy. Big and sloppy. It literally looked like a mound of tomatoes with cheese and basil and some bread sticking out.guaca-tonyHow do you say delicious, d-lovely, D-lectable, d-vine? How do you say D-gorgeous? D-lite? Guacamole was seasoned with basil, garlic, onions, and tomatoes. It was good, but I wish folks would stop putting tomatoes in guac.  The flavor gets watered down. What helped kick up the mildness were the accompanied cheesy salty pizza pie crust dipping slices. Good combination.yam fries/sweet po'sYum yum piggy! Comes with aioli and sweet seasoning sprinkled on - which I could totally do without. Leave the natural sweetest alone. salad On a good day, crispy romaine lettuce is usually a sign of a good salad. But my first bite of Oregano's salad left me with the taste of bag/packaging in my mouth. It wasn't overpowering enough to stop eating, but a disappointment is just that. I regretted not requesting spinach in place of romaine.BEGIN SIDE NOTEBest salad at Oregano's: the delicious spinach salad with red onions, marinated portobello shrooms, roasted red bell pepper, and avocado dressing. But that's just a memory now. This salad was removed from the menu. Whose dumb idea was that?END SIDE NOTEVeggie Wedgie sandwich.  Skip it. The foccacia bread is way too thick to even enjoy the flavor of the eggplant, portobellos, spinach, and tomatoes. It's served with red pepper aioli and for some reason I had the idea in my brain this should be spicy. It was not and fell flat.scampiThe love birdies thought the scampi was delicious. I can only give their opinions because I won't eat pasta, or paste noodles as I call them. Lady is a Scampi is shrimp with corkscrew pasta in chipotle sauce, tomatoes, cilantro, cheese, and garlic. The spicier version called El Diablo Shrimp Pasta is in chipotle cream sauce with fettuccine, cheese, and pico de gallo.pizza cookieThe only dessert they serve. It's warm and topped with ice cream, but way sweet and a little raw. If that's how you go down on your cookies, go 'head playa! (Not playa as in the beach, playa as in play-er.)
Murphy's Pub=With its scarred wood tables, friendly staff, blaring sports games, and dim lighting, Murphy's is a local institution.  It's also where history graduate students tend to congregate once a week, huzzah.  The beer/food specials are generally fantastic, and the grimy feel of the bar is palatable after a drink or two.  One caveat: they have the nastiest--nastiest bathroom.  It's hideous.  Ugh.
Roma Garden Ristorante=Another great Italian find!My BF and I went to Roma Garden for dinner last night because he was given a gift certificate there from a friend.  We'd never heard of it, but we're always up for trying something new, especially with $50 towards our meal.  We pulled up to their strip mall location without expectations and we were both pleasantly surprised!When you walk in, the lighting and decor are welcoming and the staff is friendly and attentive.  It was a Thursday night and there were plenty of other guests in the restaurant, and there was a lively energy in the air.  After browsing the menu, I ordered one of the few 'Chef's Specials' of the night - tilapia with fresh veggies and pasta in a lemon caper sauce.  BF went with Pollo Parmagiana.  He had a glass of cabernet and I had pinot grigio... and voila - a warm bread basket arrived on our table at just the right time!We were both happy with our orders when they arrived as well... the fish was cooked just right and the sauce was tasty... good portions as well!  Although we were full, we decided to order a dessert to share - the homemade snow white chocolate tartufo - yum!  The perfect sweet ending to our meal.  In addition, we were each brought an after dinner drink of amaretto on the rocks, on the house.****I just have to share that I was pleasantly surprised that the women's restroom was clean, spacious, and had a fresh fragrance to it - I normally don't notice that, but I was impressed by this!In speaking to the waiter and the owner, we learned that this restaurant recently changed locations but they've been in business for over 15 years.  Gotta love the local businesses that last in the valley... we'll be back to support Roma Garden and enjoy their fine "Northern Italian Cuisine" without a doubt.  I suggest you go check it out also - bon appetito!V-Day 2013, destination: Roma Garden Ristorante! Here is the synopsis:~Fud/Drink~Fiance got the Fettuccine Alfredo with chicken and asparagus. It tasted well and had the flavors just right, the sauces were just a tad bland and oily. I got the Linguini Pescatore with mussels, shrimp and other fresh seafood mixed in a white wine sauce. I see a common theme with the flavors not being too exciting for other diners, which is a shame. Traditional cooking does assume that the flavors aren't supposed to overwhelm the entirety of the dish. If the flavors to you are bland, then I might suggest a place that over-emphasizes sauces, like the Olive Garden. I do agree, the white wine sauce was a less flavorful as others in the past, but I hate tasting the butter in the sauce, its a big turn-off in a dish. You have to  consider you are paying for the seafood, not the sauce...By the way, the seafood tasted fresh as it could be, the mussels  were especially fresh and flavorful. The shrimp also had the flavor you would expect from an animal living in the sea. The seafood was executed flawlessly, thus improving the pasta dish exponentially. The linguini was also cooked perfectly. The wines we shared were paired perfectly for our dishes, and although expensive, really tied the flavors of our dishes together.Honestly, if you come here, get something that is special. If you get a simple marinara, spaghetti and meatball dish....just why bother? MAKE IT AT HOME, Lazy. Come here to enjoy something that is difficult to execute...that's why you eat out at a nice establishment in the first place. I hate seeing people complain that they can make it at home...Go home and let me try your outstanding dish, I can't wait to try it Emeril! **That sounds just like something Gordon Ramsey would say, with a few "stupid donkey's" mixed in.** ~Atmosphere/Service~Romantic...is what comes to mind, of course. Its a nice little spot with a cute little room for service, the tables are done up nice. No music is piped in, its a relaxing and calm atmosphere. The bar room area up front is done just right, its not too large/small or pushes into the main room ruining the vibes. High tops are available to sit at as well as a bar to walk up to. Our waitress Jen knew all the specials and did not rush through them on a busy V-Day night. Instead she took time to go over all the options and the wine selection. She provided us the best service I have had in a while from a server. She consistently would come up at the perfect time to check in on us, and she was so personable and friendly. When I mentioned the 10% check in offer (which i was unaware of until I checked in), she immediately gave me the discount with a smile. She received a big tip, she deserved it for making our night even more special. Also the busser was a gentleman, he quietly helped put grated cheese/pepper on our dishes and without us asking put our food in our to-go boxes. The service is excellent.~Extras/Rating~On an excellent note, you get 10% OFF IF YOU CHECK IN ON YELP! YAY! That 10% went right back to our awesome waitress, who got a good tip, haha. We also got a free Amaretto in a glass at the end of the night, really great touch to a wonderful dinner! This is a 4.5 out of 5 in my book, but I will knock it down to 4 stars because of the semi-bland sauce...But its a solid restaurant, instantly my personal favorite family-owned Italian spot. Jen once again was amazing, see if you can get her as your server. I highly recommend this spot!!
Nitty Gritty Middleton=Nuh uh. Nope. No no no. My daughter wanted to eat here for her birthday this year, having eaten at the one downtown successfully 4 years ago. Her birthday, her pick. Plus, she delights in the free mug of soda and balloon. She's a birthday sell-out and I think that must be how they suck you in. But, I digress. Our order took an aggravatingly long time to arrive and our glasses remained empty after having drunk their contents while waiting. There was a Packers game on and many of the wait staff were watching that. I don't know if that was the hold up, but it was a bit irritating. When our meals finally arrived, my children discovered that the insides of their burgers were very pink. Waaaaay too pink for medium well, which they ordered. It was scary pink and super soft--like raw hamburger generally is. When I told our waiter about it, he was completely uninterested in helping fix the situation, and instead, argued with me about it for quite a while, finally saying, "That's what medium well looks like" in a tone that suggested that I was simply too stupid to know the difference. I'm not. Finally I convinced him to humor me and take them back to be cooked through. He did so with a smidgen of contempt.As a side-note, my husband's burger was to be well done and was also pink, though not raw.Still no drink refills.No one offered a discount, a refund, a free soda while we waited, and especially not an apology. Obviously we won't be back.
Avanti=Hands down, my favorite restaurant of all time.  My grandparents have been going to Avanti since the 70's!  It does have a mobster vibe and I think I have actually seen mob activity there before, but that is what makes it unique. The service is impeccable and I have never had a bad meal. They have the best gnocchi I have ever put into my mouth, it is served in a pasta trio with other pastas of the day.  Another tasty dish is the osso bucco.  You really should try this place at least once.  It would be great for a nice date.  I don't think that they strictly enforce a dress code, but you'll want to dress up a little- not a baseball hat and jeans type of place. Also, you'll want to make a reservation.Based on a recommendation from a friend, we've dined here a few times.  This Italian joint reminds me of the Peppermill Restaurant in Vegas.  The dining room walls are covered in mirrors and the furniture is black and white.  It's dimly lit and has an intimate feel to it.  During our visits, we've had the following menu items:Escargots, $11.50Mozzarella Caprese, $12.00Spaghetti w/Meatballs & Sausage, $19.50http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/avanti-restaurant-of-distinction-phoenix?select=g6rybW0TkoO10ItXCbJDyg#g6rybW0TkoO10ItXCbJDygTortellini, Lasagna, Gnocchi (custom made sampler appetizer)http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/avanti-restaurant-of-distinction-phoenix?select=OnKBcxrDWW269Z9ZAQ0hRg#OnKBcxrDWW269Z9ZAQ0hRgTiramisuhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/avanti-restaurant-of-distinction-phoenix?select=BzrmZfblwrBYIB0-5JpAKw#BzrmZfblwrBYIB0-5JpAKwThe best part about our experience here is the service.  On one of our visits, when we asked the server if they had Gnocchi, he said "We don't have it as a separate dish, but we can make something for you".  The Better Half ordered a plate for dinner that evening.  On another visit, the server noticed that I was on the fence between the Lasagna, Gnocchi, and Tortellini....so he brought out a small sampler plate for me so I could try all 3 before I made my decision....awesome!As far as the food, it's pretty good.  My fav's are the Gnocchi, Tortellini, and the Spaghetti.  You can't go wrong with any of them.Return Factor - 87%Highly recommended Avanti was my choice for dinner while visiting Phoenix. Avanti is located in suburban Phoenix so it would definitely have to be a recommend. I don't know how else you would find this place. In any case, parking is plentiful. You walk into a "mid 50-60" decor with red walls and dim lighting. Servers are dressed in suits. White table cloth, complete table setting, sexy in its own way.Short menu (that is a plus) Short wine list (another plus) and a good selection of wines by the glass. The food wash acceptable. The osso bucco was tasty but could have been done a tinge more. I like it when the marrow is like a gel... Truthfully, went there for the gnocchi which was okay.there were several sauces you could choose from to lather the gnocchi. I chose a cream sauce... Sauce was too thick for my liking, which IMHO took away from the texture of the gnocchi itself.I would go back though...atmosphere nice, servers nice...  Repeat performance do-ableOk, so this was the first review I ever wrote on Yelp. This restaurant was the whole reason I even joined Yelp. It has and will always be my favorite restaurant in the valley. You may not get it, but that's because you probably suck. First off, this place is totally dated. It's dated because that's part of it's charm. This was the place to dine back in the 80's and early 90's. My grandfather only ate at 3 restaurants in the valley back then: Avanti, El Chorro on Lincoln, and Don & Charlie's. He liked being treated well and these places never missed a beat. Of course, times change, but this is why I will always love this restaurant. It has been consistently good my whole life. Also, it should be noted, if you treat your waiters well, they treat you well. Gramps was a big tipper and he got treated very well. When he made a reservation, he made it with the same waiter, for like 20 years. Ok, maybe not that long, but long enough that he saw my mom through two marriages and several relationships. Well, maybe 20 years isn't off the mark? His drink of choice, vodka on the rocks with anchovy stuffed olives, would be sitting at his table waiting by the time we sat down. Not many restaurants can pull that off. So yeah, I am probably biased. But I am biased because I have had some great times in this place over the years. To this day, I never order gnocchi anywhere else. It's always a disappointment. It's true, though, the vibe isn't the same as it once was. For one, nobody knows how to dine anymore. Dinner used to be an event. You ordered at least two rounds of drinks before you even considered ordering food. How are you supposed to get a buzz on otherwise? Then you would order some apps/starters, then a main course, then dessert and after dinner drinks. This is the kind of place you spent some time in. This is the kind of place that used to require some proper dining etiquette. I don't find this happening much anymore at Avanti. There hasn't even been a need for valet on my visits over the last several years. That's not a bad thing. Just an observation. Times are changing, and people don't have the money to spend on dinner they used to. One thing that hasn't changed, though, is the food. So I will continue to go back, even if I don't have the time to "dine." I will go back, even though it will always have to be without my grandfather. I will go back just to get a sliver of what this place used to be back in the day ... which was, wait for it, legendary.
The Bloomfield Sandwich Shop=I am beyond happy to finally review this sandwich shop.I've been here only once and it's beyond memorable: It was a late night saturday around 2am and my two friends and I were on a search for late night foods. Matt suggested the Sandwich Shop with a description of a "quiet, low key, good food atmosphere" which was much preferable of any other options at that early hour. So naturally, we are hungry after escaping the hipsters of Remedy we are down for some regular chill.We seat ourselves outside to wait out some of the crowd and drink the remainder of our 6 pack of PBR cans [remember we had just come from hipster/lawrenceville] when out of nowhere our simple pleasurable time is disturbed with the outbreak of a 10 person fight! [we got lucky because this is apparently unusual] -- there was even astonishment from the participants ["REALLY? We are having a fight at the Sandwiche Shoppe????" - yup pronounced that way]Anyways, there was much scramble to break up the fight and not stub out eyes with cigarette buds and the chefs did quite a job at driving the trouble makers away. Surprisingly, no cops came checking anything out just drove along liberty ave.Needless to say this delayed our now greatly awaited sandwiches which we received for free in the process. [we tipped very well that night] The guy making our food brought us our food and engaged us in a friendly chat for about 15 minutes [much needed to restore his nerves]. Also surprising, we were lucky enough not to be involved in this altercation. All together this was a great late night adventure, with dinner AND a show!!! Can't wait for the next visit.I stopped by yesterday for brunch with CM around 1pm.  I'd passed the Bloomfield Sandwich Shop countless times on my bike, and had often wondered about the food and the clientele.  When a friend cancelled alternate brunch plans with my on Fri., but I was still craving breakfast food, the idea occurred to me to finally check this place out.  I'm very glad that I finally did, given the sandwich shop provided me with one of the most memorable brunches I've had in PGH.This place is the definition of a hole-in-the-wall--it's very small inside, so expect to get cozy with the owners and other customers during your visit.  In true diner style, CM and I opted to sit at the counter.  Indeed, space was at such a premium that at a couple points, one of the owners placed dirty plates on the counter a bit closer than I'd like for a minute or two before proceeding to clean them.  As for the decor, the best way to describe it is flower child kitsch, with a dash of sports (indeed, surprisingly, the paper placemats contained sports trivia).  You really do feel as though you're in the owners' kitchen when you're here.  CM described it as organized chaos, which I thought was quite apt.As for the food, as far as I can tell, the sandwich shop offers the most inexpensive breakfast in PGH (aside from McD's, etc.)--everything on the menu is $5 or less, and the portions are generous.  Despite this, as others have mentioned, the quality of the food is quite good--on par with, if not better than, Pamela's, and leaps and bounds above EnP.  CM ordered a hobo cake, a breakfast sandwich consisting of eggs and cheese between two pancakes ($4.50), with bacon (+ $1.25), and I ordered the short stack of pancakes ($4.25) with Nutter Butter cookies and chocolate chips (+ $1.00).  Both entrees were delicious, and very satisfying, not to mention filling.  (In fact, CM fell into a carb coma shortly after going back to his place.)Although the food and prices are great, what really makes eating at the sandwich shop a real experience is the owners, Mike and Mama Ros.  Mike, who waited on us, has a great sense of humor, joking with us and making us feel like family from the time we walked in the door to the time we left--and even afterward (he greeted us again when he and Mama Ros were taking a break at the outside tables as we walked past on our way back to the car after taking a short walk).  From talking to him, we learned that he and Mama Ros have run the sandwich shop for 15 years (impressive!), and that he lived in San Jose, CA prior to moving to PGH.  We didn't get to talk to Mama Ros much, because she was working the grill at the time we were there and it was quite busy, but they both seem like great people.Needless to say, we had an awesome first experience at the Bloomfield Sandwich Shop, and look forward to returning for more.  While I'm tempted to award 5 stars, there were a few minor shortcomings on the food front (use of boxed pancake mix, lack of maple syrup), and the chaotic atmosphere may not be for everyone.  Having said that, if you're looking for cheap and plentiful portions of basic diner fare done well served up by friendly owners, check out this neighborhood institution--it won't let you down!  4.5 stars.I have walked past the Bloomfield Sandwich Shop a million times, but I never tried it.  I assumed it was a greasy and dive-y sandwich place, which is typically not my scene.After talking to Laura M., I decided to come here for breakfast with my family.  I was shocked at the low prices and even more shocked by the beyond friendly owners.  Customer service here is clearly a top priority, and these owners should be applauded for their awesome attitudes.  On top of that, the store has a very wide-range of hours.I ordered a bacon, egg, and cheese bagel, but I was quickly jealous when my dad's sandwich came out on homemade Italian bread!  All of the meals were cheap and good.The only caveat is that on a hot day, the inside of the Shop is stifling hot.  We enjoyed the outdoor seating, though.  I will definitley be back!
Soho=I really like SoHo.  First off, it's located on the north shore and close to everything.  Nice bar, friendly staff, sleek and modern.  Great place to watch a game, LCD screens everywhere.  Skip the other appetizers and start with the angry shrimp.  They do a really good job with a filet mignon.  The salmon picata looked yummy, but since it wasn't mine, I didn't get to taste it.  If you don't want a big meal, they have all the usual sandwiches and burgers.  For dessert, have the banana bread pudding or some yummy chocolate fudge cake!  Or, if you're not feeling fancy, just throw back a few beers and bacon cheddar burger.  It's that kind of place, too.We waited forever.Our food wasn't prepared properly (my husband's salmon wasn't cooked well like he asked. He sent it back and they literally just threw it in the microwave, heating the plate and leaving the inside still not cooked through...).Our server was overwhelmed (after a Steelers Game, but still... you should be used to this with the location)Giving a 2-star because my salad was ok, but that's about it. Definitely not coming back.
Bojangles Restaurant=(2.5 stars)I haven't had Bojangles since the early-mid 1990s when I was on vacation in the South.  Bojangles is a fried chicken chain in the Southeast region that would be similar in style and menu to a Popeyes.Connecting through the Charlotte Airport on my way back to LA, I knew I was going to stop at Bojangles to give their chicken a try (this Bojangles is located in Concourse B of the US Airways terminal).  Bojangles may be fast food and a chain, but at least it is a regional chain and provides something different than other nearby airport eateries such as Burger King, Chili's, Quizno's, and KFC.There is a sign posted that says the food gets out within minutes of ordering (to capitalize on those commuters who have to get-it-quick-and-go).  They delivered on their promise because the food came out really quick (less than a minute).  Service was also friendly and efficient.  They also seemed well-staffed to handle peak times.  It looked like many travelers were choosing Bojangles for their layover dining destination.Their individual meals were not in the $5 range, but they were under $10 (which is not bad considering that airport food is often overpriced).  Family meals were also available.  I had three pieces of chicken (2 thighs and a leg) with one side (mashed potatoes and gravy) and a biscuit.The chicken was quite crispy on the outside.  Often, fried chicken at fast food places can be overly fatty or skimpy on the meat, but there was a good portion of chicken meat on the thighs.  The dark meat had the appropriate amount of fat, but it was not too fatty.  The chicken was also juicy.Unfortunately, the chicken was a little bit bland and I was expecting more kick.  Popeyes has a nice spiciness to their chicken, but Bojangles' chicken (on the other hand) could have used a little more heat and seasoning.  Honey and hot sauce were available, which helped give the chicken more flavor.  There was some greasiness to the chicken, but it was fried chicken after all (that is kind of a given).The mashed potatoes were similar to the mashed potatoes you would find at KFC.  Same taste with that signature texture that can only be described as not real-mashed-potato-like.  The gravy at Bojangles had a little more flavor than KFC.  I'm fine with KFC mashed potatoes so I thought this side was okay.The biscuit was large and had a nice, crunchy golden brown top.  Unfortunately, the biscuit was quite dry.Airport food is often average quality, overpriced and the same everywhere.  I still can't figure out how there seem to be Cinnabons at most of the country's airports when they are so hard to find elsewhere.   Since Bojangles is a regional chain, I think it would definitely be worth trying if you are a fan of fried chicken and have some time to kill at the Charlotte Airport.(Irrelevant Note) I sat next to NFL QB Jimmy Clausen on the airplane back to LA and I was surprised that there were not many people in Charlotte who recognized him--especially considering that he was the Carolina Panthers' top draft pick just a few weeks ago.
Crave Sandwich Cafe & Catering=I have eaten here on several occasions for lunch, and I have mixed reviews about the place.  It's not horrible, but its not the greatest either.For starters, they are tucked away in a really weird spot.  Its in the ASU center, and if you did not know it was there, I really don't know how you would find it.  It's also a rather small location, so there is actually no seating inside the place.  All you can really do is place an order, and take it to go.The few times I have been in there, the service has been pleasant, but not great.  There is a guy who has waited on me before, and I believe he is either the owner, or a manager.  He's friendly and nice, but always involved in a conversation with someone else.  It seemed like the people that he was talking to were his friends, and I had to wait for him to finish talking to them before I could get any service.  Plus, its not like hes neccesarily "waiting" on them.  He's "shooting the breeze" so to say.  Can you say annoying?  Im on lunch hour here people, I don't have time to play games.  I just want to eat my lunch and be done with it, ya know?Anyways, they seem to have a decent menu of items, but the prices are ridiculously expensive.  I can't believe how much this guy charges for his sandwiches.  like $7 for a cheapo sandwich.  The food is good, and the portions are good, but I just find that its not worth the $7-$10 at all...plus you have no seating, and you ignore me when I come in?  yyyeeeaaa.
Aunt Chilada's=Bocce Ball's, that was a some spicy Tortillion!What do you think about when you think about Bocce? I know...my thoughts turn immediately to Mexican food, too!Aunt Chilada's has set up a bocce court right next to the walkway in the courtyard. When I first saw the bocce court, it was jarring...like walking by the sushi bar at Houston's...just because you can doesn't mean you should. But, someone near the top of the Chilada family may, in fact, be a marketing genius! That thing really got a workout while we were there the other day.The Beautiful Carin and I hadn't been back to Tia Chilada's in a year or so, but we needed to reconnoiter...my strong and handsome son, Zachary and his lovely wife, Sarah are visiting next week and they want to go (good memories of another great visit:)We wandered in at happy hour (absolutely the best time to visit the Chilada family). Lots of people drinking, eating chips and salsa, etc. (though not as many as past visits...the economy?). We had no trouble getting a nice table out in the patio area, so we could watch an Italian sports staple being played in a Mexican restaurant:)The people watching at Aunt Chilada's is wonderful..all walks of life, all shapes and sizes...all getting their drink on with cheap margarita's and cheaper cerveza:) It's a tried and true formula for the transition from drone infested, uptight (I know, a word right out of the 60's) work-a-day world to a somewhat more relaxed, slightly (or heavily) inebriated night-time world. So much fun to watch...esp. the guy with a six pack of margarita's under his belt, trying to bowl the bocce's. It would be pretty tough to generate a bocce injury, but I think he managed it:)The service was a pretty good...we never had to wait too long for refills and they kept the chips and salsa coming ( the flour tortilla chips are one of the best parts of Aunt Chilada's:)Carin had a serviceable chicken chimichanga, and I had something called a tortillion (which, interestingly enough is numeral based nomenclature for this dish, reflecting the number of calories per serving)...shredded beef, cheese, beans, tomatoes, bacon (bacon!!!!), wrapped in a giant tortilla, dipped in egg batter and deep-fried...it sounded better than it was, but I ate about  1/2 and brought the rest home (might still be in the fridge, growling at me...not sure..afraid to look:)Nope, it's not the best Mexican restaurant in town, and it's not the best bocce court you'll ever see, but combined, they make Aunt Chilada's a decent place to have a bite and a cocktail, and to play the games that people play:)Birthday party. 30 people. Buffet style.I wouldn't go there again, but it was nice enough for that night. Food wasn't spectacular, and there wasn't any sort of view.I guess it's a great place for a party, though.If only more restaurants could be like Aunt Chilada's. I'm happy that I have been able to visit several times and look forward to many more visits in the future!First of all, this place is oozing with history. Did you know that long before Arizona was even a state, this establishment used to be a brothel? Yes, a brothel! Well now, it's of course the furthest thing from a brothel but you can still feel the history living in the walls and parts of the restaurant feel like stepping into a different decade all together.Second of all, the environment. If there's a restaurant that screams party, this is it and I'm talking about a party for all ages. Whether you're visiting with family and looking for a lively establishment with plenty of patio seating, fun games and hearty food, or you're out with friends eager to share some laughs over margaritas, live music and trivia night, this restaurant's got your covered. This is the ideal restaurant for large parties, private parties and more. They have two very large patios with two outdoor bars, a huge indoor bar area, a spacious main dining room and a more private dining room in the back (that happens to be the original building that housed the brothel!) Third, let's talk about the activities. This restaurant knows how to keep their guests entertained! They have live music, trivia nights, bocce ball tournaments, chocolate fountains on Sundays, and special events including a fiesta bash on Cinco de Mayo...just to name a few. Fourth and finally, the food. The food is solid Americanized Mexican food. The Nachos are hefty, the pollo Fundido is cheesy & creamy and the quesadillas are a good greasy (the kind you want when eating a quesadilla). This food is exactly what I would expect and hope for when visiting Aunt Chilada's. It's the perfect type of food for this family-friendly, fiesta inspired establishment. PS - did you know that these fine folks also happen to own Rustlers Rooste...that awesome cowboy establishment in Tempe complete with a live bull, slide and two stepping? Yes, these folks know how to have fun!A friend of mine was staying at the Hilton next door and wanted to meet up for drinks and appetizers.  He suggested this place.  The name sounded cool, so I agreed and we met up on the patio.  After browsing the menu and discussing it with our server, we decided to order:Chips & Salsa (complimentary)http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/aunt-chiladas-phoenix?select=cLT5Wnz9Gp7PpSv8f6iwlg#cLT5Wnz9Gp7PpSv8f6iwlghttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/aunt-chiladas-phoenix?select=dV_M46k5280NMAqvRZt_HQ#dV_M46k5280NMAqvRZt_HQCheese Crisp, $6http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/aunt-chiladas-phoenix?select=LtpyLqMZkia9aPWfXvC4hw#LtpyLqMZkia9aPWfXvC4hwNachos (Pequeno), $8http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/aunt-chiladas-phoenix?select=VXfowISEUAeqLwrwY2rjAw#VXfowISEUAeqLwrwY2rjAwhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/aunt-chiladas-phoenix?select=DdwA5S7yePK3kdfctervSA#DdwA5S7yePK3kdfctervSAhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/aunt-chiladas-phoenix?select=hQjsDYxPVzIu-sYbjOiRXw#hQjsDYxPVzIu-sYbjOiRXwCheese Enchilada, $8.95http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/aunt-chiladas-phoenix?select=T6nvfwi5K01mipaE745_-w#T6nvfwi5K01mipaE745_-wThe Chips & Salsa were average, nothing special.  The Cheese Crisp was pretty good.  The Nachos were very good as well....they heap the toppings on it as you can see in the pictures above.  Of course, I had to try an Enchilada....how could I come to a place named Aunt Chilada's and not have one?!  The Cheese Enchilada I ordered was very good, above average.  Our server was very attentive and made sure our glasses remained full.  We dined on the patio around happy hour on a Wed evening, so it was full of business people after work.  The vibe was very fun and the weather perfect.Return Factor - 86%
Jerry's Restaurant=It's 4:00 am on a Friday, you've just finished listening to awesome music and drinking too much, you're starving and want some good comfort food to fill your gut and soak up that alcohol..... enter Jerry's.The place was open.  The place was clean.  The food was good.  The service was great.  The prices were great.  WAY better than a Denny's, better than most diner's I've been to, actually.I had ham and eggs and the plate was delicious.  The ham steak was gigantic, the eggs perfect, and hash browns were done just right... crispy and good.I went to Jerry's last night for dinner.  We always eat there and usually like the atmosphere.  This time there were protesters there with anti-Nazi signs.  They told me that a man was present signing books and speaking to a group of people.  His name is David Irving and he was invited to speak by the group about his beliefs that the Holocaust didn't happen.  And that Hitler never knew about the Jews being slaughtered.  This is sick and made me lose my appetite.  Why would a restaurant like Jerry's support a local Neo-Nazi group?  Apparently, they hold the monthly meetings of the group there as well.  I do not plan to return to this location for any meal in case I run across this type of hatred again.4.9.12 Since that time, I have been following the story of David Irving.  He has not returned to this restaurant again but went to a hotel near the airport maybe a year later.  It was guarded by the Phx police red squad.  At least the protesters wacked this mole back into his hole for now.
T Cook's Restaurant=Before you freak out at the 2 star rating, let me explain myself.  My scale usually goes like this - 3 stars is average (duh), a place I wouldn't necessarily put effort into going to but I wouldn't be totally disappointed if somehow I wound up there.  2 stars would be somewhere I likely wouldn't return and wouldn't recommend to others.  For what T Cooks is trying to be, it is not worth a return trip for me.  Not that the food, decor, service, or anything was that terrible, but for the price there are far better fine dining establishments.  There is absolutely no reason to choose T Cooks or allow others to choose it.  Ok - so this review is based solely on my experience at the wine bar/lounge area and not the actual restaurant.  I was meeting a group of friends here for a cozy cocktail before we all took off to our various locations of origin for the holidays.  On a Tuesday night at 7, the lounge area was PACKED.  I couldn't believe it.  I arrived with my husband and there was only one other person from our party at the bar.  So I scouted the place out and swooped in like a hawk when I saw a party vacate a nice plush couch in the back corner.   The decor is very cozy - wood fireplaces going, low lighting, oak tables, plush couches, beautiful patio - very Spanish villa.  But I guess that this place used to be a Spanish-villa influenced private estate, so no surprise there.  So after being seated, we waited for a server.  And waited.  We noticed only one server in the entire lounge, and people were literally lining up to talk to her, either to get her attention or to simply put in orders.  It turned out she was the only server for the whole lounge!  That's not her fault, but that is definitely some poor management right there.  We ordered some food off the lounge menu and some drinks and proceeded to enjoy ourselves with our friends over the course of the next 3 hours.  I started with the Pinot Grigio and my husband had the 007 martini (or the James Bond martini?  something like that).  Both were good.  For food, we selected the calamari in aioli, the charcuterie plate, and the tenderloin burger.  The calamari was interesting to say the least - the aioli was very watery and almost mayo-y, kind of like cole slaw.  Um, ok?  The tenderloin burger was very plain.  The boursin cheese was creative but it didn't do much to help.  The applewood smoked bacon could best be described as stale - it was extremely brittle, almost hurt to bite into.  It wasn't even that it was "crispy" because even when bacon is properly prepared crispy it's still a little chewy.  The charcuterie plate never came. Over the 3 hours, the crowd died down and we were able to enjoy a little more relaxing atmosphere.  But the service never improved.  Rarely did the server return to our table to check on us.  One of our friends ordered a tenderloin burger much later in the night, and it took almost 45 minutes to get to him.  After our first drinks, I ordered the Sauvingon Blanc and my husband the Russian Valley Pinot Noir.  The SB tasted like pickle juice and my husband exclaimed that it was potentially the worst PN he had ever had.     At the end of the night we got the check.  $117.  For a mediocre burger, strangely prepared calamari, a cocktail, a beer, and 4 glasses of wine between my husband and I (two of which were terrible). Not worth it. Worse, out of curiosity I took a look at the regular restaurant menu.  3 entrees with mushrooms (I hate mushrooms), 1 with duck (to which I'm allergic), and 2 were seafood (based on the calamari, I wouldn't go for the seafood).   So there is absolutely nothing here I would eat.  No reason to return, whatsoever.T Cook's used to be our "old faithful" when we had someone in from out of town and wanted to show them that Phoenix wasn't just about golf, corporate resorts and chain restaurants. The Royal Palms is still our go-to recommendation for visitors with a hefty budget. T Cooks, not so much.4-7 years ago, it was a 5-star review in my book. Although T Cook's is still usually a good meal, it's not a great meal, especially for the price. The menu has stopped going anywhere and the execution is spotty. On last visit, my ravioli appetizer even came out sans sauce on accident. And when you have things like Paella from a wood-fired oven on the menu, you'd expect them to taste inspired and authentic, but I'm usually let down. Their pesto and bread is still out of this world though. A meal in itself.My wife and I got engaged at the Royal Palms. For awhile, we made T Cook's our anniversary dinner. So we'll keep going back to TRP for the fireplaces and cocktails, but I think we'll hold off on T Cook's until we hear that things have changed for the better.I met a friend for here for cocktails a couple of weeks ago.When I got home and answered the query "where did you go for drinks?", I was reminded by the Beautiful Carin just exactly how long it had been since we had been to T Cook's for dinner...apparently a very long time:(Because, while I did remember having dinner there, I couldn't have told you the year or the time of year...luckily, I have the Beautiful Carin to remember these things for me:)You know, I don't why we haven't made it back to T Cook's a little more often!T Cook's is one of those rare places that can genuinely say "everything is good" when you ask for their recommendations:)Maybe it's just me, but the atmosphere, ambiance, service and food combine in subtle (but effective) ways to create a meal experience that you really don't find very often...T Cook's is a jewel:)I have heard that they went through a bit of rough patch, service and consistency-wise, but if our dinner last week is an indicator, they have solved any problems that they might have had:)I was lucky enough to miss any rough spots...3 years between visits will do that for you:)We had a 7:30 reservation, and by 7:38 we were drinking perfectly made, ice cold Ketel One martinis at the table, and enjoying our conversation (Carin is one of the most delightful conversationalists you could ever hope to meet...she still keeps me entertained and enchanted...we still have so much to talk about after all this time:)Onion soup, Lobster Bisque and pate started our meal (and could have completed it...it was so good...fortunately, I'm a big eater:)Carin had Poulet Rouge (Red Chicken? Seriously, the menu nomenclature people need to re-think that one...When I think of red chicken, I think of salmonella, but that's not what they mean:) I know, I know... they mean the chicken is red with pecan wood smoke, and it is and it's a terrific dish, but still...the name:)I had braised short ribs...perfectly done with a marvelous horseradish infused risotto cake:)...Inspired:)They also have some very pleasant and tasty sides:)We had brussel sprouts (that were nearly as good as the sprouts I make at home:)...and potato puree...and seared Foie Gras...decadent and wonderful:)I tried to get Carin to have the foie gras with me, but we differ in our opinions about foie gras, and so, I had to take the bullet and eat it all myself:)...That should make my cardiologist buddies happy:)Time really can stand still when you're having an evening like this...by the time we finished our shared Chocolate Napoleon and coffee, it was 10:30 and way past our bed time:)But such a pleasant evening...never any rush from the servers, never a wait for the next course...everything perfectly timed, completely unobtrusive (no, our conversation was never interrupted to inquire "do you love everything?":)It was worth staying up late for an evening as pleasant as this...and almost worth waiting three years for, too!But we won't wait three more years to swing by T Cook's again...they are just too good and right in the hood:)I dream of the day I have enough riches that I can hang out in places like Royal Palms regularly. I mean the night I showed up, well it was night, but it was also pouring down rain, and even through all of that Royal Palms was pretty enough to make me stop and look around before rushing in out of the weather. I headed into the bar to meet up with a few folks and the interior is just a beautiful space - warm and welcoming, and very classy. Bring people here that you want to impress.I, of course, had to order a glass of champagne and the lovely server brought it right to me. Perhaps she sensed I had been delayed at the airport that day before arriving to Phoenix for 7 hours? Or more likely they are just very good at what they do here. We immediately ordered since it was so late and I started with a pear, pecan, and blue cheese salad. For my main course I choose a seared Irish salmon that was served with leeks, tomato gratin, and a pea puree. It was all fantastic, but the tomato gratin made me want to invite the chef to move to LA with me. I mean no way could I afford that now, but a girl can dream!We finished by sharing a couple of desserts and the one I chose was the Florale. It was made with lychee mousse and was quite light and just a bit tart. All in all a delicious ending to a delicious meal.I am just going to leave at this: this is phoenix: people don't know better.When our server introduced us by saying the chef was on the iron chef program - I knew right then we were going to have a less then adequate meal.....When there was a plethora of shellfish and no game on the menu I knew we were going to have a less then adequate meal (this is ARIZONA in the winter y'all!) Escargot - really? in Arizona?Though menu items usually have spare descriptions I am used to elegant presentations with many components (a la Iruna). Especially all the "hype" around T.Cooks - alas my salad was mixed greens and sliced pears - yes mixed greens and sliced pears - made me giggle (then I remembered this was phoenix).So ordering the duck breast - I was thinking this will be okay - sigh - why was my duck breast rubbery? I am guessing after they seared the breast the chef/cook sliced it too fast neglecting to wait the minute for the meat to rest - forcing my duck breast to be inedible...Then I looked around the room (gasp) white haired old people abound - these folks are from Phoenix - ha! They are having a grand ol time - ok I won't dog them but how about the mousy haired frumpy chick next to us with the beaded topDessert - we may have had dessert - I think we did - it was that memorable.Service was lovely - our server was proper - that's nice - but I will trade bad service for excellent food any day of the week.So yea - this is not the place for good food-
La Sonorense Tortilla Factory=I'm a huge quesadilla fan. I'm also a big fan of fresh food. In addition to that, as often as possible I like to be a patron of the small locally held businesses in the area where I live. I like spending my money there because they spend their money here and we all know that's good for the local economy. Okay so here we go.This place has a pretty big blue sign on the front of the store. They have a half a dozen or so parking spaces of their own in front. It's nothing to look at but what goes on under the hood is pretty darn special. There is only about 5' x 12' of walking space in front of the counter. Directly in front of you when you walk in the door there are pork rinds, Cabeza, Cow Tongue and a few other traditional Mexican entrées nicely seasoned and cooked. In the back behind the counter you can see through an open door, a team of folks working hard and making tortillas. This is what I was here for. Now over to your right they have prepackaged in a few different denominations and sizes fresh tortillas made probably only earlier that day and packaged right there on the spot. I bought myself a dozen 12 inch flour tortillas for $1.98 . . . . I couldn't wait to rip open the package and try one right outside the store (I ended up eating three)  Yummy ! All I can say now is I don't know if I can go back to the ones I used to get at Fry's. If any of you have ever had fresh flower tortillas you already know what I'm talking about. Check it out for yourself!!
Best of Europe Meats & Deli=Cash ONLY This is a real deal deli, family owned and operated. They have just about everything you could ask for. I always get the sandwich, usually some type of smoked ham. They are large and usually can be a meal for two. The staff is wonderful and very helpful. There are only two 4top tables inside the deli. Cash ONLYThis deli may seem out of place as it is set in a corner lot dominated by a Food City and other Hispanic oriented businesses.  Those who went to the old Chompie's in the same shopping center might even have missed it.Have been getting lunch here for quite a few years now.  It is a real Old World family run deli.  The meats in here are wonderful.  I think a Polish family owns the place.The have a list of sandwiches that are all HUGE, super tasty and very affordable ( with tax around $7). Skip those chain subway shops and get a real sandwich here!As mentioned by Daren, this place might take cash only.  I think they do take debit cards, but you have to order a certain $ min....be safe and take cash.  This place gets busy at lunchtime and there are about 3 tables in here.  Better to take you grub to a less crowded spot to savor it in peace...Warning: You will go for lunch and want to buy about 10 lbs. of deli meat!
Peanutz=I am a pretty easygoing guy. I would've overlooked the fact(s) that:1. Jim Beam is your only bourbon. 2. For some reason two drinks came out to $9.90.* 3. Even with only 10 people in the bar, the music was absolutely deafening. 4. You charge a $3 cover for no discernible reason.5. Rolling blunts is apparently kosher inside the bar, but sharing, not so much.However, I can't let this slide: your claw machine is BULLSHIT. That is the weakest claw of all time, and there's no chance it is EVER picking up anything in that cage. I feel violated, and I want my dollar back. ___________*I think that's some sort of weird PA tax thing.
Umi=I took my boyfriend to get the Omakase dinner at Umi as a Christmas present - it seems like the best location to go for a special occasion, something really memorable.We made a reservation for a Saturday evening, and got a little dressed up - with the dim lighting and sleek decor, it's fun to wear something here besides regular ol' jeans.  The host was very friendly, taking our coats when we arrived, and our server was equally gracious.  Umi is a place with truly skilled service, one of the few places I've eaten in town with utterly professional staff.  They are knowledgeable and skillful, and they added tremendously to our dining experience.The Omakase dinner is pricey, I think around $85 per person for seven courses and dessert, which is what we got.  The eleven-course meal, at around $130, just seemed like too much for our first try at this.  Alas, time has passed since our meal and I failed to write the courses down anyway, but here's the general scoop: Most of the seven courses were prepared raw.  I'd say five out of seven.  There were 3-4 sashimi courses - just raw, unspeakably fresh fish dressed delicately in various sauces and flavorings.  One course was gently fried tempura rock shrimp, another was cooked - I want to say black cod, but the rest were sashimi or sushi, appearing incredibly simple but tasting complex.  We took our server's recommendation for sake - it was pricey, but floral and delicious.  My boyfriend raved about the meal as each course came and went - we both had a wonderful experience.  I will give it five stars, but I hesitate only because it was such a pricey experience.  I have no doubt that the fish was impeccably fresh and certainly worth paying for, but the bill for two of us was well over $200 including the sake.  And the food, while excellent, was extremely light and delicate.  Now I'm not a big fan of being stuffed to capacity, but with an $85 meal, I hoped to have a little bit more food.  I was also hoping to have a little more variety - perhaps this was my ignorance, but I was surprised that 4 of the courses were sashimi - just four thin, amazing pieces of fish on a plate.  They were all wonderful - but it was a lot of sashimi.  I was hoping for something more substantial, more bold, perhaps?But that doesn't change the fact that every bite of food we did have was of impeccable quality.  I'd recommend omakase only to those who are celebrating a special occasion, love raw fish, and are willing to pay over $100 per person for food and drink.  I think in the future, I'd come back and just order a variety of sashimi and maki.  And Umi was a class act, from start to finish, with outstanding service and chefs who are clearly passionate about their product.I can't believe I haven't reviewed this yet because it was simply incredible!Seriously folks, if you're looking for a nice night on the tahn, look no further!  And my words of advice: DO THE OMAKASE TASTING MENU!  There's really nothing more to tell you other than you will find it incredible, I guarantee!  The Omakase tasting menu is either a seven course or eleven course dinner with dessert.  It's indulgent and worth every penny (at $85 and $130 respectively).  The plates served to you are small, but honestly not as small as I thought they'd be and the desserts, seriously, massive!  We had the salmon tartare, sawara seared with hot sesame oil, fluke sashimi, black cod with miso, tuna shashimi rock shrimp tempura and an array of sashimi (toro, snapper, salmon, tuna and saward).  Honestly everything was fantastic and fresh, just like fish should be.   Like I said, the desserts were all amazing and most of the choices were very rich.  I really enjoyed the chocolate maki and the inventive house made ice creams.  The overall experience blew me away.  From the service, to the food to the atmosphere it's a perfect 5 star place and if you live here and haven't been, don't wait any longer!My omakase 11 course chef tasting was one of my most rememberable dining experiences in Pittsburgh. As he prepared our beginning courses, the chef and I spoke Chinese together talking of our time in Taiwan. As we entered our later courses, a couple from Taiwan sat down. We were all speaking Chinese together and had a really unique experience here in America. The food was absolutely amazing! I kept myself hydrated between courses with the lychee fiz, followed by glasses of prosecco. Each of the 11 courses was better than the previous one. If you are hesitating between the omakase tasting or the regular menu, I would definitely suggest for the 11 course option. You may still be hungry after 9 courses.  Troy Polamalu was in the dining room as well.
Famous Ray's Pizza=So before we dove into the rice pudding last night, I thought we should eat something with some more substance and nutrition... and although I'm not the biggest pizza fan, I swear I've heard somewhere that pizza is considered the perfect balanced meal!I did make a spinach salad to go along with it, but calling ahead to Ray's was quick and easy.  We ordered one large Sicilian cheese pizza (actually, Jared ordered it this way - I would've ordered some fun toppings but oh well) for the four of us to share.  Turns out it was plenty... One piece was just enough for me - they are big slices and even with the guys eating two slices each, there were a couple leftover slices too!Ray's was pretty impressive - if you like a little bit of grease on the pizza, Ray's delivers just that... I followed my friend's lead and blotted it a bit with a napkin before diving in and devouring my slice.  I would 100% take out from Ray's again... it was reasonably priced ($16.50 for a large - actually, that may be a bit pricey for pizza but since I don't eat it very often, I am kind of clueless); it travels well, and I bet leftovers are just as good if not better - actually, I'll find out today when I have them for lunch!Moved to Phoenix in July and as a native New Yorker, one of my greatest worries was that I wouldn't be able to find decent pizza anywhere. It may or may not have kept me up a night or two... ;)First day in Phoenix: I'm starving, the movers haven't arrived, and I don't have anything to consume in my new place.  I drive down the street and see Famous Ray's.  I say, "hell, you're gonna have to start somewhere." I go inside.  Typical NY style pizza joint.  Order at the counter, pay, get your drink, have a seat...they'll call you when it's ready. The folks working the counter are definitely from NY (in case you couldn't tell by their ridiculously strong accents and all of the NY sport posters strewn across the wall).  Getting a good vibe so far.My name is called and I eagerly retrieve my pizza.  It looks just like what I'd get in NY.  More good vibes!  I taste it and I'm in heaven.  Seriously, it's so good that I have never been to another pizza place since I moved to Phoenix because I honestly don't have to (or want to!).  They have an everyday special of 2 slices and a fountain drink for $5.00 (can't beat that with a stick). They don't do delivery (boo), but I don't care.  I'd drive 50 miles for this pizza.Seriously, I think the stars aligned on my first day in the Valley of the Sun.  How else could you possibly explain how I found my pizza soul mate on my very first day here???  Moral of the story is: if you want legit NY style pizza, Famous Rays is your place.
Reyna Foods=When I moved back to Pittsburgh from New York I found myself in constant withdrawal because I no longer had a taco truck on my block to satisfy my cravings.  I had pretty much lost hope in Pittsburgh until I came across Edgar's Taco stand at Reyna Foods.  These are probably the best tacos PIttsburgh has to offer.  The tacos are also picture perfect.  I have never seen such a beautiful taco.  Seriously.For only $5 (plus tax), you can get two tasty and fresh tacos.  The ingredients are super fresh, and the tacos are prepared on the spot.  The actual taco is a perfect blend, and they are packed full.  I got the carnitas and pollo tacos.  They meat was not spiced as well as I wanted, and they were a little too mild for my taste.  There also wasn't any sauce/salsa/etc. out, and this lead to a rather mild taco.  However, I plan to come back for the full experience soon.This is definitely the best place to find real deal tacos in Pittsburgh.  The staff was super friendly, and I can't wait to try the burritos as well!"Jalapeno tostadas...yum!" That was a tip I shared a while back, let me go just a little deeper. That Hot sauce you found, loved and could never locate again? Reyna's has it. Biggest hot sauce collection in town. The same goes for BBQ sauces, any Latin ingredient you can think of, salsas out the wazoo, HANDMADE tortillas and tortilla chips so good they supply the best Mexican restaurants in Pittsburgh, fresh salsas, scorpion lollipops (for your wild, still sweet self), loose beans, herbs and all sorts of goodies in bins in the back....including dried hibiscus flowers that I make my mango hibiscus daiquiris with!Whatever you need, Reyna's has it. If they don't, ask...they do their best to get it! And don't miss the taco stand outside or the restaurant downstairs. Whatever Reyna's does, it's top notch!
Barrington's=The wife and I visited Barrington's for our first anniversary dinner.  I cannot say enough good things about our experience.  While this is not the sort of location you dine at while on a budget, I can say with complete confidence that it is worth every penny.There are a lot of high end eateries in town that feel that they are expensive simply to be expensive, while the food may be good, the staff may be well trained, with ambiance well appointed, they still sometimes feel like they are trying to recreate something else.  Barrington's is not one of these restaurants.Our appetizers were excellent.  The beverages were poured and priced appropriately.  Our entrees were astronomical.  Erin had the bacon wrapped trout, a real treat, while I opted for their special - essentially lamb two ways (chop & cheek) - it turned out to be one of the best dishes I have ever ordered at a restaurant.Service was top notch.  Our server, noticing Erin was pregnant pre-empted any concerns by pointing out that what we ordered was baby friendly.   They are knowledgeable, not pushy, friendly and quick.  Woody was our server, I will request him in the future.The bottom line - if you are looking for a change of pace, something that will challenge you to try something different, but still comfortable, a place which will exceed expectations, which knows what they are doing and focuses on doing it 110% every time, I highly recommend you dine with the crew at Barrington's.Call ahead, do not expect seating to be available on the weekends without a reservation, you may be able to sit at the bar but a meal like this deserves a table.Bon apetite!WOW! All I can say is WOW! Up till now, Zebra was the best restaurant in Charlotte that I ate at. Now, it's Barrington's! My best friends were visiting from TN, and I wanted to treat them for their Birthdays (There were 3 of them visiting). I knew it wouldn't be cheap but what the heck....you only live once, right?Now understand that me and my group of friends are real "foodies." We've had the fortune at eating at some of the best restaurants in the country. Not bragging, just giving some context here. So we typically go "all out" when possible, and given the special nature of this night, we certainly went "all out."So, to start the dinner off, we ordered the French Onion soup AND TWO pasta dishes since I read that they are famous for their pasta. This was basically "for the table" (i.e., we made it family style). My GOD. The French Onion soup was nothing like I've ever had before. Obviously reconstructed to a fine, modern twist. It didn't have your regular "toasty cheese" on top. Oh no.....it had a fine "cheese FOAM" in the center which was like a rich, cheesy sour cream but way better. The Onions were sweet and savory. Just about the best I've ever had! The pasta? IF you ever come here, you've GOT to order the gnocchi! It was freakin phenomenal! Don't know how else to say it. It had fresh parmesan, braised veal and porcini mushrooms which was layered with elegant yet powerful flavors. That sounds contradictory......you get the picture. It was GREAT!As if the pasta and soup weren't enough, we also added the Foie Gras. I mean, how could you NOT order Foie Gras if it's on the menu! It was wrapped in Prosciutto, over a homemade fig bar surrounded by a blackberry sauce. Again, RIDICULOUSLY good!We're basically full at this point. BUT we've GOT to brave more food! So we got the Ashley Farms chicken, the Crispy Duck and the Beef Short Ribs. Again, WOW! My gourmand buddies BOTH said that it was the BEST duck they've ever had! And I assure you that we've eaten LOTS of little duckies in our lived. This one had to be brinned for days as it was UBER moist......practically melt in your mouth. Yet he kept the skin crispy. That my friends takes great cooking technique. Same with the chicken. The skin was the best part...you can see the bird was pressed down to ensure even cooking while getting the skin very crispy. Some of the best chicken I've ever had, and probably THE BEST my friend had. The shortribs were also delicious. Not the best I've ever had (that goes to Roy's out West), but certainly the best in Charlotte! Oh and just for you know what and giggles, we ordered all 3 of the side dishes: Truffle Mashed potatoes, Garlic Spinach and Roasted Mushroom. Verdict for the main courses and sides? Just incredible!Now we're WAY overstuffed. So we get dessert. Why not? We do "cut back" and only order 2 desserts (but 3 portions). My friends all got the warm chocolate pudding cake. This title is misleading......it's more like a souffle, a flour-less one! Everything is made in house, including their ice cream. This was a decadent dish, a dream for chocolate lovers. I got the warm cinnamon bun, with some of THE BEST ice cream I've ever had....a brown butter pecan ice cream. We all suggested to the waitress that the Chef sell this in the grocery stores. It was uber yummy! All over a CARAMEL drizzled bun.Now, here's what I think many people overlook. While the did have a decent and affordable wine list, my group and I are REAL oenophiles. Not snobs by any means, just true wine lovers. So I did some research and found out that Barrington's only charges a $20.00 corkage fee. This is VERY low for a high quality dining establishment. So I brought 3 very special wines from my cellar, and figured at $20/bottle, so $60.00 total for 3 wines that could have totaled $2000.00 in some restaurants (I told you we went all out). So I thought that was a steal. When I got the bill (yes, I paid!) I saw that they only charged me $20 for ALL the wine I brought! Again, WOW!Finally, I was STUNNED by the final bill. Here we go "all out" and I was thinking maybe $500.00 or something for the FOUR of us. But no, It was under $300.00. Not cheap by any means. BUT keep in mind that we ordered 3 appetizers, 2 full pasta dishes (which are entrees), 4 other entrees, all 3 sides, and 3 desserts. That my friends is a LOT of food. For under $300? For 4 people? I mean, you couldn't possibly order more food. This was a food lovers paradise and the bill was incredibly reasonable!Out in Las Vegas this mean would have been $1000.00+!!! I can NOT believe at how reasonable the prices are in this restaurant. Again, please keep in mind that this is a FINE DINING establishment! So when I say "reasonable" I'm comparing it to other restaurants of similar quality. From that perspective, it's a STEAL!Both my best male friends said it was THE BEST MEAL of their lives. It was in my Top 5 for sure.That is a TREMENDOUS compliment to the Chef and this restaurant.
Villa Tap=If you are looking for a no frills Friday night fish fry that will blow your mind, this is your place. I am giving this place 5 stars because it is wonderful for a very simple meal, with excellent service.  We had a little trouble finding the door (the entrance is in the back facing away from Packers Ave.) but once we walked in and sat at one of their wobbly tables, we were instantly greeted by our friendly server.  Though the bar was busy, we got our drinks immediately, along with a basket with two basic white bread rolls and coleslaw.  All very standard issue.  The fish was another story. Whoa.  I got the Canadian perch and my boyfriend got the Canadian walleye.  The large single piece of walleye was lightly breaded and fried perfectly.  It was buttery, non-fishy, and totally delicious.  The baked potato that came with it was pretty standard, but good.  The perch was battered differently in a thicker, more crunchy coating.  The little strips were just AMAZING.  I got a pile of 7 or 8 strips that I honestly couldn't stop eating.  The fries were done to perfection as well.  My boyfriend and I are somewhat light eaters in general, but we cleared out all of that fried goodness in one sitting.  On the way out the cooks from the back yelled good bye, the bartender wished us a good night, and someone standing by the door smiled and asked us to come back soon.  I can't say enough about how friendly everyone here is.  It looks like a burned out biker bar, but their simple menu is done right.  I never thought I would like a place so much that doesn't have salad on their menu, but I anticipate we will be back many many more times.
Cain's Saloon=HELLO new neighborhood watering hole!  This place is legit!  Moving to the new hood in Dormont means finding a new go to bar.  I need a my hood bar to have a good selection of beer (I accept Yuengling and hopefully a rotating seasonal list) and good bar food.  Good bar food doesn't have to be good.  I mean, it has to be good, but it doesn't have be gourmet poutine, if you know what I'm sayin'?  Cain's totally surprised me because they have a mega beer list, with lots of drafts on tap, and this particular night Southern Tier Pumking was in the hizzouse!  Their menu is HUGE too!  Tons of faves like wings and burgers but the intriguing "Codfather," which I will take part in at some point!  I was in the mood for a Rachel, because well, why not... it's my name!  The Rachel was awesome, with a good amount of turkey, but not overwhelming and lots of coleslaw, which is totally how I like it!  The rye was fresh and toasted and it all came together perfectly.  But the fries, the fries win my seal of approval!  They were crisp and seasoned correctly, which is a winning fry in my opinion.  I'll see you soon Cains, and will be working my way through your extensive draft list and food menu on the reg!
Souper Salad=After a trip to Target, we were hungry so my daughter and I stopped in for some dinner here.  She loves salad bars since she can pick out what she likes and just eat that.  It was about 8pm on a week night so they were not busy.  We were greeted warmly and paid then went to the salad bar.  Things had not been restocked but that's ok, there was still plenty and it was good.  They had some different salad....an oriental noodle one that I liked, and of course soup and bread.  For dessert they had the soft serve ice cream that is so yummy and lots of toppings to go with it.  The place was clean and the staff was nice.  It's nothing outstanding but it was good and we were full.  And it was fairly inexpensive too.
Marcellino Ristorante=I'm an  Italian girl from New York and I can honestly say: Marcellino is one of the BEST Italian restaurants in the Valley. If you like home made pasta, flavorful sauces, great wine and all the other elements that make a great Italian place - this is it! It even reminds me of a place back east with the owner (owner's wife?) working the door and the old school dessert ray presented by the waiter. Marcellino is not cheap, but it's price in on par with other high end Italian like Bravo Bistro, Um Bacio, Le Cabaffe, Tamasos...etc. But Marcellino might be the best!It is with pleasure that I bestow upon Marcellino Ristorante my coveted 5 star review                                                                                                                                                        *  *  * FANFARE *  *  *                  Where do I begin?  How about with the amuse busch (to build anticipation in the palette).  Moments after we received the menu a plate arrived with a couple wonderfully pungent olives, several small slices of some kind of salami and 4 small chunks of what I believe was pecorino cheese.  A delicious start and we had barely opened the menu.We shared the Gamberi e Feta antipasti.  Two HUGE jumbo shrimp (I didn't think the word jumbo really did those bad boys justice) grilled perfectly...tender and juicy.  They were served on a square of lightly fried feta cheese and a bed of cabbage.  The arrangement was so nice that I didn't want to disturb it.After that we shared 2 entrees:The Fagottino di Pollo and the Salmone in Crosta di Porcini con Cognac e Porri.  I am not a big fan of salmon but I could become a fan of this salmon.  Flaky, delicious fillet with a wonderful cognac sauce.  I was less thrilled with the chicken.  It was split chicken breasts layered with proscuitto and fontina cheese and smothered in a brown sauce.Here's the thing about the Fagottino di Pollo.  When I say I was less thrilled I mean it was 4 star chicken.  Everything else about the food and service was 5 stars.  Flat out.  We shared a couple desserts - a tirimisu and a dark chocolate mousse.  The tirimisu had all the right flavors working - mascarpone cheese, chocolate, espresso, rum, lady fingers.  Delicious.  The mousse was also very good.  Dangerously good.Along the way we had a very well rounded chianti ( Chianti "I Sodi", Badia Morrona ) and a very nice white ( Albana "Colle Del Re" ).  Even the brewed coffee I had after dessert was very good.Service was outstanding throughout the evening.  All in all I would place Marcellino Ristorante on the short list of Phoenix's finest restaurants.How can I not give Marcellino five stars?The food was fantastic - as was the experience.  We'd been hearing about Marcellino Ristorante for awhile but it wasn't until we were looking for a place to celebrate Mother's Day that we thought to check it out.From the moment I called to make a reservation, we received the friendliest service ever!  I was told that they could take our group at 6:45 and that they'd have a live Opera Singer (specifically a Tenor) in house that night performing - what a treat!  Well - that's what I figured when they told me that.  (None of us were opera fans before and we still are not opera fans, but it did add to the experience!)We were seated right away and Scott was our server.  He was attentive and patient with us, even when Jared had him repeat the specials several times.  Their homemade pasta specials looked incredible, but I stayed away... Instead, I enjoyed the Insalata Ortolana, a few bites of the Canestina Polenta (if you like polenta and you like mushrooms, get this - it's incredible), and I shared the Gamberi Affogtai entree with my mother-in-law-to-be.  We requested extra veggies instead of mashed potatoes and not only did they oblige, but the broccoli, cabbage, and asparagus we received were delicious!  The shrimp were magnificent as well - juicy and tender!  Oh - I have to also admit to having some of the 'special sauce' they serve with the bread basket... it is tangy and wonderful - if you go, you must try that too.  It's made with eggplant, olive oil, and red pepper I believe... yum!Jared and his sister had a Caprese Salad (a bit overpriced at $12.95), the Paccatelli al Ragu (a bolognese pasta dish I believe), the Scaloppine al Gorganzola (a veal dish that he enjoyed but serving size was not as big as he'd wished for).  We finished off the meal with an Apple Galetta served with hazelnut gelato and a Panna Cotta (similar to flan).  While I had just a small taste of the apple one, I can report that it was delicious... and since Jared and his mom finished off the panna cotta, i'll assume it was not so bad either.All of the above plus a pellegrino, a coffee, and a cappuccino for $159.85 before tip.  Note - no alcohol.So, yes, we wish it was more affordable - but we'll be back without a doubt!
Bombay Grille=I've been coming to Bombay Grille for more than 6 years now.  It never fails to surprise me every time that I pull into the place that it somehow keeps the lights on and stays in business.  Now let me be clear, I'm surprised it stays in business because every time I go there for lunch, it's dead.  Shocking really at any buffet, but especially at a buffet where the food is as good as it is here.  It's really really good.  The naan is fresh, the Chicken Kormi and chicken curry are delicious.  Any time they serve lamb, consider yourself lucky - it's amazing.  To top it off, they often have rice pudding available to finish off the destruction of your blood sugar.  It's great!  The only problem is that it usually has to sit on top of two plates of delicious food and soup which means your stomach is about to overflow.  The service is also respectable, and it seems as though the same 4 or 5 guys are always working, so if you're a regular, they'll recognize you.  The only reason it's not a 5 star place is the decor and cleanliness.  I'm not saying its dirty, but it's not sparkling, and the dimly lit dining room doesn't bestow confidence in germaphobes.  I would however recommend this place to any foodie type who knows that sometimes you have to look past some of the details to find the gems.
Ono Hawaiian BBQ=ONO doesn't begin to cover how amazing this food is!i grew up in Hawaii and, although NOTHING will ever stand up to the food on the island, this place comes pretty damn close as far as "plate lunch" goes.  the chicken katsu is good, the spam musubi (awesome snack when you're out surfing for the day...a personal fave) is wonderfully delicious...i LOVE the sauce they put under the spam...i'm thinking it's the katsu sauce, but i could be wrong.  my fave tho is the island curry chicken.  it has a kick, but it's freakin AWESOME!  the macaroni salad is to die for...my advice, if you're feeling naughty, skip the rice and ask for two scoops of the macaroni salad...totally worth the calories.oh, more advice.  go for the mini meal.  it might sound small, but it is the PERFECT size!  just enough to fill you up!mahalo to whatever lolo brought this grub out to all the haoles in phx!When you are in the mood for some light food, that is very flavor filled. Then Ono is the place. Teresa showed me this place, other wise I would of never known.It is tucked away in a shopping center on Thomas.Busy place and now that I have been here a few times, I have to say it is always good. I like it to go though, because, it is always so busy and so much noise. I just feel better taking it home.The Macoroni Salad is really good. It is great food to take on a picnic or an outing.The food is very fresh as well. Probaly because, they do such a great business nothing has time to get old. It is worth the time to check this place out, Bra!
Au Petit Four=I stopped by for a ham and cheese croissant two weeks ago, and I can't recall the last time I felt so ripped off.  I actually wanted to get my hazelnut royale fix, but balked at the price tag- $6 a piece!  After a few minutes, the male owner talked me into trying the croissant.  After he heated it up in the microwave, he charged me $8, plus tax, which I felt was too much, esp. for a croissant that is almost a day old.  I wished it was more crispy, but since it was microwaved, the bottom was very soggy, and only the very top layers were slightly crispy.  After a few bites, I perused through tthe take-out menu and couldn't find the croissant under the dinner menu; Instead, I found it under the breakfast menu- $5.95 with white sauce, and $6.55 with scrambled eggs.  So I was charged $8 for a plain ham and cheese croissant that was a breakfast leftover??  I left very disappointed with my dinner selection that day, and with ever-increasing prices, I won't be coming back soon, if ever.Bonjour ooo la la yummeee, If you like fresh made from scratch daily french pastries this is where the magic happens! Oh they also Cater!I have been coming here since they first opened Catherine and her husband Pierre are Tre' sweet! They always have a tasty variety and they are very good at making suggestions that will satisfy whatever it is you have a taste for. Excusez-moi Aileen B, It is a fresh croissant house made throughout the day and it's with black forrest ham and imported cheese, at the Esplanade you got off cheap for 8.00. Starbucks has a tiny turkey and swiss for 6 bucks and it's not on homemade anything. I eat here at least once a week, love the baguettes. They also make olive bread which is Divine! Katharine makes the best scrambled eggs! I also love the salmon sanwich (yes that's french for sandwich lol) on a baguette. My grandparents came to visit from Illinois. I brought them here for lunch. 1st because I love it and 2nd my grandfather is from Lens, France. He loved everything he had and said the baguette reminded him of his mothers. He also enjoyed speaking a little french with Pierre and Catherine. He is a little rusty in the french department. Au Petit Four makes me proud to be 1/4th french. Au revoir, Bon appétit!Pricey due to high esplanade rent. Great stop before or after your AMC. Choose pastries not baguette. --wow. $65 for two sandwiches with side salads, bottle of lemonade, sparkling water and dessert.  --baguettes not authentic. --pasta salad bland--but its all about the bread for a proper sandwich mixte avec crudities. And this bread was NOT it. --great cafe feel and French owners lend authenticity--worth it for the the pastries. Still on a quest for the proper French baguette.Au Petit Four makes its home in an unassuming location within the Esplanade. This is a great little bakery and the perfect caffeine fix during the workday. While I haven't had a chance to try their croissants and baked goods, they smelled delicious and I'm counting the days until my return. Their iced coffee is spectacular. The sugar free vanilla and Carmel is straight from France and it makes the perfect blend of refreshing coffee with a huge caffeinated kick. The staff is friendly and they have great seating to stay for awhile and do work. So in summary, Au Petit Four is tres bon for baking, coffee and work essentials and I look forward to coming back and trying out their food!Beware being ripped off at Au Petit Four!  If only i can give no star, i would.  We dined late on a Saturday night. We were the only table in the restaurant.  The desserts were good, but very expensive- (1) coffee $2.00, (2) Arrowhead water $2.00, (1) Lorina lemonade $3.50, (1) mango mousse cake, (2) Creme brûlées, (1) chocolate chip cookie, (1) white cake, all total to $48.50.  It was an indication when there were no price tags for the desserts.  The owner didn't even give us an actual bill, but just came by to tell us the total.  We were all pretty tired and didn't give too much thought of the amounts. I am extremely disappointed, SHAME ON YOU AU PETIT FOUR!Review 2/5/12We were searching for a place to end the night with dessert.  We found Au Petit Four on Yelp and their were .4 miles from where we were.  COOL!  And we had their desserts before at the Esplanda location, so we know the the stuff is good.  Parking was almost impossible.  It is hard to find a space but we have a promise of good desserts so we grab the kids and walked.  They have only been in the new location for 6 weeks.  It was pretty nice.  So we all walked to the dessert case.  Everything looked good.  We settled on:1 Coffee, 3 Bottled waters, 1 Lemonade, 1 mango cake, 2 creme brulees, 1 white chocolate cake, and 1 large chocolate chip cookie.  There wasn't a pricing for any of the things we ordered, so when he came to tell us our bill was $48.50.  We were shocked.  WHAT?  No detailed bill?  The kids were tired and we just wanted to leave.  10 items for $48.50 = Average $4.85 per item since we don't know the prices (non alcohol drinks and dessert)!  REALLY?????  I feel a little ripped off.Who are these penny squeezing, sour puss, little fusspots on a mission to slander this place? HERE'S THE TRUTH: the owner, PIERRE (yes, that's right, the most French name any Frenchman could have) is from Lyons, France (that's right, the culinary capital) and is passionate about good food. His pastries are fantastic. They have a new FRENCH chef who makes amazing and authentic French food.  -- Are you getting the theme here: FRENCH from FRANCE!!!It is superb food. The owner couldn't be nicer. Service was excellent. And, here's the deal with the prices. The have this thing called a 'menu' which lists, in an itemized fashion, adjacent to each dish, the PRICE. You can actually calculate what the bill will be by summing each item ordered, adding tax and tip. -- I know, completely crazy new concept; but they have it here, and it works beautifully. That way, you won't be shocked by the prices. Another thing: This is SCOTTSDALE, which is like the Beverly Hills of Arizona. Real estate is expensive; the clientele expects good product and pays for it. You don't walk into Barneys of NY and SCREAM how frigg'n expensive it is and how you can get pants in Walmart for a fraction of the price. -That would reflect poorly on YOU, not Barneys. -- Same goes for this place. Bottom line: GREAT food, GREAT service, STUPID reviewers.
T-Bones On the Lake=I'm so over T-Bones.I used to relish the thought of hanging out on their big deck on one of the first warm days of the year, treating myself to their yummy grilled chicken salad or wings--the only 2 things on their menu that I liked.  I was even willing to tolerate the funky smell of the main restaurant on my way out to the deck.  But the last 3 times I've been to T-Bones, the food and service have been awful.  And they changed the menu, removing the grilled chicken breast salad that I liked.  The sweet tea was almost as clear as water, and painfully sweet--undrinkable.I'm sorry, T-Bones.  We tried to make it work, but it takes two.  Please stop relying on the fact that you're the only place (I know of) in the area where you can eat the water's edge.  It's just not enough to keep us coming anymore.  You actually have to serve good food and decent drinks.Great atmosphere and location, but the food is sad, just sad. Won't be coming back. It's fine if you want to enjoy a few beers by the water, but don't come hungry.What on earth has happened to T Bones?! This used to be an awesome place back in the late 90's and I used to hang here all the time.  It's been years and years since I have been and wanted to take my husband for dinner. The first thing that hits you is the smell when you walk in the lobby.  It's fishy, but it's not coming from the lake.  The place needs a complete professional, deep detailed cleaning. There is dust and cobwebs everywhere and a thick film of just nastiness on the surfaces.  The menus are dirty and sticky. They were not busy. Our waitress was young and was way more interested with her phone and the male waitstaff than providing us good service. I remembered the filet tips being amazing and my husband wanted to try something new so he got a peanut chicken sandwich. The filet tip meal did not come with a salad and was almost $20.  That was pretty lame. We got our food and it was on dollar store plates and very sad looking.  The portions were small and the peppers, mushrooms and onions that were with my tips were overcooked and soggy and the steak was overcooked.  I was bummed. My husband was so confused with his sandwich.  It was a small piece of dry chicken with weird slaw, hot sauce and a HUGE scoop of peanut butter - the ingredients did not go together at all.  We would have told the waitress, but she didn't come back until we were almost done. I did ask for bread because I also remember it being awesome and should have came with my meal.  It was old and cold and was sitting in a sad basket wrapped with a old linen.  It was half a loaf of mini bread with no knife. We used our hands to share it.In short, this place has gone waaaaay down hill over the years and the owners don't seem to care. It's dirty, overpriced and the service is poor. I guess it is just another spot (like all the other bars in Lake Wylie) for locals to sit and drink outside. It's too bad, I remember when there would be a line out the door and inside and outside would be packed on the weekends and the food was really good. Nice location, but I will never go back again.One star!  Let me begin by saying I've been coming to this restaurant since it opened, sometime in early 90's.  It appears that the joint hasn't been remodeled or thoroughly cleaned since opening day.  The place is absolutely filthy.  Really had a hard time not just walking out, but I wasn't alone so I stuck it out.  Terrible atmosphere.  Very musty, all the decorations appear to be from the early 90's.  The windows are dirty.  The floors are dirty.  The doors are sticky.  You can tell that the place is wiped down but never deep cleaned.  So now to the food.  I had a Carolina burger. It was tasteless, unseasoned, and poorly made.  Tasted nothing like a Carolina burger should.  The slaw had carrots in it which is weird on a burger and I've never seen carrots in homemade burger cole slaw.  The chili was tasteless.  The bun was tasteless.  Bad all the way around.  The burger was low grade meat, more suited for McDonalds and truthfully tasted worse than a McDonalds burger but cost me 10.00.  What a sham.  That burger cost them 2.00 and they charged 9.99.  Which I'll gladly pay for a fresh ground beef patty.  Pitiful excuse for a restaurant. No leadership in this place.  I really don't understand this business plan because they are adjacent to some of the highest value homes in Charlotte.  Just clean the place and serve fresh food.  I'll never return.As a bar with a nice view of the Lake, it's not bad although the lake is way down at this point and a large amount of the grassy area around the restaurant were under two to six feet of water six months ago.Meet a former colleage from work for lunch today.  I had their version of a Cuban called a Pork Loin Sandwich.  Not bad except for the cole slaw.  I know cole slaw is a Carolina thiing but you don't have to put it on everything.  Otherwise it was excellent and the fries that came with it were pretty good as well.My friend  had a pound of wings with hot sauce and he really enjoyed them.Food was OK, not outstanding, the bar scene was good and the servers were outstanding. We ate at the bar on the outside deck and it was pleasant.  Warm but not too hot with a great view.
Monty's Blue Plate Diner=Monty's is one of the many mind-boggling Food Fight restaurants that is a Madison favorite despite serving mediocre food. I've eaten one good dish here: the TNT BLT (tempeh and tomato). And the chocolate shake is good if you need to consume an extraordinary number of calories on any given day.The last time I went, I did so because a friend told me the restaurant is attempting to make a switch to more sustainability-conscious, organic food. I ordered chili that was pretty much inedible. On another night, my boyfriend ordered a soup that was, again, inedible. I can imagine that people like to come here because the restaurant resembles an old-school diner and has booths, which are fun for kids to sit in. But the food quality is generally average to poor. The brunch I've had is tasteless and limited, and you are not getting fresh eggs unless you order them over easy. The only reason I give Monty's two stars is because its pies are great. And once in a while, I can stomach a TNT BLT because someone I'm with persuades me to give Monty's one . . . more . . . try.Monty's has quickly become my "can you" place. What do I mean by that..."You know your chocolate malt pie... can you turn that into a shake?" YES"You know the fried onions that come on the open faced meatloaf sandwich... can you put those on a burger?" YES"You know the biscuit that comes with some breakfast items... can I swap my diner roll for a biscuit?" YESThe staff is extremely friendly, always up for great conversation and recently I've taken to sitting at the counter which is a blast... your meal comes with a free show!So when I say Monty's is my "can you" place, I mean it's a place that doesn't mind me being a brat. And if they ever say no? That'll be ok with me. I may go once a week instead of my typical 3-4 (seriously how does that happen?) but I'll still go!Ok, this is bad news (for me and my waistline)... Second visit to Monte's was 1/27/14 for "dinner," although I was there for some breakfast vittles.+ Breakfast ALL FREAKING DAY, EVERY FREAKING DAY - hip hip hooray+ Excellent variety of breakfast grub+ Reasonable prices+ Servers have been friendly, efficient, and professional - just the right "warmth"+ Atmosphere is classic diner; very familiar feel to it+ Obviously shares a connection with Hubbard Ave Diner (both are FF restaurants)+ Sweet Potato Hash: perfectly seasoned, nice slight char on the veggies, eggs were ever-so-slightly overcooked but still good+ Breakfast Burrito: I'm a sucker for these things; chorizo is just a touch greasy; left a little film in the mouth, but that's chorizo for you... + Good coffee, with speedy refillsI've heard the shakes and burgers are good; I'm too in love with the breakfast fare to venture to that side of the menu, but who knows... I'll give into temptation at some point, I'm sure.After this morning BK breakfast fiasco, I still wanted breakfast.  This place is like Campbell's soup good mmmm mmm mmmm. I had country breakfast plate eggs  and bacon cooked perfect. Don't judge but also had blueberry pancakes. My gf had the blue plate omelet( the yummy one with avacados). I can't say enough how great the food and service was. Love great diner's like this.
Wilson's Bar-B-Q=I stopped by yesterday at around 5:30 with CM to grab some dinner after spending the afternoon at the Aviary.  I'd wanted to try Wilson's last weekend before a visit to the Mattress Factory, but wasn't able to because we lacked cash, and Wilson's is a cash only establishment.  This time, we came prepared with plenty of green, so we were able to get our BBQ bliss on.In case you don't notice the heady odor of smoked meat when approaching Wilson's, it literally hits you in the face as soon as you walk in.  I first inquired about the chicken, but was told by the gentleman working behind the counter (presumably Mr. Wilson) that they were out of it for the day.  Thus, CM and I decided to split a large plate of ribs (around $12), which comes with 6 bones.  Because we'd heard that Wilson's hot sauce is seriously hot, we ordered a mix of hot and mild sauce for the ribs.  For sides, we decided to order the collard greens and the potato salad ($1.34 each), and I got a can of iced tea, as well ($1).  Because he's still having some trouble breathing from his ongoing cold, CM requested that we get our items to go, so I obliged.After finding a picnic table in West Park commons with a little help from a local resident, we unpacked the food and dug in.  We first tried the ribs, and found them appropriately smoky and the right texture, with sufficient give but not falling apart.  The sauce was just the right level of spiciness to satisfy both of us, as well--spicy enough to provide a nice kick, but not so spicy as to be overwhelming.  After finishing the ribs, we both used the slices of white bread provided to soak up the remaining sauce.  As for the sides, they were clearly homemade and of good quality and flavor, though the potato salad was a bit mushier than I'm accustomed to, and the collards were a bit saltier than I'd like.Overall, we were quite pleased with the quality and amount of food that we received for the price that we paid (around $16).  Make no mistake: Wilson's is a hole in the wall, but in the best sense of the phrase--check it out for solid, unpretentious BBQ that hits the spot for a casual picnic lunch or dinner if you happen to be in the area.
Peppi's=I finally tested Peppi's out last week in the Strip District on a Saturday afternoon.  Living in Squirrel Hill and going to school at CMU, I am a die-hard fan of Uncle Sam's subs, and I go there quite frequently.  I'm surprised that no one has compared Peppi's and Uncle Sam's because they are practically identical, minus Uncle Sam's throwing in free fries if you eat in.I ordered a cheesesteak ($7.22 w tax), after all of the cashiers agreed that it was one of the best sandwiches on the menu.  As promised, it was a delicious sandwich.  The bread was nice and fresh and the steak was good.  Additionally, the people working there were very friendly as well.  The portion was huge, and I got a meal and a snack out of my sub.If you are looking for a quick sit-down or to-go lunch, Peppi's is a great place in the Strip for just that.
Ole Brass Rail=I remember driving by this bar a couple of years ago and laughing out loud because the parking lot was packed at 8am.  I was asking myself, who the HELL *are* these people, getting loaded this early?!Fast forward two years later, and I've become one of "those people"  Well, with the caveat that I'm not getting loaded.Now I figger that my excuse is about as good as they come.  I'm working nights from 6pm to 6am, and after putting in a 12 hour shift, sometimes a man wants to have a damn drink, get something to eat, read the newspaper, relax a bit.  This avoids the unwelcome alternative of "unwinding" by drinking at home alone at 7am,  which tends to generate feelings of being a total loser.So anyway, ye Old Brass Rail opens bright and early at 6am, which is perfect.  As with any bar opening at this hour, there is your contingent of old man alkeeholic regulars, but this particular place also seems to be popular with the nurses getting off the night shift at a nearby hospital.  They usually enter in groups of 2-4, ordering double long island ice teas, and getting their drink on in their scrubs.  Some of them are even cute.The service is attentive and low-key.  Drinks are cheap and there are several breakfast specials available for under $5.   The food is nothing amazing but it gets the job done and the price is definitely right.   The first time I walked out of there after paying $7 for breakfast with a tall  gin and grapefruit juice, I knew that I had found a winner.There is a smoking patio with misters, but much to my dismay I got bawled out one day for taking a plate of pancakes out there. APPARENTLY, there is no food served on the patio, nor is the consumption of food that you have brought out to the patio yourself tolerated.  The reason given was pretty lame too, it basically boiled down to the fact that they didn't want to deal with people bitching about smoke ruining their breakfast, or something, blah blah blah.   So far, that has been my only negative experience at this place.The joint could use face lift, like another reviewer mentioned, but doing so might erase some of its character.Just watch your step on the way out the door, there's a slight incline that's easy to get tripped up on. :-O  Regulars will back me up on this.
Baby Kay's Cajun Kitchen=I've never had Cajun food in Louisiana so I can't make a comparison even if I wanted to, which I don't.  It seems a lot of people like to complain about ethnic food being Americanized or regional styles not living up to expectations.  We live in Phoenix people-Phoenix, AZ, USA, not Phoenix, Japan or Phoenix, New York.  I have eaten Mexican food in Kentucky of all places.  Was it the style of food I am used to being a native Arizonan?  No, but I can appreciate that it wasn't bad, just someone else's interpretation.So, the end result is I like Baby Kay's.  I've eaten here several times and never had a dish I didn't like, nor bad service.  I like that their hushpuppies actually have flavor beyond that of a wad of cornmeal.  I like the gumbo and jambalaya.  I tried the crawfish ettouffe and it was great.  I like that the potato salad is not swimming in some overly sweetened mayo concoction.So while it may or may not compare to your version of authentic Cajun cooking, it is still a great place for a meal.Oyster po'boy, bitches!  Thick, juicy hunks of oyster, lightly battered and fried, then put on a toasted hoagie roll.  Served with homemade potato chips, a pile of sweet pickle slices and a side of the remoulade sauce.  The sauce is what makes it!  It's a horseradish sauce and yummy!  I poured a bit of it over my sandwich.  It's obviously the specialty of the house, because our server asked each of us if we wanted it on the side.Oysters were big, juicy and firm, not too much so, though.  Nothing like oysters that aren't edible.  I've had them elsewhere and it's really disgusting.I just burped and it tasted like the po'boy.  All the boys at work are jealous.
Juliana Pizza Family Restaurant=I am confused. I am baffled. I am in shock. I am disappointed.  When I read the reviews I was a little surprised but I figured somehow I must have looked over this place after all these years and I was actually regretting it!  Now...not so much. I quickly realized there was a reason I grew up right around the corner yet never visited this place.  I realized there was a reason I never even stepped foot in this place on a lunch break while working at the neighboring Food Lion as a squeaky teenager with braces. Back then I thought Ragu was gourmet so I wasn't even picky but STILL knew to stay away from Juliana's  There is a reason why our Italian family of 7 never bothered ordering from here even though it was cheap and close by!  You have to realize this was before the restaurant scene really even popped off in Charlotte!! There were no options!  Uptown was downtown, the arboretum was for the wealthy and Ballantyne didn't exist.  But still....Juliana's was never an option....now I see WHY!!We opened the door and immediately fell back into 1973.  The diner feel of this place gave me the creeps and the whole restaurant turned to stare as we entered.  It was awkwardly quiet and just didn't have a comfortable feel AT ALL.  I wanted to leave from the moment I stepped in but I figured I needed to get over myself and give it a try.  Sometimes the best food comes out of little hole in the wall restaurants.  I wasn't expecting much but I realize decor is not the only thing that matters.We decided to stick with the absolute basic.  I ordered Spaghetti and meatballs and my husband ordered the chicken parm 12 inch sub.  My husband isn't as picky as I am so I was counting on him to enjoy this sub.  It is pretty hard to mess up a chicken parm sub.My pasta came out and all I can tell you is that the sauce was brown.  It looked like gravy.  When I mixed it in with the spaghetti it somehow just vanished so it was basically like eating noodles with a hint of brown gravy.  It was the most disgusting thing I have ever tasted.  I took one bite of the meatball and thought I was going to throw up.  It was atrocious.  It was spongey and tasted like deer meat.  It was so gross.  My husband's chicken parm sub had the same doo-doo brown gravy on it and the chicken was like rubber.  Literally.  He could hardly bite through it.  When he said he couldn't eat this sub, I KNEW it was bad.  He eats anything.  I for darn sure wasn't eating my dish so we just sat their staring at each other.  I forgot to mention the salad and texas toast that was served with the meal...the salad was frozen iceburg with nothing else and the toast was a piece of lilly white bread with some butter and garlic slapped on it.  BLLLLEH!!!!Eventually the waitress made her way over to us and we weren't sure what to say but I can tell you I have only not been able to eat a meal due to COMPLETE dissatisfaction twice in my whole life.  The waitress noticed that we didn't eat our meals and asked if we wanted a box to go.  Um, WOW.  No, we want to just get out of here.  We asked for our check and told her we weren't really satisfied but that we didn't want to make a big deal, no need for managers, etc.  Well, one of the "managers" (son to the woman who owns and cooks) came over.  He offered us anything else off the menu to replace our meals.  We didn't want anything else from this dump.  We wanted to just LEAVE and go eat.  We were starving and on a time crunch.  Long story short--They made us pay for the meal that we didn't even touch.  The owner came out and was extremely nasty.  She said she posted that they do not refund for food.  She then pointed to this itty bitty note on her cash register.  She said she can't please everyone's taste buds so she is not going to refund anyone.  What?  So does this happen often enough that you have to have a disclaimer on your food?  That is TERRIBLE servie for a small mom and pop, or just mom shop.  It was like they were used to people not liking their food so they were prepared to argue their point.  IT was bizarre.  I don't understand that concept.  They said you can order a pizza or something else so they are still losing money by having to make a whole other meal!  Either way, it was their approach and the fact that the food was absolutely disgusting.  I would NEVER want to support this place, local or not.I asked them where they were from because no one that was born and raised in Italy would have created the mess that they did.  They were actually greek.  I suppose they just have a different way of preparing Italian food because it was NOT authentic.I looked back at those who offered such stellar reviews and realized that most of the people were from random towns/areas.  Maybe they haven't been exposed to the real deal in terms of Italian food so somehow this place was okay to them.  Not me.  I'm telling you...If you love Italian food and have had real authentic Italian food...DO NOT GO HERE.  End of story
Tutti Santi=It's simple............. I don't believe I've given 5-stars to an Italian restaurant since Yelping, until now! I can only hope that if you're in Phoenix, and you try any of their locations, your meal will be as great as our's.And for us, the revelation of why this meal was sooo good, went back to the source; fresh ingredients. And how do we know that Tutti Santi cooks with fresh ingredients, like fresh picked basil from their own garden? Because Nina, the 80 year "young" owner shared that, and a few other secrets with us, at our table.  It might have been the comment that the gnocchi was absolutely as good as my wife's....... and THAT COMMENT was made in front of my wife! The word must've gone from our lips, to the server, to the kitchen......... to Nina herself! Because from then on, it was more than just a great Italian dinner experience. It was a great Italian dinner experience with "Nina." She left the kitchen, and came to our table, sharing some cooking, and life, experiences, and also sharing how she comes into the restaurant as early as 4am, just to make their fresh pastas..... and that great gnocchi. I couldn't believe her energy and spunk! Waiter........ I'm having whatever Nina's having for breakfast!!!And yes, we started by ordering their "famous gnocchi appetizer." You've got to order the gnocchi; either the appetizer or the entree! Enough said on that. We then followed with one of the specials; Penne pasta with chicken and Italian sausage in a pink sauce. It was DELICIOUS... and I could taste the very traditional Italian sausage, which was perfectly seasoned. And the chicken? It was white meat strips that had an incredibly fresh taste, and wonderful texture. Our other dish was their eggplant parm. And just how good was that? My wife commented that it melted in her mouth; the best version of eggplant parm she's ever had. And it came with a very generous serving of spaghetti pomadoro. The pomodoro is a basic red sauce, and in this case, a very "Roma tomato" fresh tasting sauce. And because I asked about their meat sauces, the waiter brought me a soup bowl filled with the Bolognese sauce, which I liberally put on both their garlic bread and some of my penne pasta. That could've been a meal in itself. Nina's kitchens prove the adage that, "...there's no substitute for quality and freshness!" And she also proved that her affection for great food extends to her affection for her patrons, as she brought us a huge serving of her "in-house" tiramisu. It was such a well balanced dessert; "almost as sweet as Nina!" Enough said.
Fish Market Restaurant=This place is all about the seafood.  Don't roll up to the Fish Market expecting a cool place to hang or a hip crowd.  No problem on the crowd...lots of folks in a pretty basic seafood restaurant, chowing on the best seafood I've had in the valley so far.  The hip is not here.  Not until I showed up with my wife Audrey W to meet Kevin H and Marian H.  You could actually see the coolness spread around the restaurant when we walked in...a subtle ripple, sort of like a gentle wave at a spring training game.So I arrived in Phoenix from Boston and have high standards for seafood.  I had been craving fish & chips for awhile and decided to give Fish Market a try.  I got a combo-fish, scallops and prawns.  The batter was light and not very oily...+1.  The prawns were very tender and done to perfection..+1.  The scallops were tender, sweet and juicy...+1.  The fish was done just right as well although it was not the haddock or even cod I am accustomed to in Boston.Everyone else was pleased with their food as well.  I will be trying other seafood places in the valley but I'll keep Fish Market in mind as a standby.
Fatso's Pizza=Fatso's is great!  It is a small pizza joint, and while it isn't fancy or glamorous by any stretch of the imagination, it is the perfect place to grab some wings, pizza and beer.  We live close by and come to Fatso's often.  There are several things that keep us coming back.  The Gus....so simple, yet so delicious.  The perfectly crusty bread loaded with sharp cheddar, lean roast beef and fresh jalapenos is undeniably one of favorite sandwiches of all time (check it out Nader!).  Their honey barbecue wings are awesome.  The sauce is made in-house and it is remarkable.  Think sweet, smokey barbecue with a spicy kick.  The wings are baked, an added bonus for me.  The thin crust pizza is good, but don't go in expecting a New York Style pie.  Add fresh garlic to your pizza of choice and you will never want to eat a garlic-less pizza again!Fatso's has a surprisingly large selection of beers on tap and a number of bottled craft beers (Stone, Rogue, etc.).  Lastly, treat yourself to a Fat Cookie.  It is100% worth the thousands of crunches you'll need to do to work it off!
Vincent's of Greentree=A work associate and I came here for lunch one day a couple weeks back.  It is super close to the office and I have heard pretty great things about Vincent's of Green Tree from others and of course Double M on the X gives them plenty of raves while backing up his story with "When I wasn't on a diet." We arrived shortly after noon.  The place is small, and it was busy.  There is a small bar but we opted for one of the two open tables left.  We were waited on quickly, a couple waters for each of us, then after perusing the menu we decided to split a pie.  We ordered the Italian SteakFresh Italian steak, green peppers, onions, mushrooms, cheddar, mozzarella, and provolone cheese.  He also ordered a cup of Italian Wedding Soup.  Now I am not the biggest pizza lover.  I like pizza, but typically I am disappointed in one way or another.  So that being said I thought that I would probably think it was pretty typical, however I was definitely wrong.  I can't say this is the best pie I have had locally but it is up there in the top 5.  Even with all the toppings the pizza stood nice and firm.  The crust was delightful and I don't typically like a thicker crust.  I would say their crust is probably traditional, I prefer thin, but this was so light and airy that the texture was about perfect.  I am not sure about the steak they use.  Couldn't tell with the array of toppings if it was more of a steakum type of meat or not, but together it all tasted delightful.    Between the two of us we finished the medium pie no problem.  My only suggestion to people coming here for lunch is it is busy and you will wait.  So if you only have 30 minutes for lunch, I would call ahead, because it took almost 40 minutes from the time of order to get our pie.  Otherwise bon appétit!
Groceria Italiana=7/31 - Move to Bloomfield.8/1 - Go to Groceria Italiana.8/3 - Go to Groceria Italiana.8/4 - Go to Groceria Italiana.8/5 - Go to Groceria Italiana.It's just that damn good. This place is what it would be like if your Italian grandmother opened a grocery store near you, so that you could still enjoy her homemade goodness while you're away. Everything I've had from the hot foods table is phenomenal -- the oft-touted meatball sandwiches, the eggplant parm, the stuffed peppers (brought 'em home to my dad dahn in Washpa, and he said it was THE best stuffed pepper he'd ever had), the chicken cacciatore, the Italian sausage, the rotini with meat sauce, and the pepperoni rolls. OH, the pepperoni rolls! They're big, they're stuffed with quality pepperoni and cheese, they're crispy on the bottom, and have what I consider the determining factor in what makes a pepperoni roll awesome -- tons of burnt cheese crusted on the outside. (Side note: If you want a pepperoni roll and are in Bloomfield, come here; don't go to Pizza Italia.) But, it doesn't stop there. It's easy to walk straight over to the hot foods and ignore the rest of the store, but don't. The freezers are packed with good food glory! Grab a bag of the frozen, homemade gnocchi and a quart of the marinara sauce (kept in the cooler with salads), and you've got an incredible meal in 5 minutes flat. The gnocchi are perfection -- dense, yet light, and the flavor screams, "I'm homemade! Boxed, pre-packaged gnocchi ain't got nothin' on me!" I'm going to buy 4 more bags of them today. They also have frozen, homemade pierogies (haven't tried 'em yet), pastas, sausages, Italian ice, and -- drumroll, please -- tiramisu. There's a sign on the front door that says, "We have the best tiramisu!" and they are not lyin'. It's phenomenal. Because of that, it's also super dangerous stuff. Diet-ruining, can't-stop-eating kinda stuff.They have a nice li'l selection of pantry stuff, too -- quality olive oils, vinegars, anchovies, olives, spices, mayo, etc., as well as a small refrigerated section with milk, and some local produce, like lettuce, cukes, tomatoes, etc. This is definitely a place you can pop into to try and avoid a Giant Eagle run!Last, but not least, something good to know: I asked one of the guys working there if they had certain days of the week designated for certain dishes, and he said, "No, the two ladies just come in early and see what's in the kitchen and make whatever they feel like making that day!" I love that. Somebody's grandma really is making this food, and you can tell it's all made with lots and lots of love. Groceria Italiana, I will be patronizing you for years to come!I visited after work last Fri. to pick up dinner.  I considered getting the raviolis, but decided against it because (1) I already had some frozen raviolis in the freezer (though I'm sure theirs are much better); (2) They're not cheap, at $7ish per box; (3) I wanted a hot take-out dinner.  Since I'd heard good things about the pepperoni rolls but had never tried a pepperoni roll, I asked the guy working behind the counter if they had any.  He confirmed that they did, so I bought one of them plus a tiramisu, which came to about $12.Upon arriving home, I decided to heat up the pepperoni roll in the toaster oven.  It was excellent, with light and fluffy but substantial bread, plenty of pepperoni slices, and a layer of mozzarella cheese.  While I liked the flavor, it occurred to me that some marinara sauce would make it even more flavorful, so I heated up some in the microwave and proceeded to dip the roll in the sauce as I ate it.  (As a newbie to pepperoni rolls, I don't know if this is a common practice.)  Ideally, I should have asked if they had any marinara sauce for dipping, since a higher-quality marinara sauce would have been even better.  Oh, well--I'll do that next time.The tiramisu was even better than the pepperoni roll.  I've had tiramisu a couple of times, but I don't seek it out since I'm not a huge fan of coffee-flavored desserts.  This tiramisu is addictive, however, and the espresso-soaked ladyfingers had me wanting more every time I ate a piece.  Even if you're not a big tiramisu fan, I'd suggest trying their version--it's tiramisu the way tiramisu should taste.Perhaps the most notable thing about this store is that the majority of products appear to be homemade (i.e., non-commercial).  Aside from the items I've already mentioned, they have an assortment of cheeses, pasta, and pizzelles.  I look forward to visiting again and partaking of some more Italian goodness soon!EDIT: I tried the sun dried tomato basil ravioli, and they were absolutely delicious. Just make sure to bake them according to the directions--the reviewer who said they fell apart on him obviously tried to boil them.  Looking forward to trying more delicious flavors of raviolis soon!I have been eyeing up Groceria Italiana for months, but I had to wait for the right moment.  I knew it was going to be an amazing little store, and sometimes I start weeping when I am really happy... which is awkward in a little grocery store.I finally got a box of the Gorgonzola artichoke ravioli.  They weren't cheap, but they were AMAZING.  I want to try all of the flavors.  The inside was rich and delicious, and the noodle was homemade perfection.I really want to try the Tiramisu, but I'm turned off by the fact that it is frozen.  Fresh would be better.The actual store has everything you could ever want: meats, cheese, prepared foods, and specialty Italian items.  There is also a public lot next door, which is convenient.  The employees are helpful as well.  Check it out ASAP.
Ho Ho Cherry House=It's Monday night; I'm hung over, tired, and have been wearing the same two-week disposable contact lenses for so long that the calcium deposits are creating white blind-spots on my periphery. Who do I call? Ho Ho Cherry House. It's Tuesday night; I have a six-pack of PBR in the fridge and four episodes of the CW's break-out hit Arrow to catch up on... Who do I call? Ho Ho Cherry House. It's Wednesday night; I'm supposed to be meeting a coworker for trivia at some dive-bar in Ballantyne, but it's that sort of awkward cold outside where it's too chilly for shorts but not quite cool enough for long pants. Plus, I don't have any clean socks. So I blow it off and call Ho Ho Cherry House. It's Thursday night; my ladyfriend and I have a hundred bucks worth of unassembled Galaxy Squad LEGO kits stacked up on the coffee table and the latest Channing Tatum action flick pirate-bay'd. Who do we call? Ho Ho Cherry House. It's Friday night; I'm supposed to be meeting up with my friends to hang out around a fire pit and drink beer and talk about life, but I'm "feeling kind of sick" or "I'm really busy" or "Really? I didn't get that text". Instead, I'm calling Ho Ho Cherry House. It's Saturday night. AJ and S are coming over to drink gin and play old school Mario with the lady and me. We wanna grub up but AJ and I are unsuccessful in convincing the women to cook us something. So we call Ho Ho Cherry House. It's Sunday evening; the Panthers are playing a late-game at San Francisco. I have a free-pizza coupon from Papa Johns stuck to the front of the fridge. But who do I call? Ho Ho Cherry House. The point is - no matter the day, no matter the situation, the only reasonable answer to your desire for Chinese delivery is Ho Ho Cherry House. Sesame chicken. Shrimp fried rice. Egg foo young. Crab Rangoons. Those gnarly little dumpling things. A bucket of General Tso's. A freakin' boat-load of Lo Mein. A lil Mei Fun to keep things crazy. It's ALL GOOD. Seriously, if you're in their delivery radius (from 7th street), hit this place up. It's very consistently good, the delivery drivers are friendly and professional, and their website has super-convenient online ordering so that you can get through 90% of the experience without having to speak to another human. On those nights where you just wanna stay in, be lazy, and gorge yourself on something cheap, delicious, and oh-so-not-good for you, Ho Ho Cherry House is it. Let me emphasize one thing: The name of this restaurant is HO. HO. CHERRY. HOUSE. An inspiring entrepreneur selected for the name of his or her establishment, Ho Ho Cherry House. This is a real thing that is happening around us that we can all be a part of. No joke. It's Chinese takeout that tastes like Chinese takeout. It's predictably, unspectacularly exactly what it's supposed to be. Very few things in life infuse me with as much pure joy and anticipation as someone uttering the words...Ho. Ho.Cherry.Houuuuuuussssseeeeee.
The World Famous Open Kitchen=This is one of those places you desperately want to love... the decor is amazing, some strange, psychedelic mixture of saloon meets slightly-cheesy italian... the waitstaff are a bunch of sweethearts, mostly old ladies...and it's been here for something like 60 years, pumping out pizzas and pasta and texas toa-er-garlic bread. But you can't really, because its pretty pricey-- and the food is bad. The combination kills it for you. Your pizza comes out, at a whopping $12 for a smallish two topping, and the crust is Elio's, or something, a poured batter-like pie shell texture crust. The sauce is hardly there, and the cheese is so plasticized, it stretches for feet. Your "greek salad" is $6 and is half a head of iceburg with oddly-flavored diced beets, a small sprinkling of feta, two tomato quarters, and two small olives. I've given it two tries, maybe the third will be different... but I get the feeling the recipes and style of cooking happening here haven't changed in 20 years, and are unlikely to in the near future.
Don Jose Mexican Food=The first thing you need to know about Don Jose is that it's closed. It shut down after 40-plus years in December of '07. The second thing you need to know is that Don Jose was the greatest Mexican Food restaurant on God's green earth. Oh, you could quibble with me about our definitions--what constitutes true Mexican food, etc, etc. Don Jose was, by most standards, a dive--a simple, no-frills, insanely inexpensive dining experience in a 60-year old former IHOP. The style of Mexican food they served was what we rare Arizona natives call "Sonoran", but what some others call "gringo"--cheese crisps instead of "quesidillas", hard-shell tacos and tostadas, etc, etc. There were no sprouts or carrots or squid or catfish or organic cage-free okra on the menu; the burritos contained shredded beef or beans, lots of cheese, and they had a side menu of American favorites--burgers, grilled cheese, fries, the works. The interior was decorated on a $10 budget circa 1964 and it stayed that way until they closed the joint; the red rotary phone still hangs behind the huge 1940s cash register. It didn't matter what you ordered. It was all staggeringly good. There was no single item on the menu more than $4. The salsa was a mind-altering trip to an altered dimension where everything was made of delicious. The week they closed, they had lines around the block and wait times pushing three hours. I ate 36 cheese tacos in the space of 12 days. And 12 cheese crisps. And 8 burritos. And 20 bowls of chips. I'm still on the treadmill working it off, my arteries may never recover and I don't care. When they closed I felt like somebody in my family had died. Sadly, the owner decided to retire to spend more time with his family. What am I, chopped liver? I ate there for 25 years! I AM family, dammit!I swiped a menu. Sometimes, late at night, I clutch it to my chest and sob. Maybe I can find a therapist who serves cheese tacos.Your only other alternative for truly spectacular Mexican food in the Phoenix area is La Perla in Glendale--another classic family-owned place that opened in the 40s (and honestly, far more authentic and flavorful--but for me, not quite "home".) Go there at once. Quick, before it's replaced by some horrible strip-mall fresh-Mex garbage.
Lovejoys Kansas City Bar-B-Q=Do you love big sloppy pieces of pork fat covered in barbecue sauce? If so please come here!!I'll be as nice as I can since I've only been here once and only had one item.   I had open faced pork sandwich with a side of coleslaw.   The pork was sliced thin but was 50% fat. and no, not just one piece of pork but the entire plate of it, yuck!They must have forgot to add the dressing to the coleslaw because it was bone dry.  Yummy, I love raw plain cabbage! How did they know?I'll give them the benefit of the doubt and say I just got a bad hunk of meat because there is no way this place could serve food like that and stay in business.  If they change their name to "My Big Plate of Pork Fat with Sauce" it would better suit the meal I was served.---Re-reading my own review and now I'm pissed that I didn't send it back, I should have damn it!Now I'm not from Kansas City but I started eating meat again awhile ago and I'm pretty picky about what kind of meat I put in my mouth believe it or not! I havent had a pork sandwich in a few years and I usually hate teh pork!! The way this was cooked, seriously it was not fatty or I never would have polished the whole thing off. I liked it that much! I have no qualms with throwing shitty food in the garbage where it belongs. The taste was really good with just the right smokey flavor the meat was tender and not dry. I was so full I didnt even touch my sides so I cant say anything about the fries, onion rings, or slaw. It was a bit pricey but this totally hit the spot for me the other night....that is all!There's a huge banner out front proclaiming :" UNDER NEW MANAGEMENTTHE OLD OWNERS ARE BACK", but I didn't ask "for how long?", so can't say how that pertains to the less than stellar reviews showing up here.I got solid 4 star food and service.I definitely recommend choosing "Burnt Ends" as your meat!It is a mix of pork and beef brisket, but cut into hunks instead of shredded.  It's not burnt as the clever name implies, but the chunks give you plenty of crusty "BARK" full of smoky flavor.   My usual habit of mixing the sweet and hot sauces being offered worked out perfectly.The amount of fat in the meat was absolutely appropriate, unlike other reviewers have said.  It's needed for flavor, tenderness, and juiciness, which my sammich had all three of.If I went for BBQ and got 100% lean meat, I'd complain!!!!On a bizarre note, their fries were the exact taste and consistency of McDonald's fries!  Maybe a good thing to some people, maybe even great to some, but if they're not going to be the thick homecut wedges I'd prefer, then I'd say they should aim more for Wendy's fries 8^ )Service was great.  The decor was clean and full of stylized jazz musician paintings and sculptures.My only gripe is that I hate menus with rules, and this one was interspersed with the classic "No Substitutions" for the lunch special, and a few others.  No biggie, i understand they need to try to control some costs, and i'll be back regardless.Old owners are back and by that I mean the original owners from back when they occupied the Chino's building. Lunch here with Ryan C proved to be most excellent. I had the pulled pork large size not the smaller lunch size. They serve it with frys and pickle slices. The sesame studded bun was large enough and dense enough to hold in the mound of meaty goodness. No fat in this one folks. The frys were forgettable and the pickles had bite. The sauce I used was the spicy and it was perfect. More of a KS style, ketchup based sauce. The service was attentive but slow as they had a server call in sick. I would rather have slow service then a sick server any day. The guy next to us said he drives from Sun City just to eat here. That means he passes El Paso, Thee Pits, Shanes RibShack Just to get here. I tried a bite of the burnt ends... I love it. More like a tougher chunk not a pulled type but man there was a ton of flavor. I burped the smoke at dinner. YEAAHH!! Price was good, place was clean and people seemed happy.
The Melting Pot=If liking Melting Pot is wrong, I don't want to be right. Listen, I know Melting Pot is a chain and it's pricey...waahhhh wahhh. Guess what? I love melty cheese. I love melty chocolate. I don't *mind* throwing a few veggies into a crockpot of chicken broth and hanging out for a little while. Plus, they have a decent drink list and great variety of offerings & meal combinations. The service at this particular Melting Pot is typically solid and they are great at handling substitutions. Don't like broccoli? They'll sub out for another veggie. Scallops get you down? Sub in some bird. Oh, and I haven't mentioned it yet, but the Green Goddess cream cheese/sour cream/herby sauce for the veggies is so good I want to marry it.Whether you want just a cheese fondue or you're going full on three course, Melting Pot is solid & delicious.I wish that I could give The Melting Pot more than 5 stars because they made our company holiday party stress free and absolutely perfect!!I have put together a number of company parties and they are always stressful and something horrific normally goes on. Tracy (rest manager) made the entire process a breeze, from start to finish. She even let me taste test the wines we were serving. That was a fun afternoon ;-)The food was amazing, as usual, and the service was outstanding. I would highly recommend the spinach artichoke cheese fondue and the yin and yang chocolate fondue! Amazing!!!!I would highly recommend The Melting Pot to anyone looking to host a holiday party or really any type of party for that matter. It is also a really intimate and romantic place to take someone on a date.
Rimrock Bar & Grille=Along with Karri, I would give them 2.5 stars if I could.I had a business lunch here the other day.  Time was limited and it made sense to grab lunch at the Hilton where several of the parties were staying. I played it safe with a chicken quesadilla.  It was better than average for about 10 bucks.  It came with generous sides of guacamole and sour cream.The service was good.  Prompt and efficient without being obtrusive.  Rimrock Bar & Grille is not a place I would ever seek out but safe and decent food for a hotel restaurant.
Rusty's Deli & Grille=Per dollar, your not going to find any better food close by.  I'm not saying literally "Woohoo! As good as it gets!"  But, on that side of town I don't know of any other place you can get full and have a beer for under $10.It is a Deli/Grille with beer.  Pretty straight forward.  You grab your drink while waiting in line to place an order, then you order at the counter.  You walk around the side to pay and they give you a number.  Put that number on your table, and your food will be delivered shortly.  No wait service, just fast service.  I prefer eating out on the patio if there is space available.There is quite a variety of choices.  From burgers to french dips.  Bratwurst to meatball subs.  Salads, stuffed potatoes, and even some vegetarian options.  I've tried it all and never had a bad meal.I know this review sounds more like an ad for the place, but I really have nothing bad to say.  Its a chill little spot that puts out great food at a reasonable price.  Kind of unheard of on park rd.
Sonic Drive-In=Pull up to your spot, order your food, and it is brought out to your car. All the while 50's - classic rock tunes are playing over the speaker system. As far as fast food chains go this is one of the better ones. Nothing like feeling a touch of nostalgia of a drive-in joint where you can sit in your car with the windows open in beautiful weather and have the food brought to you. Happy hour from 2-4 where all the drinks are half price! Can't beat a Big Gulp sized Grape Slushie and Blue Coconut Slushie for only $1 each! Along with some tastily seasoned popcorn chicken, a ranch chicken wrap, and perfectly crispy tater tots this was a winning quick lunch!Yum - tater tots!Seems so seemless here. Pull up, press the red button, place your order, and within minutes it is brought to your car with a smile. If you want to eat outside there are some tables and chairs on a small patio in the front. How can anyone not like this?Grape slushie....Mmmmmm.I can't imagine making it through a hot summer without my Route 44 Diet Cherry Limeades to keep me cool, so I'm a frequent visitor to the Sonic Drive-In back home.  While visiting Phoenix over the July 4th week, this Sonic, on the North side of E. McDowell between N. 48th and N. 51st, became my go-to drink restaurant of choice.What is unique about this particular Sonic is that there is a drive through, but no drive through window.  Feel free to ponder this for a moment or two.  There is a menu and a speaker where you can order whatever you like, and then you pull forward to... a solid wall on the side of the building.  No window to hand them your cash, and - most distressing of all - no window where they can hand me my humongous frosty beverage.  Well, okay, I did eventually receive my beverage as one of their servers walked out the front door and handed it to me where I tentatively pulled up to the edge of the curb.  Now, I know what you're thinking - Sonic is basically a drive up restaurant where they park and bring your food TO YOU, so why would I insist on driving through?  None of your beeswax, buster, I just do.  In addition to driving up and parking to order, there are plenty of outdoor tables, most with shade, where you can also sit, order, and enjoy your food or beverages.So, do whatever your little heart desires: park and sit in your car, park and sit at the tables, or order at the drive through and act really confused when you can't find the drive through window.  Just make sure you try the cherry limeade - trust me on this one.
NYPD Pizza=My daughter and I sort of stumbled on this place a couple of weeks ago.  We were at the Ulta just around the corner and she said she was hungry and she LOVES pizza.  We have been here twice as of this writing.  The second time around was "Kids Eat Free" night.  That is Wednesay for those of you with kids and it's a good deal.  I will eventually put together a list of Kids Eat Free places in the area.  For now let me tell you about NYPD.....The pizza is a winner!  Nice crust, great topppings!  They use paper thin slices of sausage instead of hunks of sausage.  The flavore is great too.  My daughter had a slice of black olive pizza and they were very generous with the olives....she loved it!  I have had the ceaser and the house salads and both were good and fresh.  So for the Kids Eat Free night adults need to order an entree (I think this includes a whole pizza too, not sure though) There were several things to choose from including cheese ravioli, baked ziti, and  lasagne.  I chose the lasagne and it was delish!  Piping hot with melted mozeralla over the top, I could not stop eating it!!  The flavors melded together nicely and it reminded me of my Mom's lasagne.  And did I mention the bread......OMG!!  The little ibites of heaven are sooooo good!!  I could have eaten ten of them!!  They are homemade, the real deal, yeasty goodness!!  Warm and just a little chewy, the flavor was amazing!!  Oh and the Desert Flower Ice Tea.....so refreshing!!!  I keep thinking about it, that's how good it is!!Try the canollis.....you won't be disappointned.  Kids get an ice cream sundae with their meal.  On our first visit Lori, our server, was a real sweetheart.  She gave me some coupons and signed me up for the email list.  And on our next visit , Jessica was awesome and attentive too!This is a small place but they also have an outdoor patio with misters.  The bar is tiny, probably seats 10.  Flat screen for watching the D'backs and some good beers on tap, along with Happy Hour specials makes this a great place!!  This will be somewhere we will frequent!!  Thanks NYPD!!!First time everrrrrr that I wish yelp had a half star. The pizza is great. The wings are good. The service is awful. That combination = 3.5 stars.I was in the area and wanted to try more places that served wings after my awesome luck at Long Wong's. NYPD has an "express lunch" area which has a different menu than the normal dine-in menu. I went with a sicilian slice (already cooked and on display) and 6 wings. There was only one other table (2 people) in the lobby, so I figured I'd get my food within a reasonable amount of time.  I waited over 30 minutes to get that very simple dish... and it came with one celery stick. I asked for more celery, so the waitress brought out two celery sticks... really?I would eat here again, but only through delivery.
China Chili=Wow, so this is the mecca of Chinese food in Phoenix? I mean don't get me wrong, I had some enjoyable items, but this is the Macayo's of Chinese restaurants. Undaring dishes with expected flavors delivered witha reasonable price. Now, mind you there is a hell-a-handsome tattooed waiter, who while I'm waiting for my to go food, I do the blue steel, eye lash flicker while I'm puckering up my lips look. While I'm sure I think I look hot and flirty, he and the rest of the staff are hurling up the mid afternoon dim sum. I'm just saying so often the famous favorite that's been around forever can be stale and uninventive. But on a Sunday, the pork lo mein, crab puffs and broccoli and beef nicely soak up the cosmo overdose I suffered at the hands of the previous night bartender who overserved me. The nerve. Chow Mein yelpers!Uh, 10 minutes to cook up egg flower soup, house chicken, and honey walnut prawns?  Serious?!  I don't think I'd want to sit down and eat there; it seemed a little depressing, way too warehouse-like (and crappy warehouse-like, not a good warehouse-like).Food?  Not bad ... the walnut prawn dish was great, huge prawns.  House chicken, not so great.  And the egg flower soup was pretty good, but nothing special.  Overall, pretty much your standard chinese joint, and standard chinese joints are awesome, so I'll definitely go back ... did I mention the walnut shrimp was awesome?Thank you David and Lisa S for introducing us to China Chli this past Friday night!We're always on the lookout for good Chinese in the Valley, and now we have another option (not too far from home) with China Chili.  I didn't expect CC to be such a large restaurant, and they were hopping to boot!  The atmosphere was welcoming - casual and old school; I especially love the disco ball in the main dining room.  The servers are serious and efficient, perhaps because they don't speak much English, but with so many customers, it works out fine... I imagine most people are there for the food anyways.So without further adieu, here's what we ordered for our family-style dinner:-Pot Stickers (I didn't have these but everyone else did and enjoyed them!)-Sizzling Rice Soup-Honey Walnut Prawns-Sichuan Style String Beans (we ordered with no pork and extra spicy thanks to a tip I found in Julie P's yelp review)-House Chow Fun Noodles-One of their house special steak dishes (I think it was Sizzling Black Pepper Beef in a dark sauce).Yes, I know, that's a lot of food for four people but we did have plenty of leftovers and I liked everything that I ate!Thank you -  (Xièxiè) - China Chili, David and Lisa, for a memorable meal!  I look forward to returning soon to try some of my other Chinese favorites!This is an excellent restaurant with very tasty unique dishes. Why am I giving it 5 stars? My mom said that she really enjoyed her meal, and was the best Asian dinner she's ever had. I was glad to hear that because I liked my food too! Although this restaurant is called China Chili, it takes its inspiration from Singapore and Malaysian influences. The egg rolls were even different. I was pleased to see that they use rice wrapper instead of the thick flour kind that most Chinese restaurant use. I don't really like those because they are too thick! Also, being a vegetarian, I was also very impressed with the vegetable selection here. My roommate ordered the Ma Po Tofu. I ordered the Tofu with green string beans, and my mom ordered the cashew chicken. The dishes were prepared to a high standard and served in good-sized portions. The service here was quick and friendly, and the prices were very reasonable. Will be back again. :-)The orange chicken is great. This place is always packed.I went here for my friend's graduation dinner.  We were served the traditional and authentic 10-course banquet-style dinner.  I didn't even know this place existed until that night!  The food is pure Hong Kong style cooking without the unnecessary frills --- just the way I like it!  The food comes hot and fresh and the wait stuff is friendly.  I can't remember every single dish that was served as it was an extremely festive night with lots of loud talking and cheers but I do recall the roasted duck and steamed fish in soy sauce with ginger and onions being amongst my favorite.  Come for the delicious food and not the atmosphere because this place isn't that cute.  ;DBomb!! Bomb orange chicken... Not like weirdMc nuggets covered in sauce. We order it extra spicy Szechuan beef so soBomb egg rolls Bomb pot stickers Bomb spicy mustard
Hooters=I'm pissed. How can you just stop making grilled cheese? Its bread and cheese. HOW? You have bread, and you have cheese, but you cannot make a grilled cheese?Also, why does it have to be 400 degrees? I know you have A.C. This is AZ in the summer. It's hot. Turn it on.I don't have a really good basis to draw this conclusion because I rarely order this drink, but your dirty vodka martini is quite possibly the worst I have ever tasted. I had to eat a cheese stick with each bite just to stomach it.Your tater tots were good and my blue moon was reasonably priced. At least you have that going for you.This Hooters definitely improved after the remodeling, and it is a good place for simple to grab a sandwich, beer. and/or wings served by hotties in bikinis while watching a game on the multiple TVs.  I know that Hooters is supposed be famous for its wings as well as its female servers with big boobs, but I've never been very impressed with the wings.  The boobs on the other hand.... well, you know! HOOTY-WHO! ;-)I love Hooter's!!!!No, no, not the restaurant...it's really not the best dining experience, from a "good food" perspective. Mr. Hooter founded his establishment (Hooter's) on the premise that a few chickens losing their wings so that we can happily dine on them and wash them down with beer is a good thing:)It probably is a good thing (chickens don't really need their wings...even the free range clucker's can't fly:), things are just not particularly well executed at Hooters. Maybe it's the boobs who bought the place from Mr. Hooter that aren't living up to expectations.Still, the patrons were at Hooter's in force yesterday afternoon.What keeps them coming in droves?There must be something that keeps the clients (erstwhile diners?) coming in...could it be the charitable causes (I surmised that it's something about saving owls) that Mr. Hooter supported? I understand that Hooter's is all about support!Maybe it's the extraordinarily loud, yet incomprehensible music coming from the mis-synchronized speakers dotting the ceiling of Hooter's. I did notice that servers (all of whom seem to be young ladies in the full bloom of young lady-hood) all seem to kind of "groove" to the music, so they must like it:)Maybe it's the comforting bosom of Hooter's "sports bar" décor (funny signs, racks and racks of sports memorabilia, posters, etc., on the walls) that the Hooters client base yearns for. Nice artwork!Hard to say. I did notice that most of the diners were male, mid 30's to 60's and just sort of stared, glassy eyed (at the servers, not the food). That may help explain things.The Beautiful Carin called, out of the blue, and asked me out for lunch today:)What a nice surprise for me:)It was a perfect day for lunch, because I was ready to get out of the office for a while and see my girl.She suggested Hooter's (yeah, that's right...it wasn't me! :) We hadn't been to one for years, so we gave it a try. She had a Cobb Salad with Chicken Breasts and I had a Chicken Breast Sandwich with a side of fried pickles (I have a Norwegian heritage...we never saw a vegetable or fruit that we didn't want to fry, boil, bake or distill:)It's funny that we both ordered something with Breasts...must have been "in the air".It wasn't horrible, but it wasn't really good...mediocre, pedestrian, ordinary are words that come to mind. Even the pickles, which I had been wanting for a while.However, inexpensive is not a word that comes to mind...$36 for salad, sandwich, pickles and iced tea!I think we must be paying for ambiance. I Love Hooter's!!!!!No, not the restaurant:)
Tee Pee Tap Room=Tee Pee has been a family favorite of ours for 20+ years. It tends to be our meet-up spot on the weekends to sit at the bar, watch sports, and enjoy some authentic Mexican food! My dad and I love meeting up here for some quality father/daughter time! It has a dive-bar, cozy feel (which I love)! The service is always great and the food is always satisfying. I AM a creature of habit and always order the Albondigas soup (Mexican meatball soup) + rice inside and a small cheese crisp with green chilis and guacamole! Their house-made chips, hot sauce, and salsa are the bomb.com. I have been known to eat a whole bowl of chips and salsa to myself. Shh, don't tell. ;) If you're looking for a neighborhood favorite, authentic Mexican food joint, this is your place.
California Pizza Kitchen=CPK. Creative. Pizzas. Kinda.When I think of the early 90s. I think of CPK. Of course I also think of Joey Lawrence on Blossom. But who doesn't, really? And new Coke. And we all know how that worked out. But CPK was innovative at the time. California cooking was all the rage thanks to Mr. Puck. The BBQ Chicken Pizza won over droves of pizza fans. Quickly, the Thai pizza caught on and CPK became quickly initialized in American culture like KFC, PTA and FYI. This location serves up the fare like all the others. Not much panache but dependable. Much like the Chevrolet Malibu. Could they use a bit of a makeover? Sure. But the Price Is Right set got one and no one's loving that. So why bother.
Hong Kong Gourmet Buffet=When Hoa called and said we were having a reunion of former branch employees at a Chinese buffet, I wasn't at all apprehensive. My normal concerns with such eateries--will the food be maintained at a proper food-safe temperature, is this seafood fresh, how long has the sushi been sitting out, will I be able to make it home before my intestines rupture--dissipated because Hoa knows good Asian cuisine. She is, of course, born to Vietnam and world traveled. Let's start with my happiest aspect about HKGB: the sushi. No, it's not the best sushi in the Valley, but they make it fresh for you on site. You can stand there and watch it being make, grab a soup or something else to munch on, or just sit at your table and chat awhile. Afterwards, you can head back for more sushi or veer over to the more traditional offerings of a Chinese buffet: sweet and sour chicken, fried rice, crab legs. Now let's review the not-so-shiny aspect: the price. Yes, it seems a little steep that we paid about $25 per person with tip (and I made only two rounds) but when you factor in the 2 hours we spent there, grazing, catching up, grazing, passing Lisette's daughter around, grazing and making plans to keep in touch, it's really not such an outrageous amount to pay. If you find yourself in this part of town, craving Chinese and are wicked crazy hungry, give HKGB a shot.Noticed that some yelpers don't really write reviews thats more than 1 paragraph or so... hopefully no one thinks I'm crazy for writing essay-like reviews on each one of the location that I've been to.  One paragraph is simply not enough room for me to describe a restaurant.With that said.. I totally forgot that on my Southwest tour I also visited a buffet while I'm in Phoenix...(Peter C. really enjoys my buffet reviews so I'm gonna make sure that I review each and every buffet I go to! Just for you Peter!!!)So it's about 8:15pm and we just arrived into Phoenix from Sedona after a 12 hr road trip...  I wanted something to eat but knowing that simple burger was not gonna do it.  So to treat my buddy I've decided to find a high reviewed buffets to indulge on!  (Thanks yelpers!)The place closes at 9:00pm so we had to work quick...  It's a typical chinese style buffet that you can find in LA dime a dozen ($14.99 for dinner which is little higher than the buffets here in LA)... The location was very clean, the dining time we went was completely empty....(maybe that made it look cleaner?)  There were 4 stations with about 6-8 hot trays with your typical food fares such as orange chicken, beef with brocolli, lemon salmon, fried wonton, crab rangoon, bbq ribs, prime rib, mayonaise covered mussels, simply steamed clams, string beans, fried noodles, fried rice, fruit salad, salad bar, and a very small selection of sushi bar that had like 3 types of sushi there...(Mongolian BBQ dude was on break or something....Not Available!)Overall the taste was half decent or was it because we were so hungry and that we had to finish up our meal fast because we still got another hour to go on the road?  Whatever it was the salmon was delicious and the ribs actually tasted really good.  Friend got the noodles with orange chicken, beef brocolli and thought idelicious as well....  I know for a fact that these chinese style buffets can't get any better or worse  (Unless you are Bamboo Garden then there is a great chance you can screw this up!), so as long as the food is not overly salty and has a respectable service, the experience should all be about the same...( I often wonder if all these chinese buffet chefs came out of a same buffet culinary school?  There's gotta be a hidden buffet university catering just to aspiring chinese buffet chefs!!!!  Seriously, how does buffet in CA taste the same as those in AZ?  or in face WA, OR, etc.?  )I'm guessing we were just really really hungry that is why it was so good.....Insanely 4 stars reviewed based on this one time visit....  hopefully I'm not too off.....  Good service though!  (It took us 20 minutes to be in & out of that place!  Call us The Flash of Meals!!!!!)
Rito's Market & Mexican Take Out=I've frequented Rito's since the late 80's, way before it was cool to drive down through the Garfield neighborhood. One of the only positive things about working in the financial services industry is that no one seems to care if you take a 2 hour lunch in order to make your way in to "the hood" for some really good food.Lunch crowds are a mix of locals and lawyers, lined up shoulder to shoulder in a line that usually makes it way out the door. Take a dose of patience and a big appetite (oh and cash.... no plastic here).My favorite: the red mix burro enchilada style.... just typing that phrase makes my jaw shudder hannibal lecter style.This is another one of my absolute favorites in AZ. I've heard some folks pan on other boards but I just flat out don't get it. For people visiting AZ, this is a must go imo. My relatives visiting from Australia requested it as their last meal on their way out of town.First of all, I'm not a big green chili fan. Second of all, Rito's green chile burro is one of my top 3 bites in all of AZ.Tortillas are amazing (homemade), beans are amazing (I guess I'm still a big fan of lard). Unbelievably, beans seem to get even better when you microwave them from the fridge the next day too.I love the character of the place. It's run by a mother, her daughters & some other relatives. They do what they do & are who they are & don't really care beyond that. I've heard it compared to the Soup Nazi from the Seinfeld episode. My first visit, I did get that vibe but the ladies have been super sweet many, many times. It is a bit tough to find, they have short hours, they only take cash and as the sign says, do NOT approach the window on your cell phone.  I think at present they quit making tacos because they were too much work & the mom has had some health issues. So basically you get what you get. I say get the green chile burro.So they are who they are & do what they do, take it or leave it. I love it.As far as the shop, it's basically just a barred window counter you order from, you pick up your food & go outside & eat on picnic-like tables. They are open only M-F from 9 - 5ish. Close even a bit earlier on Fridays I think. They're on 14th street just south of Roosevelt right across from the school. You'll just see a screen door & that's it. If it's around lunch time, you'll probably see a line as well.I think the short hours & no evenings, no weekends even add to the obsession for me. Scarcity makes it even more desired.Right now, I cannot believe how much I'm craving this food.BTW, the warning about scalding food & soupy burrito are right on. Ended up with a bunch of scalding green chili in my lap my first visit.I've gotta go with A-OK on this one. Not quite ready to commit to being "a fan," yet. To me, being "a fan" would mean I would be willing to drive from North Central Phoenix all the way downtown, devil-may-care style on a work day, to wait in line and put up with the slamming of the metal door every time a customer's lunch order was fulfilled. (That's not a complaint, mind you. It was cool. All part of the charm.)You see, dinner is not an option. They're only open until 4. That said, I obeyed Robert M.'s instructions and ordered a green chile burrito, enchilada style with a side of beans. The beans were runny but good for dipping my bites of burrito. The sauce that made it  "enchilada style" had a good heat. I was pleased. It was "A-OK." I'd go back. Just probably not devil-may-care on a work day.I'm not gonna lie, this was pretty amazing Mexican food. Thank you Yelp. We would have never ever ever have found this place otherwise. They are located in a neighborhood and as of the time we paid a visit, they did not have a sign. It is a brick building that probably used to be a house, and we had to drive past it a couple times to realize we were there. They have a very simple menu, but I am not surprised they have found success with their amazing quality. We shared a enchilada style green chili burrito with beans on the side. WOW. It had cubed pork in it, but I was in love before I even hit any meat. The flavors are so delicious and all of the sauces together were perfect. The beans were super yummy and tasted very fresh and flavorful. We ordered a shredded beef taco that was a special for the day just in case the burrito wasn't going to be enough for the both of us, but it ended up just stuffing us until we couldn't breath. That taco was really good too! It seemed like they freshly fried the taco shell and they were very generous with the beef! Next time we will definitely be satisfied with just the enchilada style burrito to share since it was mighty large. Can't wait to come back for more!!
Joey's California Bistro=Set out to find some dinner with the fam at 8pm Monday night this place is basically across the street from me now. I thought, well this place has been here for years I've never tried it but there must be something good about it.......right!?!? I thought to myself eh WTH! After arguing with my munchkin to get out of the car for 10 mins because she wanted McDonalds instead (it was in her little 6 yr old view from the car) I finally lured her out with her DsLite! YAY So we walk in and were going to be seated in the dining room but we figured its 8pm the last quarter of the Indi & Miami game was on and the place was pretty empty after a quick glance around. We decided to sit in front of the big screen in the bar area! We made the right choice they have Italian soccer jersey's decorating the bar area and I felt very Italian by the end of the night. The server was excellent I repeat EXCELLENT with a capital E. Sorry I am no good with names and forgot his name but he was a tall Italian with some killer eyes complete with full accent!Peroni on tap you say!?!?! Score!! We started with some fried mozzarella it was DELICIOUS the marinara was fresh really chunky and tomato-y! The munchkin loved it and they even gave her Sprite in a cocktail glass. Who care's you say??? Well she will remember this for ages she even talked about it at home hours later. "Mom that was the fanciest glass I've ever had!" This place made her forget about McD's which I give 2 stars for entirely!! The bread was nice, it was toasted which the munchkin loved, she said she loves it toasted where its nice and crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside mmmm! Her words not mine. Ultimately the kid felt really comfy at this place where she is usually really shy and non speaking. The only thing with the bread was instead of olive oil they brought out packaged whipped butter which wasn't bad and I probably could have asked for some oil but I'm not really complaining here so fugetaboutit kwim!The specials that were not on the menu sounded fantastic so we went with them!! After the past weekend and watching Anthony Bourdain in Southeast Asia eating clams I had to have the fresh linguine and clams w/ white sauce. It was DELICOUS!! They will pretty much make any order the way you want it white or red sauce etc. I for one appreciate that aspect. The man had the pork chop stuffed with prosciutto and mozzarella with a tasty marsala wine sauce and mushrooms mmmm he only gave up one bite for me but it was choice!We passed up on dessert but not without the waiter bringing us some shots of their in house homemade limoncello!! OMG just ask how they make it and for some sugar on the rim if you like that sort of thing it was awesome!! That totally topped my night!! I cant wait to go back and try the eggplant parm next! My mouth is watering just thinking about it. Ciao Bello/Bella's!!Holy shit.Where do I begin? First off, "Joey's California Bistro Italian Restaurant"? Isn't that like, "Mandy's Apparel Shop Store for Clothes"?The place was mostly empty, save for terrible, dated decor and a smattering of rather lively and vivacious flies. A waiter was screaming at a customer from the other side of the restaurant. Even when I realized they were screaming sports-oriented things, it still wasn't normal. As our waiter wheezed the specials of the day to us, we feared he was literally about to die in the middle of the word "stuffed".Our salads consisted of romaine, three pieces of cucumber, and one tomato, cut in half. The bleu cheese dressing contained no actual cheese. I ordered tea with lemon and honey, but the honey was a "blend" made out of mostly high fructose rice syrup... is honey too rare a commodity to hunt down these days? Our dinner companion ordered lobster ravioli with shrimp. The waiter brought the lobster ravioli out, then the shrimp, separately, in a little cup. Oh, and the shrimp was BOILED. What is this, 1965? What the actual f*#&.It'd be one thing if this place was dirt cheap, but entrees hit well over $20.Do yourself a favor. Rather than coming here, just eat the money. Even if it's in coins.
Sakana Sushi & Grill=I don't understand how this rates so high. As other reviewers have said, this is not good sushi. It's edible (thus the 2 star rating), but it's not great. I have been to this restaurant 3 times to make sure I wasn't missing anything, and each time I've been only mildly satisfied. They do not serve real crab, their rolls fall apart, and the service is not that great. Maybe I'm going at the wrong time? I have been there during lunch time each time I've gone and have not been impressed at all. On the 3rd try, my friend and I decided that we would not be returning any more.I could've sworn I've written and updated reviews of this place.  Where did they go?  Sakana is my favorite sushi restaurant.  If it weren't for the fact that I've developed allergies to rice and most white fish and certain shellfish (I pretty much stick to wild fish now, and you know how rare it is to find, and how expensive it can get!), I'd eat sushi and sashimi everyday!  (Well, OK, every OTHER day, for I also can eat THAI FOOD everyday!)Lunch combos are great!  In taste and in price.  We would always order the baked mussels.  Loved the spider and crunch eel rolls.  I honestly can't remember disliking anything we've tried here.  It's been awhile since I last visited, so I may update my review soon!Found a new lunch spot oh yea! Went with some coworkers on a Friday at high noon, guess what yall the place was packed, but we waited about 5 mins and then got seated. Right when you walk in you can see on the counter what the lunch specials are, and I knew before I was seated what I wanted! I ordered the Sakana lunch special which was delish! It had rolls, jalapeno stuff crab popper things, tuna, salmon and other fish, came with soup & salad and was 10 bucks!! TEN BUCKS YALL!!! OMG it was delish! I know normally I would not be able to get all that for ten bucks!  Sushi was fresh and great tasting, service was kinda slow, but it was a very busy Friday lunch rush! I am glad to have found them and to add them to my many lunch spots stops! I will be back!I am almost wanting to go and un-star places I have been before, because they pale in comparison to this place.We got 4 orders of nigiri: Salmon, more salmon, tuna, and Salmon roe -- all of them were amazing. We also got a spicy tuna roll which was fresh and delicious, and eel roll which was tangy and delightful.The sushi was SO FRESH, I couldn't believe it. The nigiri was powerful in it's simplicity, and the rolls were incredibly well constructed and  beautifully presented. On top of that, the wait staff here really has their shit together -- like WHOA. Nobody missed a beat, everyone was helpful, and the sushi chef's were chopping and going through order tickets like wildfire, smiling the entire time. Some guy even bought them 4 bottles of sake for their great effort, and I know it was well deserved.Amazing service. Even better sushi.$22 dollars. AAAAAH! I will eat here every day for the rest of my life!!!
Alice Cooper'stown=Just like its namesake, this spot is loud, wild and crazy. If you come here before or after a sporting event, it's sure to be jam packed from floor to ceiling. I've seen every type of person here from the out of towner older gentlemen entertaining .... younger ladies.... to families taking down the super gigantic hot dog that Adam Richmond dominated on Man Vs Food to college student drinking the entire bar up before the game. It's a fun atmosphere, the food is generic bar food with the exception of some ginormous food options and overall just an exciting and enthusiastic crowd and seen. This is definitely a spot to keep on the list if you're in Downtown looking for a fun spot to stop into before or after a game.ROCK OUT WITH YOUR COCK OUT!!!As a big heavy metal and hard rock fan I just had to make sure to hit up Alice Cooperstown on my recent visit to Phoenix. As I walked into this warehouse sized rock & sports mecca I was surely not disappointed.This place is huge. There is an outdoor beer garden seating area on the side of the building and when you walk indoors you realize that this place is airplane hanger big. Rock and roll memorabilia is plastered everywhere here with a terriic amount of Alice Cooper posters, gold and platinum records, photos, paintings, guitars, and other stuff representing his Hall of Fame career plastered throughout. Even all the tables are covered in rock photos and images. Along side all of that is a mix of sports memorabilia spread throughout with flat screen tv's and large projection screens everywhere! Yeah, as you can imagine, they play some great rock music here, classic to current. This is the type of place that Hard Rock Cafe wishes it could be.The menu here is pretty big with a mix of classic bar food, comfort food, and BBQ. Nice selection of beers on tap and in bottles. We ordered a mixed BBQ platter and it was actually some pretty decent BBQ! Great ribs and tasty brisket. Alas, what caught my eye was The Big Unit. Not just a regular hot dog, but 22 inches of Vienna Beef destruction loaded with chili, onions, jalapenos, sauerkraut, relish, tomatoes, cheese sauce, shredded cheddar, and bacon, along with a bunch of crispy fries. Oh Yeah! This is the dog that Adam Richman devoured on Man vs Food! They ring a big bell whenever this is ordered. I saw a few people give up on it and take half home in a box. Not me. Now I was going to join that fat ass and do some damage here myself!Yup, I ate that whole damn thing! Honesty, it was pretty tasty and was not too hard to finish. Just had to pace myself. Drinking a huge cup of diet Coke while doing this was not too smart as my gut felt like it was going to explode! Still, I got the whole thing down my throat bit by bit and swallowed it whole. Heh-heh-heh! I sat there in euphoric bliss of my accomplishment. Boy, did I feel like a fat slob.On the way out we had to look around the souvenier area and picked up a few things. Had a great time here and the food was pretty good. Nice waitress and all of them here wear Alice Cooper-like eye makeup while working which adds to the fun. Menu items are fairly priced too. This part of town is empty unless a game is going on and there is a parking garage across the street, along with metered spots on the streets but after 8PM they are free. Lots of available parking.MAN vs FOOD AIN'T GOT NOTHING ON ME!!!Cold beer good food good music and a cool staff ill defiantly come back!I have been lucky to get really good service at most locations I dine at...That's why people call me Lucky (they don't). So when I get bad service, a generally OK experience becomes anything but OK. Lets buy a ticket and check out Alice Cooper'stown.~Fud/Drink~General....bar....fare. That makes it really simple for everyone. Now they have some interesting food options, yes, but there is nothing special. Why elaborate further? Alice's joint only offers greasy fried food options, with little time put into the preparing of said items.  For a football event I went to, they were offering breakfast. I ordered a cheese/egg quesadilla which was "edible". Filled with grease, I had second thoughts after ordering it, but was hungry. Meh. Of the two stand out items on their menu, the 22 inch hotdog named "The Big Unit" is a big hit. Its big, yes....but that's where it ends. You pay $17+ for a big hotdog guys...its really nothing much to write home about. Why pay that?? If going to the Dbacks game, why not get one or two $1 dogs at Chase? Just saying... I must say the other item on the menu that stood out was the catcher's mitt brownie. For $4.99 you get a HUGE warm brownie plus a scoop of ice cream, everyone at the table was impressed. As for drinks, they really are just overpriced. I know they have rent, I get it. But seriously, $6.50 for a draft that isn't close to a pint? Horrible pricing decision. I would've had an extra beer but this turned me off immediately. Nothing else to say, just too expensive for what you are getting!~Atmosphere/Service~Atmosphere is OK, it could be so much better. The inside is fun on the surface, and they have some cool memorabilia hanging up..it is nice to see what Alice put out for us to view. But overall the bar is there for large groups to gather and talk, no extra fluff. When each Big Unit comes out, an obnoxiously loud ringing bell sounds and the bar staff yells out a chant. After a good 30+ rings, I was saved by the bell when my football game ended. As for service, we were the first table to be sat, and had anywhere between 3-8 people at given times. Service was consistently slow, despite the fact the bar was at about 1/2 capacity for most of the day. I had to flag down our waitress a couple times to get service, and remember that brownie I talked about earlier? Well, it sat on our table for 2 hours after being finished. It was still on the table when I had began leaving. So, service was bad. Really hitting the nail on the head, there was no reason why we shouldn't have been waited on more, especially since we had the largest group in the joint that day. Poor service..meh.~Extras/Rating~Overall, its not the best option for grabbing a drink and bite before games downtown. I have made suggestions for other locations, and those suggestions stand. They get 2 stars for location and a nice array of TV's for game day. They lose 3 stars for poor service, poor price for quality, and underwhelming ambiance. They can do SO MUCH BETTER...And until they change things, you can do so much better as well.Alice Cooper'stown is directly across the street from the US Airways Center (home to the Phoenix Suns.)  When I first visited the restaurant, the Suns were putting their finishing moves on the Utah Jazz (84-87), and I suppose it was due to the game that business that evening was slow.  However, for me, it didn't matter.  Besides paying respect to Mr. Cooper, an episode of "Man vs Food" wherein Adam Richman and Alice--the shock-rocking legend himself--attack 22"-long "Big Unit" hotdogs was motivation enough: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C86akA3G6rg.The "Big Unit"--smothered in "Nightmare" Chili, bacon, cheese sauce, sauerkraut, jalapeños, diced tomatoes and onions, sweet relish, and shredded cheddar--is jaw-dropping!  In fact, upon delievery, fire alarms--shrilling throughout the restaurant--direct full attention to this behemoth as it snakes its way toward its next victim: me.  Respectfully named after the now-retired, 6'10" Arizona Diamondback, Randy "The Big Unit" Johnson, this dog headlines.  At $19.99, it seems a bit steep, but I couldn't eat more than a third.  Along with the fries, it easily feeds two or three.  Divided, the cost is more than reasonable.The "Elaine Benes" Big Salad, the "Johnny 'Beef' Depp", the "Al McCoy" ["The Voice of the Suns" since 1972] Crispy Chicken Salad, the "John O'Hurley" ["Seinfeld's" J. Peterman] Buffalo Chicken Wrap: the menu items definitely hail celebrity.  But why not?  The fare--along this guitar-lined, autograph-infused, rock-n-roll museum--is meant to be fun.  And it is.  Even though, on this evening, the locals were instead supporting their beloved Suns, I had a great time with my friends.  Cooper'stown is worth a try.I will say that it's an interesting touch that the servers and bartenders should adopt the Cooper-esque eye make-up--it's cool--but our server wasn't enthused: his bother-me-not attitude and poor service had me questioning his allegiance.  I mean, you work at Cooper'stown!  I know that between two servers and four tables, feeling as though you're in the weeds at times is natural, but couldn't you at least "feign" appreciation and interest?  The manager, however, checked-in on us, refilled our drinks, and asked about our visit.  I think he's quite aware.Note to Mr. Cooper:  When I was a kid, Alice Cooper album covers completely unnerved--yet intrigued--me.  I was ten, and I remember visiting our neighbors--hard rockers to the core--who had many of your LP's resting against their metal-plated, knob-heavy component stereo system in their living room.  I would walk around their house pretending I was cool and ignoring--or at least attempting to ignore--your nightmare: I couldn't look you in the eye.  At Cooper'stown, however, upon the slightest chance that you might drop in, I'd kept an eye out...just in case!  I'm not afraid anymore...I don't think.   =]   Nevertheless, for your music, your vision, and your endeavors, I'm a fan.  And I thank you.22" wiener, $27, meh. http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=4ZfcCa4m5RWvO4EFzfYm1AI know it's unfair but I have to compare all hot dogs to what you can get at Costco for $1.50. And in this case, I would have happily forwent the baguette, chili, bacon, cheese, kraut, etc. etc., for a dozen Costco dogs and Polish dogs. Here, the massively long and narrow wiener was overcooked to the point where the skin was starting to crinkle and pull away from the meat (that's what she said? Ew). Add too many par toppings and you have an overpriced novelty dog at an equally novel bar-type thing. Fun if you're an Alice Cooper fan or need a bar to get sloshed and watch games at. But this review is just for the dog.Now this is what I call a good time! Double References Everywhere! Alice Cooper meets Cooperstown: music and baseball collide to bring this interesting food experience. I appreciated the attention to detail, from the servers' eye makeup to the live music outside, even in the 100 degree Phoenix heat. Now that, ladies and gentlemen, is dedication. You can try the Big Unit, of Man vs. Food fame....enough Unit to feed 3 people comfortably. Trust us, we did it. Every time one comes out of the kitchen, lights flash, and the servers all yell, "BIG UNIT!" Love the play on words, plus the reference to the Randy Johnson, as Alice Cooper'stown is two blocks down from Chase Field. We ordered a regular 22' dawg, not the one with all the fixin's. Delish! I was also a fan of the Bloody Marys, mac n' cheese bites, and the beer selection. A very cool stop before a baseball game at Chase Field! Bonus: Go shopping! Tanks, tees, and auction items are available.
Quiet Storm Vegetarian & Vegan Cafe=I'll be honest, this wasn't our first, second or even third option for breakfast, but when it came to early Sunday grubbing with a group of six, this was pretty much the only place didn't have a two-day long wait. In fact, there was no wait at all when the six of us popped in a little after noon on the weekend. Odd, but my group was hungry so we didn't question the kismet. The restaurant is pretty enormous as far as cafes go, and it's nice because they don't pack the tables on top of each other so you're never going to be crammed next to a crying baby or having to scoot your chair in every time the table next to you needs a coffee refill. The furnishings all appear to be second hand finds as well as local art and LOTS of owl statues. It's a hoot, for sure. One weird thing is the one bathroom with the sink outside, so if you're sitting in the back you can heavily monitor who comes out and doesn't wash their poopy hands. On the other hand, if you go to the bathroom here you'll likely feel like you have to make your hand washing some sort of big production so the other people in the back will take notice of your exceptional hygiene habits.I was feeling pretty sick still and actually brain washed myself  into believing that my weekend bug was actually morning sickness so on top of already feeling super nauseous and not hungry, and naturally my non-motherly instincts wanted to starve whatever demon might be brewing inside me but the hypothetical baby's daddy insisted I eat something and took it upon himself to order me the tofu scramble, which I was sort of excited to try despite feeling otherwise very green. It was actually very bland and dry and even though I think it was only like $3, I think I would have rather had the $3 in my pocket than the scramble so I took a few bites and then pawned it off on the boo who insisted I try his veggie breakfast burrito. The burrito was the total opposite of the scramble- absolutely outstanding and even though it was the size of a guinea pig, I think I could have downed the whole thing (of course, I would have blamed it on my imaginary incubating child and said I was eating for two). Going around the table, everyone seemed content with their food, besides the grits order that were decidedly bland, but that's kind of how I've come to think of grits in general. Our service was great and though most of the table's food was just okay, that burrito, the owl statues and the house horchata I ordered as my beverage really made the experience for me. I guess what I'm trying to say is that I can understand the 3-star average on Yelp, but that I think you can totally come here and have a 4 or even 5 star time if you order wisely. Just remember: Burrito, horchata and time the bathroom-goers for extra entertainment. PS- I'm so NOT pregnant (in fact, can someone get me a heat pack a few dozen Midol?), but thanks for your concern.I don't think I would have known about Quiet Storm if it hadn't popped up several times in friends' Yelp feeds in the last couple years.  I'm all about veg/vegan restaurants, but I have to agree with other reviewers who wish Quiet Storm's food was *slightly* more interesting.  Husband and I ordered take-out so we could enjoy a late lunch al fresco at Schenley Park overlook.  Folks working were vegan-hipster quirky, but friendly and helpful.  We ended up waiting about 30 minutes for our food, so we decided to partake in an afternoon coffee to pass the time.  I  had an iced Morroccan latté with cardamom and rose,  husband the Mandorla sweet almond milk latté.  Both were excellent.For my meal I picked the Tahini Bowl with brown rice, spinach, roasted red pepper, tomatoes, pepitas and fried tofu cutlet with a tahini dressing.  I wished there had been less rice and more dressing; the bowl was also screaming for more seasoning.  Husband opted for the Crunch Wrap Extreme: scrambled tofu tossed with celery, carrots, edamame, kale and spinach, dressed with vegan wasabi mayo.  Again, twice as much dressing would have added flavor and moisture to an otherwise fine wrap.And that's just it: the food at Quiet Storm is fine.  When really, I'd been hoping to be utterly wowed by the magic capable of being worked by nothing more than mere vegetables, plain grains and humble legumes.  Still, I won't discourage you from eating here.  I just might come back myself.It had been a very very long time since I'd visited Quiet Storm. For some weird reason, I had in my head that they made these awesome smoothies. Well... they do not. But they make milkshakes. Any other day I would have totes been into the shake but...I reeeeeally wanted a smoothie, so I opted out of the milkshake (I know, a rare occasion), and went with a iced chai. I love that they make their own mix of chai and they also don't sweeten it, so you can sweeten it yourself. Super sweet chai is super gross. Just sayin'. I also ordered the Sesame Noodle Platter (noodles, soy, tofu, red cabbage, mushrooms, broccoli, onions, peppers) with a ginger carrot salad. It was a solid meal. I mean, it wasn't necessarily a platter (I think a variety of separate items), but a noodle dish. I liked that there was a decent amount of veggies and not just a few, with a massive amount of noodles. I hate when that happens! It was also lightly sauced, not too heavy and sticky. Plus the fried tofu was awesome! Honestly, I've never had such good tofu before. I rarely get it because I think tofu can be so bland, but this was bomb! A nice plus is it's a great environment to eat and work. Free WiFi and nice big tables to work on. Plus, throw in friendly service and it's a win!
Chili's Grill & Bar Catering=Why does it smell funky here? Why does my bf like it here? Why am I yelping Chili's?A)Clean your mop before mopping up the entry. Maybe it won't smell like my Aunt Hazel's pantry then. B)Well, he's young, and chain restaurants seem like a safe bet to him. They're a safe bet to me. However, not in a pleasing way. C)Cuz I actually like the fajitasIf you like deep fried shoe leather smothered in canned gravy. Hey, go for the chicken fried steak. If you like a combo plate with all the flavor and spice of Scandanavian food. By all means, order the combo plate.  And if you like dining amidst screaming babies and folks with the culinary palette of a middle school student. Hey, Chili's is your place. Bon Apetit and o freakin' lay!
Donatelli's Italian Food Center=I've now been to Donatelli's multiple times, and have sampled several of their products, so I feel that I can review it comprehensively. Overall, I've been pleased with most of their products, the prices, and the customer service and atmosphere, hence the 4-star rating.As others have mentioned, the space is rather cramped and chaotic, esp. during peak business hours (e.g., Sat. around noon, when I last stopped in).  The layout when you walk in is a bit strange, to the point that I inadvertently ended up behind the counter on my first visit.  (Stay to the left and you won't have this problem.)  The most crowded section of the store is the deli counter, where you can obtain not only meats and cheeses, but a variety of made-to-order sandwiches and sides.  If you visit the deli counter during peak hours and are feeling indecisive, take a number right away--trust me, you'll have plenty of time to decide what to get as others are being helped.As for the grocery products, there is enough variety that you can find several versions of most Italian ingredients you'll need here, as well as other general grocery items like milk and ice cream. In general, prices are very reasonable-- generally less expensive than Groceria Italiana.  Unlike Groceria Italiana, a good portion of the product consists of commercially-available brands--albeit many that you wouldn't encounter in a mainstream grocery store like Giant Eagle. Having said that, the main attraction for me is the made-in-house items, such as the fresh pasta, the sauces, and the biscotti, as well as the hot meals.In the interest of brevity, here is a list of products I've bought at Donatelli's, followed by price, recommendation, and comments:Grandma's plain sauce ($3.65): Recommended--Better flavor and seasoning than commercial jarred sauces (e.g., Ragu, etc.)  Also, I like that Donatelli's makes meatless red sauce, unlike Groceria Italiana, since I don't eat beef.Lobster ravioli ($9.99): Not recommended--After following boiling directions (necessary to avoid curdling cream sauce via baking), pasta was good, but filling was mushy.  Also, included imitation crabmeat, and I'm not a fan of imitation foods.  I'll be sticking to Groceria Italiana's handmade ravioli from now on.Ricotta pie ($5.49): Recommended--Though this was my first time trying it, I was favorably impressed with the flavor and texture.Biscotti ($3.52): Recommended--I've only had the spumoni biscotti (a flavor I haven't seen elsewhere), but it tasted fresh and was good.Italian bread ($1.50): Recommended--Soft and fresh, and inexpensiveHot food from deli counter: Recommended--I had the half pound fish sandwich ($2.49) and a half pound of the white cheddar bake ($2.99), and both were very good.  Notably, the roll was proportional to the fish, so the sandwich didn't fall apart, as is common at other PGH eateries serving fish sandwiches.Despite how hectic Donatelli's can be during peak hours, I've been impressed at the friendly service that I've received at the deli counter and checkout.  If there's one drawback, it's that waits at both counters are inevitable during these times.  Of course, if your schedule permits, this problem can be avoided by simply visiting at non-peak times.While Donatelli's may feel kind of cramped and may not seem as immaculately clean as some big box grocery stores (at least for the section the customer sees), this is part of its charm as a neighborhood ethnic grocery store.  I'll definitely continue stopping in for certain Italian grocery items, such as the plain sauce, biscotti, and bread, as well as for inexpensive, delicious hot lunch items.I love this place. Love that I can walk to it, that it has an amazing deli, some amazing frozen marinara sauces, and that the customer service is just great.I tend to come here for their fresh breads on Saturday, their grandma's marinara, and just the random things that I may forget at the regular grocery store. Oh not to mention they have 3 types of prosciutto!! Three!!  Anyway, they also have a ton of nuts, and sweets, as well and a boat load of olive oil. One thing that they are limited in is their produce, don't expect to get anything too crazy here.  Either way, this place is just clutch in order to have a good Italian dinner prepared at home. That or just to pick up some milk, eggs, and some deli meat!!I totally recommend this joint!!
Romano's Macaroni Grill=09/09/102.5 stars!I'd acquired a gift card, so we decided to have an early dinner here before catching a show at AMC.  I asked if complimentary bread was available.  The server said it was, and would we like some olives w/ it?  "Sure!," we chimed.  Rosemary focaccia w/ olives tasted wonderful, although the olives were, naturally, very salty.  Were we told that the olives would cost extra, we probably would've passed on the suggestion (since my Mom isn't gaga over olives due to their saltiness).  I'd recently added eggplant to my diet, so I was on an eggplant kick.  We therefore had to try the eggplant parmigiana, which came w/ capellini pasta and a side salad.  I also wanted to try their spinach salad w/ blue cheese.  I don't know, but whenever I read "candied walnuts" in an entree's description, I just have to order it!The side salad was a lot bigger than any side salad I've ever encountered before; it was big enough to satisfy us until the main entree arrived, but there was the extra insalata blu to contend w/.  It was good, but we both favored the side Caesar salad.  The dressing was just perfect for the amount of greens present.  The eggplant parmigiana was a big disappointment!  My first two bites were a mix of eggplant, pasta, and cheese, and I found the combo to be very bland.  I then tried the eggplant and the cheese on its own, and I was dumbstruck to find that the eggplant tasted like the cheese, and vice-versa!  Even the pasta tasted the same as the veggie and the cheese.  I tried the part where the server added parmesan cheese, and there was no added flavor there, either!  Since I did not find satisfaction w/ the entree, I started craving for something sweet-- the vanilla gelato w/ strawberries was the answer :)  Mom didn't care for this dish, but no worries!  More for me!!The best thing out of our experience at Macaroni Grill that afternoon was that when the main entree was delivered, our server had automatically split the entree onto two plates WITHOUT OUR HAVING TO ASK!  This simple act impressed us both and garnered this review an extra star :)I'd like to give MG another chance, but w/ so many great non-chain Italian restaurants in the valley, I'll find it hard to justify going back so soon.
Louisianne's=Awesome food. Definitely a good place to eat if it is your first time in Madison, WI.The moment you walk in you are transported into another time and place. They had live music that fit the scene, made the atmosphere, and stayed background enough to have a conversation - check it out Tuesdays through Saturdays.Order the pecan catfish with the crawfish BBQ on top, aka "Maria's special". It sounds wacky but the pecans really go with the blackened catfish. The tasso and shrimp fettuccine - a combination of shrimp, smoked ham, and mustard cream sauce sounds like a questionable combination but it is soothing, hot soul food at its fanciest. Everything we ate had depth, richness, and finesse. If you are a soup snob, definitely get the soup over the salad option. Presentation was lacking but I don't think that's the point of soul food.  Service is sassy but whole-hearted. We walked in without reservations at 7pm on a Friday and when we asked if we could sit at the bar we were told "yeah, if you can find seats".  We found a couple stools and ordered dinner at the bar. It isn't bend over backwards service, but they are real people and sometimes that's better. Maria, our bartender who's worked there 13 years, gave excellent food and drink recs and was really attentive despite the rush - she basically made our night. It's a great place to bring guests if you want to head off to a chill and unexpected place. Even better if you're prepared to stuff your faces with well-executed comfort food. Try the Sazerac if you want a stiff, sweet drink and the Hurricane if you want a fruity, refreshing beverage that punches like a Long Island. The crowd here is mature and casually well-dressed.My husband and I went to Louisianne's recently after we sold our condo and got a Middleton Chamber of Commerce gift certificate from our real estate agent (Leslie Blum, she's great!).We wanted to use the opportunity to have a special date night and go somewhere a bit more upscale than we usually do. Having never been to Louisianne's in the 5 years that I've lived in Middleton, I suggested we try it out.I give the atmosphere of this place a solid five stars. Although it has an rather bland looking storefront, the inside of the restaurant is anything but. You walk into Louisianne's and immediately head downstairs. It's all stone and looks like you're walking into a cool cave or something. It's dark, but there's a lot of ambiance. I've been to New Orleans, and it definitely has that sort of vibe to it. It's romantic, fun, and not what you'd expect from the outside. I felt like we were on vacation while we were there. Also, there was a live jazz band playing and they were really rocking. It was awesome!We went at about 8pm on a Friday night had to wait about ten minutes for a table, which was fine. While we waited, we ordered drinks at the bar and watched the band. I had red wine, and my husband had Jameson on the rocks. We were seated and ordered the Pecan Crab Cakes as an appetizer. They were good, probably just 3 stars though, as they tasted a lot like other Midwestern crab cakes that I've had before. They were heavy on bread and light on crab...with a lot of Old Bay seasoning. Again, they weren't bad at all, but not spectacular.Next, we ordered some more wine and our entrees (more on those in a minute).  We were given a choice of soup or salad with our entrees and we each ordered soup. They had two soups of the day: a shrimp -corn chowder (which I got), and a tomato-based pulled pork stew that was like chilli (which my husband had). Both soups were fantastic! Definitely 5 stars for the soup. I'll take a minute here to comment that I enjoy going to traditional restaurants from time to time, places where soup/salad and bread are included with your meal instead of everything being ala-cart. (It reminds me of dining in Wisconsin supper clubs as a child). By the way, the bread basket was delicious and was quickly replenished by the waitress after we ate all of the bread within 30 seconds of sitting down because it was warm and toasty (and served with soft butter) and we were starving! Onto the entrees! My husband absolutely LOVED his dish. He claims that it was possibly "the best thing I've ever had in a restaurant". He chose the Coffee Roasted Chicken, which featured a bed of (homemade) fettuccine topped with a coffee-crusted bone-in grilled chicken breast, in a "hazelnut, orange, ricotta sauce". I think there was spinach in it too. The pasta was perfectly al dente, the grilled chicken moist, and the sauce was rich and creamy. It almost reminded me of a Thai peanut sauce, but with hazelnuts instead. Although it sounded like something that could become cloyingly sweet, it was not. It had a nice subtle umami essence in addition to the sweetness. Delicious. 5 stars.The reason that Louisianne's is not getting a five star review from me, however, is due to my entree, which I felt was very underwhelming. We don't eat pasta at home for health reasons, so I usually get it when we go somewhere nice as a special treat. I chose the tasso and shrimp fettuccine because it was homemade pasta, and because it featured authentic New Orleans style ingredients (for the unfamiliar, tasso is basically spicy ham). The shrimp and tasso pieces in my pasta were well-cooked, but they were sparse. The dish also featured mushrooms, and they were fabulous...probably the best part. However, the pasta was supposed to have a "Creole mustard cream sauce", and it didn't really. The sauce was very light, and had little flavor. It was kind of sad, because I was really hoping to be wowed and I wasn't. I'd say my item was probably 3 stars, and would have been awesome if only the sauce had been a bit more pronounced and flavorful. The service was adequate. Nothing remarkable in either a good or a bad way.Summary: I'd definitely return. I think Lousianne's Etc. is a decently nice restaurant overall, and is great for special occasions. Their primary issue, from both my own experience as well as the reviews on Yelp, seems to be consistency. Some menu items are fabulous, and others are meh. The major problem with this is that Louisianne's  menu is at a price point where people only go occasionally...so the restaurant basically has one shot to impress, and if they fail at that, guests won't return for a second chance. I think this explains why the Yelp reviews for Louisianne's are so polarized.This little place has been on our list for awhile and we finally made it last Friday night!  It was a cold windy night, so descending into a warm cozy basement space seemed to fit!  We were greeted by a cheery hostess who promptly seated us at a corner table.  Johnny Chimes was at the piano, which set a perfect tone for the evening.  Our waitress greeted us and we ordered up some fabulous food!The shrimp and corn chowder was perfectly creamy, spicy, and loaded with shrimp.  Our entrees were the Etouffee with crawfish and the roasted shrimp.  The etouffee was deliciously spiced with a generous portion of crawfish that tasted like mini lobsters!  The roasted shrimp were outstandingly fresh and served over a bed of lightly wilted spinach with balsamic glazed onions and topped with parm...so fresh and delectable.Friendly service, cozy space, outstanding cajun cuisine...we will definitely be going back!
Ruby Tuesday=We walked in expecting everything to be new and fresh...like the commercials say??? Well ehhh wrong, there was new menus however. My friend said "Maybe they come and switch out the lamps after you sit down just like on the commercial?" We had fun with this so he asked the waiter. The waiter informed us that they are one of the few that will be staying with the original theme Tiffany lamps and all. After he left I thought to myself....What if they didnt change any of them?!? What if they give you that BS story at every RT you go to?!? What if they get away with it??? Somone should confirm this for me!!Fresh Avocado QuesadillaPerfectly ripe avocados, grated Swiss cheese, and freshly made pico de gallo in a grilled flour tortilla. Very good for a veg-o-saurus like me mmmm I will go back. The new menu was the only reason I tried RT food again I usually just drink there for HR.
The Saloon of Mt. Lebanon=I have been robbed twice by the Saloon.  Someone there likes to write in tips so if you use a credit or debit card at the Saloon make ABSOLUTELY sure that you check you bank statement the next day. After the first time I wrote it up as a mistake on my part or their but the last time I was flabbergasted.  I went in on some Yeungling special night, ordered one beer, and wrote a dollar tip.  The next morning I checked my statement and I had been charged 25.00 for that single beer.  This is not only a bad business practice but it is illegal and fraud.  But they will keep saying it was an 'accident' as long as they can get away with it.  If you do have to go here I IMPLORE you to only use cash and look at your change carefully. This bar should be your absolute last resort in Mt Lebanon.At closing time as well, get ready for the Mt Lebo Police Dpt to pull up outside and start hassling people who are WALKING HOME.  There are other great bars in Mt Lebanon that are far more deserving of your money.
Alexander Michael's=We had one night to go out to dinner during our recent Charlotte visit, and Al Mike's is where my friend wanted to take us.  Of course, I had to look up the reviews on Yelp before I agreed, and once I did, I was sold.  And now that I've been, I must say, Charlotte Yelpers, you are right on with this one!I love this incredibly charming historic restaurant and the 4th Ward neighborhood that surrounds it.  AM's atmosphere is warm and inviting.  Luckily, we arrived early on Saturday night (around 6:30), so we didn't have to wait for a table... (The restaurant did, however, fill up within a half hour).The highlights in my eyes:*great beer selection!*fried pickles! *burger*onion ringsIt was my first time ever trying fried pickles, and I'm a fan!  We devoured them as an appetizer for the table.  We weren't huge fans of the crab soup, and I'd stay away from salads... they are nothing special.The service was attentive with a snap of attitude.  I think they probably are friendlier toward their regulars, but that's fine by me.  If I lived in the area, I'd be a regular too!Need a good, unique date spot? Here's the place. Great little hidden gem in uptown's historic 4th Ward neighborhood.Food: First things first... whatever meal you get make sure to get a cup or bowl of the spicy crab soup. Money. Not so hungry or just want a snack? The fried pickles are spot on. The London Broil is just fantastic. The marinade they use on it is super delicious. Dinner version comes sliced up in entree form... lunch as a sandwich. You get a side item with both.Bar: They have a good selection of local beers. If the restaurant is busy and you can't get a table... sit here. The service is always top notch.Parking: there is a lot less than a block from the restaurant between Graham and Pine. There seems to be a lot of confusion surrounding parking here. I think a lot of it is because the signs are kind of confusing. You can park there for two hours without a parking permit. Bonus: had too much to drink and need to take a cab? The A Mike's staff will you show you where you can park your car overnight.I love to bring out of town guests here. Such a charming place in a great neighborhood. Warm, welcoming, homey atmosphere.Al Mike's is my shit.  Want to a good place for a first date? Check.  Want Triple C babymaker in pints? Check?  Want awesome food at a great price?  Chickity friggin check. l Mike's is located in a really awesome part of the fourth ward.  Tree lined streeets and amazing houses.  Al Mike's itself looks like an awesome house turned into a restaurant.  When you walk in, you kind of feel like its an irish pub from the 80's, but this character is what makes it cozy and awesome.  The kitchen is the size of a shoe box and I don't understand how they turn out such great food as quick as they do.  It must be some type of wizardry. They have a semi cajun menu and cajun fries are always a good side dish.  Their crab soup is out of control.  Things to get here are the pasta dishes, the chicken dish, and for a sandwich the London Broil ( medium rare of course!).  This is my ace in the hole whenever I have no idea what I want. I love you Al Mike's!
Wally's' American Pub N Grill=My first time here for lunch. I went with 2 other friends. What we had:Appetizer: artichoke and spinach dip with tortilla chips Lunch: fish and chips, and their special of the day meatballs.We got our appetizer and it was good. The fish and chips were a little on the greasy side, but what do you expect for fried fish and french fries. The meatballs... that's another story. They used a spice in it that had a very strong licorice taste (I think the spice is called anise). There were 4 meatballs for $7.95. I took a small bite off of one and almost gagged. I could not handle the licorice taste. I asked if I can substitute it for fish and chips and make it "to go" as we were running out of time. When the check came, they did not take the meatballs off and asked the waitress about it. Come to find out that the OWNER said "JUST BECAUSE I DIDN'T LIKE IT, I STILL HAD TO PAY FOR IT!". I WAS SHOCKED!!!!  I told her, then I didn't want the fish and chips. I only ordered a higher price item as not to walk out with only a $30 bill.  We ended up leaving paying $46, $8.00 for the meatballs that I only had 1 bite out of! It's a good thing I ate my share of the artichoke dip or I would have STARVED!I WILL NEVER BE COMING BACK HERE AGAIN!!!!!I've heard from several people that Wally's is like a Phoenix landmark... it's been around for awhile and they supposedly have a great happy hour!  Crazy that in my 3 years in Phoenix, today was my first visit to Wally's, but it won't be my last!I met 2 friends for lunch.  When we made our plans, they both suggested Wally's because of their convenient location and their 'caramelized vidalia onion & Guinness soup.'  I'm not a fan of french onion soup, but I really wanted to try Wally's anyways, so that's what we did!  I was acknowledged upon walking in by Chip, the General Manager... he was extremely friendly and suggested we sit outside since It was a beautiful day.  He was right - sitting on the patio was perfect!Service was attentive and cold drinks were brought out right away... we started with the hot artichoke and spinach dip for the table... yum!  Good thing I worked out this morning, because I didn't feel quite as guilty enjoying this delicious appetizer - it was really tasty, and a generous portion too!Of course, my friends Rachel and Lesley ordered the soup as planned - they both seemed to enjoy it.  I went with the Cobb salad.  It was your standard Cobb - with chicken, romaine and iceberg, diced tomato, egg, bleu cheese crumbles, avocado slices, chopped bacon, and balsamic dressing which I requested on the side.  It was good, but I think I was full from the chips and artichoke/spinach dip appetizer, so I couldn't finish it all.  Too full for dessert as well...I'll have to return to Wally's for sure though - they had a pretty impressive bar menu with a ton of liquor, beer, and martinis too!  I noticed they had a kids menu, and some of my favorite desserts as well (hot apple pie and carrot cake).  Wally's happy hour is from 4-6p M-F with $1 off cocktails & beer and $2 off all appetizers... I'll be back for more of that artichoke and spinach dip with a beer or 2 next time for sure!  See you there!What a great neighborhood restaurant! The atmosphere is cozy and friendly, the food is tasty and the prices are reasonable. What more can you ask for? We came here for dinner and sat at the bar but will definitely take advantage of their spacious outdoor patio next time. I ordered the veggie burger with a honey glaze coat which was amazing! My husband got the French dip and I stole a delicious bite. I want to order that next time. The sides were the best because they provide a mix of regular fries, sweet potato fries and onion rings! Perfection!
King Solomon's Pizza=Well, I'll have to begin by explaining (in answer to Gene's question about the sushi/pizza combo) that this is a kosher place. No, that does not mean that a rabbi has blessed you pizza. It does mean that the cheese on the pizza is vegetarian (i.e. no rennet);this is a vegetarian jointand it has a zany and off-the-wall menu which now includes a Mexican night (Wednesday?).I am a pizza snob to the core. King Solomon's has been hit or miss in the past as it has changed ownership a couple of times. I wanted to revisit today before writing a review. I ordered the lunch special- two slices and a drink for $5.99. The slices are AZ size as opposed to NY size. This is just fine by me- two slices fill me up nicely. The sauce is generous and flavorful. There was just a little too much cheese for me, which means it's light on the cheese for your average Zonie. The crust is thin and crisp.I have heard mixed reviews concerning the Israeli platter. I have not heard anything about sushi or Mexican here.Warning: KS is closed on shabbos: sundown Friday to sundown Saturday. Saturday night it opens and is subsequently flooded with families.Great place. Go.
56th St Deli & Market=You would never know it from the sign out front, but this little convenience store on 56th Street and Indian School is quite a gem!  I've been in a few times over the years for a drink or a snack or what have you, but today, I decided to go pick up a sandwich, and I was super impressed!"Proudly featuring Boar's Head," says the sticker on the saran wrap that sealed my sandwich, and it's featured on the sandwich board as well.  Boar's Head = quality, or so my husband has ingrained in my head.  He grew up on the stuff in Jersey!  Back to my sandwich... I ordered the turkey with the works on a wheat roll.  ($5.59) It was ready in minutes and totally hit the spot.  My only complaints were that they don't offer avocado and the store has a very limited chip selection.  (note to store - please order some sun chips!)On a positive note, they have picnic tables outside, although I took my sandwich to go.  I'll be back to this deli / market for sure - I live and work super close by!
Coco's Family Restaurant=My lunch here was just okay. Only prob is that I it took so long to get the food here. Not to mention the taste level is pretty much mediocre. Probably even lower. Service here was slow, or is it because it was just my unlucky day. In short, I had a not-so-good time here.
The Apple Dumplin'=Emphasis on the family restaurant, with family (whose?) photos on the walls.  Open, clean, bright ambiance.  Servers were efficient and friendly.  The breakfast menu was limited and not very appealing.  The coffee was okay.  I ordered the Giant Cinnamon Roll but was told they were out.  This was at 9:00 AM.  How do you run out with two hours left of breakfast?   I then ordered the Loaded Omelet.  It was, indeed, loaded with sausage, ham, bacon, veggies, and cheese.  It needed some seasoning and a bit more flavor but wasn't that bad.  On the side was fried potatoes and gravy.  It was good, but my doctor would kill me if she saw me eating that.  Definite artery clogger.  In all it wasn't bad but also not someplace I'd return, even to taste the elusive cinnamon roll.  NOTE: There are references in the other reviews that hint at prejudice, such as "be stared at for your entire meal if you happen to not be Caucasian."   While I was there, a black couple came in and seemed to be known by the staff and was greeted warmly.  An interracial couple later came in.  I saw no "staring" or any such behavior.
Wright's=They knew. They knew we were a rowdy, tipsy, cuss strewn restaurant gang. And they put us in back. Didn't matter. The entire room was magnificent. Carved concrete block. Mission style furniture blended with contemporary. Three ambiguously sexual servers. Really. How can you tell now days? But the food. The art on a plate. Sublime. And I don't even know what sublime means. I heard it on TV once. Just sounds good. Like the food I fed my pie hole last night. Perfectly seared sea scallop with a corn succotash, a Caesar salad so perfect AND served in a baked Parmesan crisp. That means, my dairy loving friends, that you consume the salad and then eat the bowl. Just like freakin' Dairy Queen. Damn! Filet Mignon, demi glace, baby veggies and the cutest little Dutch potatoes. Ever. Chocolate. Chocolate. Chocolate. Dessert was a chocolate cup with house made vanilla bean ice cream, crisp banana wafers with milk chocolate and German chocolate mousse cake. Toe curling happiness.It was so good I had start cutting myself. And pull out my hair. Both very trendy disorders. I hadn't had Cain Cuvee in years and it's great to know it's a meritage you can stick with. It was a magical evening. Oddly none of the Biltmore staying, tattoo adorned (yes it was indeed an interesting and large fellowship), churchgoers were dining here. Rumor has it they were eating Fritos, watching reruns of Highway to Heaven and deciding if the croquet field looked like a crucifix.
Ajo Al's Mexican Cafe=I dig this place. It's the closest thing to a sure thing in the area for me as far as Mexican food is concerned. The shrimp fajitas rock, as do the fish tacos, which are made with grilled pacific Hawaiian Ono - I think they come with corn tortillas, but they'll gladly trade those out for flour if you ask nice. They also come with a super tasty chipotle cream dipping sauce, but not enough in my opinion. Ask for more, they'll bring it. For vegetarians I recommend the mushroom enchiladas blancas or the spinach enchiladas, both of which are equally delicious - and rich. Bring the Lactaid if you're lactose intolerant. Oh, and apparently they've got a killer lunch menu - not sure how I've been going there for years and didn't know that. Oh, well, maybe it's because I usually go for dinner. Margarita ordering tip: go for broke. The base margarita blows. Yeah, it's way cheaper, but it tastes like you're drinking pure sweet & sour mix. Order their top shelf, whatever it is, I don't remember, think I had one too many last time I was there.This was the second time I have been to Ajo Al's.  The first time was about 10 years ago when I first visited Phoenix.  I remembered it well.  I like the atmosphere.  Warm and welcoming, lots of cool are and things to look at.  I did not know this was a chain until I read the other reviews.  This is no Chevy's though.  This is far better, in my opinion.  The chips and salsa are fresh and flavorful and plentiful.  The basket they bring you is huge!  I had chicken flautas and they were delicious.  They topped them with guac and pico de gallo.  The rice was fluffly and moist and the beans were good too.  I only had ice tea but that was some of the best ice tea I have ever had.  I don't know what made it so good.......I mean it's ice tea, but I downed two glasses of it in no time flat.  I know there are tons of other non-chain mexican places in Phoenix and I will try them all!!  I love mexican food!!  But I will come back to Ajo Al's too.  I'd like to try a margarita next time.  :)
Knock Kneed Lobster=Um, hello, this place has been open for over 60 years.  On that fact  alone they receive 5 stars from me.Do they have some magic type of fryers that no one else in the world has? I think so because I honestly couldn't tell my meal was fried at all. I had the fish, shrimp, and chips combo and every item was crispy, light, and as ungreasy as fried food can get.  The interior is old and outdated for sure and it's totally in the "hood" but who cares.  Darn good fish and chips IMHO.  ---PS, they have one of those pump thingies of ranch on their condiment bar so even if you don't like your meal just cover it in good old American ranch dressing.     Ranch makes everything better!Do I really have to give them even one star? In the area so i dropped in for a quick lunch.  Had the shrimp plate with fries. Here goes:1.  The prices are outrageously high considering location, restaurant decor and quality of food. You cannot have lunch here for less than $11 unless you order one shrimp.  Any local chinese buffet will give you shrimp for a lot less than that.2. My shrimp looked like long barrels rather than a shrimp shape. This is due to the fact that they cut the shrimp in the middle and almost split it to make it look longer.3.  The shrimp had too much batter.  At one point the "shrimp"( what was left of it after I took a bite), came out and the "barrel of fried batter" was left4.  The french fries were from a bag --frozen.Being from the East Coast, I know what fresh seafood tastes like. This is NOT it folks.  This place makes Long John Silver seem like a 5 star restaurant and it's a lot cheaper too.  It is an outrage as a "restaurant".  All they do is fry up every piece of seafood that YOU can buy frozen at CostCo or Sam's.Don't do this to yourself.  When you are in the area and hungry, go to the Jack in the Box across the street or some other fast food place. You'll be better off. and.... I cannot believe that the people who gave this place 4  and 5 stars are for real. They have to be the relatives of the owners.  There is no other explanation.
Chicago Hamburger Co=I am a carnivore.  There, I said it!  I love burgers!!  So of course when I drove by Chicago Hamburger Co. on my first week here in Phoenix I said "note to self......MUST try this place!".  Today marks my second week here in Phoenix and after a long week at my new job, I was hungry.  I picked up my daughter and we headed over.  First off if you are from Chicago or love Chicago, this is your place!  It is filled with memorabilia from the Windy City.  There are all sorts of street signs and things pertaining to Chicago plastered on the walls.  It's pretty cool.  They have two TV's and of course they had the Cubs playing on one of them!  Go Cubs!!  I like the sports like ambience.  It's nothing fancy at all, just basic tables and chairs and a few booths.  Now for the food.......Mmmmm good burger!  I had a wester burger.  For you fans of Carl's Jr. Western Bacon Cheeseburger....oh man, this one is far better!!  Real bacon right off the grill and cooked just right, nice and crisp, bbq sauce, cheese, and onion rings to top it off.  The burger was juicy and cooked just right!!  It was one of the best burgers I've had in awhile.  My daughter had a hot dog and scarfed it down and gave it a thumbs up so I knew it was good.  The onion rings were nice and crisp and I liked the batter they used.  Not super greasy either.  Nice!  The fries where crisp on the outside and fluffy on the inside...perfect!  They have Pepsi and the other usual sodas.  They also make milkshakes.  I'll have to try one next time.  Oh, and chili cheese fries......omg....I love those!  All in all this is gonna be one of my go to places here in Phoenix.  YUM!!!CHC is a valley institution. I've been a happy customer since I was a kid. Bob the owner is always happy to see you and is a great guy. At CHC the sliders are the stars of the show. Get several and be a happy camper. Also don't miss their shakes and fried zucchini.
Red Devil Italian Restaurant & Pizzeria=Man-oh-man, this place is da bomb! The So and I came in on a Wednesday night after slamming a few Long Islanders at the bar next door, so we were geared up for some serious grubbing. We were seated immediately and greeted by our server Alberto. Wow, this guy had a golden personality and was working his station like a champ. He was making great conversation with every table and attended to us like royalty. We ordered the fried zucchini & mushroom plate and a medium pepperoni pizza. The friend zucchini and shrooms were very tasty and we were provided plenty of ranch for dipping. Our pizza was delivered to our table still bubbling and with a warning from Alberto, "Now you two take it easy, this pizza is Super HOT and I can tell you from experience because I no longer have the roof of my mouth, Enjoy". So I lifted the toasty-melty-saucy slice up to my face, hoisted it into my mouth, sank my fangs into it, and almost fainted with pleasure. I swear I could hear Lou Rawls singing in my ear as I worked my way down the slice to the crust. This was one hell of a Pizza and a great price to boot. Dinner (Appetizer, Pizza, and Root Beer) for two under 20 bucks. I may have to give in and be a repeat offender next week. Oh well, I'll just tell them the Devil made me do it.(This review is for take-out service)Most people have a 'go-to' list of their favorite comfort food places, and emergency list that is used when you need tasty, predictable, and reliable. Red Devil Pizza is at the top of my list for great NY style pizza. Forgetting fancy pizza, this place offers really tasty pizza, at a good price for what you get. Red Devil uses quality ingredients, and doesn't 'church it up' (with apologies to Joe Dirt).If you are ready for an extra treat, ask for your pie to be 'well done', that gets you a bit of char on the crust, and takes it from good to great. The guys behind the takeout window work hard to make some of the best pie in the 602, so enjoy!I usually throw away those value pack coupon envelopes you get in the mail, but decided to look at them this time & see if I'd use any. I pulled out ones for the dry cleaners, zoo, a burger/hot dog joint & Red Devil. Most of them were for dine in only but a couple were for delivery as well, so I used the one that was for a 16" cheese (toppings were an additional $1.25 each) & 20 wings for $21.95. I had looked at their website before ordering & the combo (pepperoni, sausage, onions, mushrooms & green peppers-but we skipped the onions) sounded delish so we got that with the NY mild wings. They don't have their desserts listed on their website so I asked the guy who placed our order & decided on the cannolis (1 for me, 1 for hubs). He said it would be a lil over an hour & to my surprise it arrived in 45 minutes.The pizza was good, not Mamma Mia's good, but good! The wings were bomb; crispy, the right amount of sauce & they smelled amazing! The cannolis were pretty good but we didn't really prefer their "style". Instead of chocolate chips inside with the filling, the entire cannoli was dipped in chocolate. Total with coupon, $3 delivery fee & tip was $47. Not bad at all considering we will each be getting 2 or more meals out of it. We're fans & would definitely order from them again...maybe even dine in eventually!It isn't trendy.  It isn't fancy.  The chef isn't famous.  It is just plain good.I like Red Devil.  It is one of those places where ordering way too much pizza on purpose in order to enjoy it again for lunch the next day is perfectly normal and A-OK.  The service is consistently friendly, attentive, and happy to offer menu suggestions.  I can't comment on their wide variety of main dishes (which all look appetizing), because I can never tear myself away from the pizza.  What goes great with that pizza?  The Antipasto salad is fantastic - loaded with meats, cheese and even my favorite artichoke hearts.  A small is more than ample for two people to share.  Save some of that Italian dressing (presented on the side) to use as a dipping sauce for your pizza crust.  Instant breadsticks!  Speaking of pizza, Red Devil's graces a thin yet doughy crust with tangy sauce and generous evenly-distributed toppings.  My favorite, pepperoni and mushroom, tastes wonderful when re-heated for lunch the next day too!Go, sit in one of the bar's padded booths.  Enjoy an adult beverage or two (there are typically drink specials of some kind or another) and order a pizza big enough to take some home.  :)
Saba's Mediterranean Kitchen=Ick.It was one of those evenings when you toss dinner options back and forth, but nothing really sticks.  In retrospect, we should have stayed home.  Even in the barren, food-less space that is my kitchen, I could have done better.  However, lured by an ad boasting a "World Famous Gyro" for the bargain price of $5, off we went.Upon arrival, we were quickly greeted by a man I assume is the owner, shown to a table, and given menus.  A few minutes later, he came back to tell us he would send someone over to take our order.  Great.  Strangely, the waitress that arrived to ask us what we would like to drink couldn't/wouldn't take our food order, as someone else was actually our waiter.  Huh?  Well, we finally were able to order from our real waiter (who was very nice, by the way and the ONLY reason for 2 stars vs 1) and our World Famous Gyros arrived shortly.  Uh, no.  What I found on my plate was a pile of sauce wrapped in paper.  The entire gyro was drowning in tzatziki.  Now I happen to really like tzatziki, but but not to the point that I cannot even identify what I am supposed to be eating.  I scraped off as much as I could, but then only tasted overly salty meat, soggy lettuce and yes, sauce.  After a few bites, I waved the white flag of surrender - I just couldn't do it.Guess you get what you pay for....
Taylor's Cafe=After pigging out in SF for 10 days I made Gabi K promise to only take me to healthy restaurants during my trip to Phoenix. As soon as she picked me up from the airport she made good on that promise by taking me to Taylor's for lunch.I was leading towards ordering a fresh fruit bowl or maybe even a yogurt parfait when Gabi started raving about their tuna that's made with yogurt! How's that for healthy? And so I ordered this tuna in a wheat wrap (instead of the regular bread). My side choices were fries, greens, and sweet potato fries.  Since I'm trying to be healthy I knew I should get the greens, but turning down sweet potato fries is just silly! And so I ordered the sweet potato fries, which at least are healthier than regular fries! Well, my sweet potato fries never came to the table because the waitress soon informed me that the kitchen was out of sweet potato fries. A sign that I should have ordered those greens in the first place!The tuna wrap lived up to expectations and we received top notch service (thanks to our waiter Michael) throughout our meal.  I started to think I was in SF instead of Phoenix when the homeless man outside started soliciting us for money through the window, but Michael had a chat with him within minutes.Gabi K seems to be a regular here and I can see why....can't beat healthy, tasty food and fabulous service! Even if they run out of sweet potato fries from time to time...Why did I not visit here before??  I don't know how many spontaneous stops I've made at AJ's for sweets in the past... Had I known about Taylor's Cafe being just next door, I'd have stopped in for organic and locally-produced foods, instead of spending money on junk!  Am so glad I took the time to drive all the way to have brekky here-- I also found this plaza to be a quaint area to walk around.  Lots of nooks and crannies that hold promise for other good eats.  Any suggestions?Before stopping by, I briefly looked at the online menu and spotted Smoked Salmon listed.  However, upon inquiry, I was told that the salmon isn't wild-caught, so I had to bypass :(  But I wasn't disheartened much, though, since I was also hit with a major sweet craving (thanks to yesterday's viewing of "The Best Thing I Ever Ate: Sugar Rush," on DVR, while on the treadmill!), so I had the French Toast , made w/ two slices of Simply Bread's monkey bread (cinnamon pull-apart), strawberries, bananas, and a triple berry compote.  I also had a side order of Boar's Head smoked bacon.  I had asked for the toast to be "more well-done."  The same went for the bacon-- delicious!  [I'm crossing my fingers they weren't made w/ allergenic ingredients (I suspect they were), bec. I'd like to buy a package of this to prepare at home.]  I enjoyed every morsel of the French toast!  Loved the texture of the cinnamon-swirl bread, which I lavishly topped w/ the compote and fruit.  (I kept thinking I should ask for extra compote, but the portion was actually just right.  I would've enjoyed an extra slice of toast, though, but that's the monster in me with bigger eyes than my stomach talking!)  I also had a cup (or two!) of the special blend coffee, made by Starbucks, which I tempered its bitterness with a little 2% milk.  Great spot for breakfast!  Can't wait to try lunch here soon.  Too bad Taylor's Cafe isn't open for dinner anymore, or I'd plan for that, as well.  BTW, service was very friendly and fast!  While my server Kristen couldn't readily address my food issues, she was quick to offer to ask kitchen staff for the answers.  And she did this with sincere smiles, which I really appreciate!  Thank you, Kristen!Lovely murals; sectioned rooms that vibrate with differing, but positive, energies; polished and clean women's restroom; and nice furnishings complete my breakfast adventure this morning and make this cafe a winner!  Can't wait to come back, and I'm saying this as I finish off this review here at Taylor's Cafe!!
Pizzeria Uno=Low expectations. That's what I had when we stopped to have a bite before a movie. Not a big fan of deep dish, we were delighted to see "flat bread" pizzas offered. The sausage pizza, while could have been crunchier, was quite good. Service was great considering our friend was so dehydrated from being overserved the previous evening, he must have had a dozen ice tea refills. The ambience at these places kills me. It's like Oregano's married Cracker Barrel! There is crap all over the walls. Hey. Who's dusting this stuff anyway. I did notice quite a bit of dust and grease on the light fixture above our table. We attempted to try the pizza place a few doors away, but they were closed. I suggested Hooter's but before I finished saying it, we all squealed in all of our gayness...."Ewww...boobies!". So Uno it was. But I couldn't help think of that card game Uno. Damn that's a fun game. And I also couldn't get a guy from high school outta my head. His nickname was Uno. He got it one day in the locker room after gym class. You figure it out. I'll go again if I'm ever at the AZ Center. I just might bring my Windex and Endust however.
Mandy's Fish & Chips=I liked Mandy's because: * It's right off the light rail, so I can travel from work to here in a matter of minutes without having to deal with traffic. * Their catfish is wonderfully crispy and flavorful, pulled freshly out of the fryer. * They serve catfish all week long. But I'm not crazy about: * Those odd crackhead sitting behind me acting like they were playing hookie from high school. * The amount of time it took to prepare my meal. (Okay, this is one of those "I want it fresh but I want it fast" so I'll nullify the weight of this one. * Decor was nonexistent. If you're going and have limited time for lunch, I'd recommend calling in your order. All in all a very nice lunch and a good excuse to ride the rail over lunch.
Phoenix City Grille=Ok, Ok, Ok another strip mall restaurant in Phoenix. I get it. We can be a fab place in a drab space. Wow, how cool, I just came up with a new motto. But let me just say, PCG, as the regs call it, is a FAB place. Voted many times as a local hot spot or a great neighborhood spot, PCG actually shines on many levels. Yes, the space itself is not inventive or trendy. But why do we go out to eat? Mostly for some killer ass food. Well, you got it here sister. Appetizer: bacon wrapped shrimp stuffed with cotija....yowzaaa yowzaa Potsie. Yummy! The tenderloin rivals Ruth's Chris and any other high end steak place. The corn cakes are, well, let's just say I'd raffle off a limb for these babies. Pot roast is right off my Momma Jo's dining room table. The pork  tenderloin entree makes Miss Piggy cry and me, well I'm weeping already. Juicy, firm white meat with amazing sides. Services runs always a Bplus to and Aplus. Waitstaff knows everyone and is literally family to the owners and management. I LOVE it here. Now, the space. Yes, it's a mini mall. But they've made it iintimate and not sports bar like. The gang here has made a home run on  every level. It's like coming home everytime I eat here. EAT AT PCG people. It'll give strip malls a new meaning!The corn cakes and the bacon wrapped prawns. I would sell my mother for them. Does that make me a bad person? Or just really, really hungry?Phoenix City Grill is an institution, and it should be. My second dinner out, after I moved here with the Beautiful Carin, was at PCG (the first was at Tuchetti's, dear departed Tuchetti's...maybe not the best Italian food in town, but truly...was there ever a dish that could fill you up like their baked spaghetti with meat sauce?...it must have been 5 lb's. of food on the plate...my dear sweet lord).Anyway...I met a friend at PCG for lunch yesterday. I didn't get to pick...I don't get to pick the restaurants for client and friend lunches for a while...not since the sad and regrettable Frank & Lupe's incident.But, I was glad for change of pace...out of Old Town and my rut of wanting to walk everywhere I go. I fired up the Edsel and off I went to 16th and Bethany Home for a revisit of a Phoenix classic!PCG is PDG ("pretty damn good") food and attentive service.Mark had gotten there a little before me and gotten a table. The waitress was there as I was sitting down. Interestingly, Mark had gotten a big ol' glass of red wine to start lunch...a delightful way of lunching for business people that has fallen into disrepute over the past decade or so. I followed suit.We must fight this non-drinking at lunch scourge by taking every opportunity to imbibe at lunch, and I, for one, will help lead the fight!The menu hasn't changed very much over the past few years, but really, why screw around with what is working...the place is always full, everybody seems to enjoy their meals, including me BTW:), and they just go on printing money, year after year! What's not to like about that formula?They had some nice specials (including a bunch of seafood specials), but frankly, I rarely eat seafood at non-seafood specialty restaurants in the middle of the desert. I opted for the Cuban Hamburger. A novel preparation, one that was highlighted by some of the tastiest pickles I have ever had on a burger! I actually do taste the food as I hoover it down:)PCG is still doing great and doesn't need anything more from me than my credit card for payment when the check comes...keep up the good work!I went to add this to my newly made list of favorite brunch spots and couldn't believe my eyes.. I hadn't reviewed PCG yet!?!If someone were to ask me what my favorite brunch dish was, without batting an eye I would respond "Griddled corn cakes from PCG of course". Take corn cakes and cook them to perfection (you know with a few corn kernels stuck in there), stuff them with chicken, green chillis, jack cheese, serve them with salsa fresco, potatoes and black beans. This would also probably be my last meal on earth if I had a choice. You feeling my taste buds? It honestly doesn't get any better. Outside of brunch, the food here is amazing.  The Rose Lane Chicken, The Surf and Turf, any of the fish dishes.. Everything is made with quality ingredients nothing fancy and full of flavor. They do it right. I held my college graduation dinner here it is that good. I would recommend this to the pickiest of eaters, and it is great for groups.There aren't as many places with the service and friendly staff as PCG!  I've only been there for the Yelp event, but I will definitely go back based solely on the treatment we all got from the staff.The food was amazing with combos that were perfect.  The coconut shrimp was my very favorite and I am always down for fruit and cheese.This place is very close to home and I will become a regular, whether they like it or not.Phoenix City Grille knocked my socks off with some special treats they dazzled us with at a CMYE (Community Manager Yelp Event) and I recently returned with the generous buy-one-get-one voucher they sent us home with (it expires on the 30th, fellow Yelpers who haven't redeemed theirs yet). After the delicious scallops at our Yelp event, you can guess what I had my heart set on -- hopeful that there would be a special, since they are not a regular menu offering. Fortunately for me, there was a short rib and scallop special. It was accompanied by fried green beans. The sort rib was good. Definitely tender with a real hearty, rich, beefy flavor. There was only 1 scallop. It was a little tougher than the ones showcased at our event. Trying to minimize the calories, I asked for plain green beans instead. The kitchen sent out the fried which our server quickly noted and corrected, leaving the fried ones for my dinner partner to enjoy. Lacking any substantive willpower, I nibbled one or two and they were quite tasty. A light tempura coating combined with the cooking technique offered a unique, enjoyable flavor. My "plain" green beans were dressed in olive oil with garlic, salt and pepper (just like I make at home). Still crisp, they were delicious! So, I got my wish with the special, but the the regular menu challenges decision-making abilities with so many great options! My friend got the beef tenderloin and it was, quite possibly, the best steak I've had in the Valley. It was fabulously tender (even cooked medium well) and perfectly seasoned. I look forward to ordering one for myself on a future visit. I had heard about the bread pudding from the CMYE reviews and so we splurged with dessert. It was phenomenal! Think the fluffiest, most custardy french toast flavor you've ever had! Thank goodness it was cut into two pieces -- better for a peaceful sharing. Another tip from the CMYE, thanks to Don S., I tried the Brophy Clark Pinot Noir ($11/glass) and it was love at first sip! I liked it so much, I called Total Wine to see about buying a bottle for home and searched the vineyard's website for where to buy a bottle in Arizona but didn't get very far. I guess I'll have to add that to the reasons to return to Phoenix City Grille!PCG cannot fail to please. i have been twice now, once for a yelp event and once to use the coupon they gave me at said yelp event. Both times i was blown away by the delicious food i had here. The follow up visit i brought my best friend, the lovely Barbara G and we had an excellent time!The service is great, and i am especially fond of the waiter who took care of me both visits, gosh i wish i could remember his name...but without sounding...a little...too...glaad...not that there's anything wrong with that! he was a very handsome man....but i was genuinely impressed that he remembered me from the yelp event, and both visits his serving skillz were right on par. kudos! when we sat down and perused the menu I was still a little "dazed and confused" from my morning rituals *ahem* and everything on the menu sounded ridiculously good to me, it was getting so hard to make up my mind, i was floundering until my lovely friend Barbara suggested the bacon bleu cheese burger, a girl after my own heart!We then both ordered said burger, a coke for her and a pabst for myself. We gnoshed on those delicious burgers accompanied w/ garlic horseradish mashed potatoes ooooweee! Here was a dish that was so perfectly flavoured and well thought out and deceptively simple. without a shadow of doubt one of the best burgers i've had in phx. I would recommend PCG to any and all, and look forward to when i make my return.Matt and I dined here for our Christmas Eve dinner. Since this was the first time I didn't make the trip home to San Francisco for Christmas, I had absolutely no idea what to do with my Christmas Eve. Matt and I need plans! Therefore, after doing some investigative work on the internet as to what Arizonians can do in Phoenix on Christmas Eve, I came across PCG and their special menu for the holiday. Their prime rib and sea bass specials looked mouthwatering so I made reservations. In the end, this place did not disappoint!! I will unquestionably be back. I started out with a strong and tart pomegranate margarita that wasn't too sweet. I don't like it when margaritas are sugary so this one was perfect, and a great way to get my Christmas festivities started. For my main course I opted to try the sea bass special. It came with almond crusted asparagus and some garlicky (and insanely buttery) rosemary mashed potatoes. How would I describe the entire meal? In one word, perfection! That sea bass was so fresh and delicious it practically swam right up to my plate. You can't really go wrong with asparagus but this wasn't just your regular vegetable. They coated the asparagus with a crunchy layer of almonds and it was soooooo tasty. And yeah, the mashed potatoes tasted like they had about 5 cubes of butter in them... but that's the best way to make em!I wish I had known about this place sooner because it really is such a delightful restaurant. The atmosphere isn't too lively but it isn't too dull. Tons of families, friends and large groups filled the interior so PCG really suits any age demographic. I loved the decorations that they had up for Christmas, and I highly recommend dining here for any holiday. They really do an all around excellent job at providing an awesome dining experience. When I was there I also noticed that they have a really nice bar with an even nicer happy hour... so once I get the chance, I'm going to head right back here and try it out! Everyone in AZ needs to know about this place. It's one of those solid classic restaurants you can go to for pretty much any occasion. 5 stars to PCG!PCG is a really good, reliable place to grab some good food and drinks. Sometimes the service is amazing, sometimes it's pretty good, but it is always a safe bet.I recommend the cheeseburgers and margaritas. They are very tasty and pair nicely. The atmosphere is very comfortable, dark and cozy. This is a local spot, and neighbors use it as an excuse not to make dinner at home. Give PCG a try, and it will likely be in your standard rotation, and you won't be disappointed.  The only area I think PCG could improve is with desserts. As good as the meals are, the desserts just aren't as good or enticing- which is not to say they are bad, just not on par with the rest of the place.Walking into PCG on a recent Sunday for brunch, I wasn't sure what to expect.  The place was pretty much empty.  Coming off a few less than stellar recent brunch attempts at other local spots (why is it so hard to find good Eggs Benedict!?), I took this to be a less than favorable sign about the meal ahead...  Well, I was wrong...  PCG served some of my favorite things!A mimosa with fresh-squeezed OJ started things off nicely.   :) On to an appetizer - yes, even brunch deserves an appetizer!  I was happy to see Jumbo Bacon-Wrapped Shrimp on the menu.  Now that Wildfish no longer serves them, I have been hunting for a new favorite.  These were delicious - 4 large shrimp, stuffed with cojita cheese and wrapped in bacon - perfect with the accompanying chipotle-lime aioli.And last, the main event.  The Tenderloin Eggs Benedict was fantastic.  Two English muffins graced with generous slices of medium-rare tenderloin, poached (not overdone - hooray!) eggs and tangy hollandaise.  This masterpiece came with diced breakfast potatoes (not greasy at all!) and a small bowl of fresh fruit.  Yum!  Thank you, PCG, for renewing my faith in brunch.The Phoenix City Grill was described by friends as their local "Cheers" bar. Well, I have to tell you something. Although a Norm *does* frequent this joint I'd rather come here ANY day over the tv version. This place is swank! (Sorry friends. Your description needs tweaking.)I met my friends at the bar area. I parked out back and walked in via the kitchen area. I did NOT, however, realize I would be walking through a full on kitchen. NOPE. I closed the door in confusion. Double-checked the sign outside that said, "Enter Here" and proceeded. A very understanding employee provided me "directions" to the bar. The bar zig zags around to the hostess stand. This is nice so everyone is not lined up like soldiers and conversations flows. There are standing height tables in the bar area as well. The restaurant section has booths (noted on the way to the bathroom) and copious seating. There is also a private room for events behind the elegant wall of wine.Using the company's weekly email we scored a free appetizer. The "Red chile pork tacos" come two to a plate and are divine. Grilled pork tenderloin w/chipotle aioli & pineapple fennel salsa. YUM.Having had a late lunch I could not possibly justify a decadent dinner. But I desperately wanted to after the tacos. Alas, no. Instead, I enjoyed a mouthwatering cup of the daily soup (Friday is the chicken tortilla). The group shared something called "Crispy Eggplant Bites". Goodness!Red pepper relish, goat cheese, arugula and a sherry vinaigrette are layered over a crispy heavenly crunchy shell. What this heaven is made of I should have asked. But no, I was too busy inhaling to inquire. (Four to a plate. Big enough for a group to share. IMO. However, I could see a tipsy person opting not to. This stuff is seriously good!)I also fork sampled my neighbor's plate "The Original Griddled Corn Cakes". This is a neat mixture of sweet, spice and well, cheese. And I like cheese!I'd say I'd come back and eat these things again. But NO. I want to try different things *next* time. Brunch looks a-m-a-z-i-n-g. So does lunch. And all the great entrees I had to pass on. (Aww man!)With a full belly I understood the "Cheers" reference. You come here repeatedly. If you sit in the bar area look for Jose, JP & David. All three bartenders seamlessly moved between guests without missing a beat. Our glasses were never empty.  Even though we were waited on by all three of them service was transparent.Oh! And keep an eye out for the owner, Sheldon. He's making the rounds and greeting guests too!This place is super popular for good reason. If you're coming for a special occasion or with a larger group (which they can readily accommodate) I'd recommend a reservation.
Bodrick's Bar-B-Q Rib Tips=Bodrick's(family owned and operated) has been serving pit cooked bbq in the Charlotte area for 12 years and I am ashamed to say that I just recently got a chance to experience it.......I have definitely been missing out!I've been in Charlotte 16 years, and visited several bbq spots.....some that quite honestly shouldn't still be in existence and Bodrick's simply puts them all to shame. I'd put their rib tips, ribs, and bbq up against any of the local bbq spots without a doubt.....it's just that darn good. I'm talking about tender busting with smokey flavor meat with a kicking sauce! They call it 'Chi-town style', but I call it bbq done right!  The rib tips and bbq are their specialty but understand that they serve much more than that.....I also tried the lemon pepper wings, hush puppies, potato salad, mac n cheese, fries and lemonade which were all 5 star and easily, in my opinion, pushes them into the bbq/soulfood arena.....seriously! I can't wait to try the fish and shrimp on my next trip.   If I could suggest one thing, it would be to add bbq pulled chicken or turkey to your menu for the health fanatic in me:-)  Bodrick and his wife were a pleasure to talk with and they know bbq, and to the brother cooking.....you are the man!You'd be doing yourself a terrible injustice to sleep on this one as I had........
Szechwan Palace=Here is the deal.  You have to ask for the Chinese menu.  I am not saying this is right but if you are anything other than Chinese, they will hand you the "American" menu.  DO NOT GO THERE!!  Ask for the Chinese menu.  This is the BEST Chinese restaurant that I have eaten at in the states.  I lived in China for a year and this is truely authentic western China food.  I spent a couple months in Sichuan province in the west and you are getting exactly what is served there.  Try the "yu xiang rou si" literally translated, fish smelling small pieces of meat.  It is julienned pork in a wonderful sauce that DOES NOT  have any fish flavor or smell at all.  It is SO good.  One of my favs.  Also try the julienned potato with green pepper, wonderful!!  Ma Po Dou Fu is very traditional of the Sichuan province and known all over the country.  These guys make it right using the star anise which gives heat and a numbing quality of the mouth.  If this happens, it is authentic.  You will know what I mean when you have it.  Sichuan food is a bit oily which is authentic, a chile oil to warm them, since in the west up in the mountains that lead up to Tibet (known as the Gateway to Tibet) where the winters are very cold.Cha-ching! I got lucky my first time at Szechwan Palace! I had Helen Y. with me (Jason W. was along for the culinary experience as well), and she helped us navigate the Chinese menu, explaining about Szechwan cuisine and selecting some different dishes for us to try. I don't remember everything we tried, but the two standout dishes were definitely the fish filets and the water-boiled beef. The fish was cooked perfectly, with a creamy texture and a simple, sweet flavor. The water-boiled beef was spicy and so satisfying - my sinuses totally felt clearer as I ate it! I also enjoyed the soup buns. I'm not a big lamb fan, but the lamb riblets that Helen described in her review were good and would probably be a big hit with anyone who doesn't mind the gamier taste. The restaurant's atmosphere isn't anything to write home about, but the service was decent and the prices (about $15 a person) were definitely really reasonable for the amount and quality of the food we tried. Thanks to Helen for introducing me to this place. When I go back with my husband (or anyone else who can't read the Chinese menu), at least I will have a few already-established favorites to order!If you like spicy food, this Sichuan spot has your name written all over it!  Known as one of the Four Great Traditions of Chinese cuisine, Sichuan food can be described as spicy, hot, fresh and fragrant. When you are seated, if you are white, they will give you the "Whitey Menu".  Politely ask for the "Zhangguó cài dan" or "Chinese Menu" and you will be presented with a nice, leather bound, menu filled with the best this place has to offer.  I have tasted about 9 dishes from this place and each one was excellent. A word of warning, their hottest dishes are the "Water Boiled xxxxx" dishes literally drowning in mouth-numbing Sichuan peppercorns and can be a challenge for even the most seasoned spicy food lovers.  I believe they have toned it down a bit (I was actually told this by a 10-year vetran of this spot) and the last time I had it, it was significantly less spicy, but still about a 9 - 10 on a 10pt spicy scale.  Previously it was essentially inedible to my Nordic tongue, this last time it was enjoyable.... so buyer beware.I was going to go 4 stars, actually about 4.5, but given the fact that there is not a better Sichuan spot in AZ, it gets 5 stars.  Go, eat, enjoy.I AM AN IDIOTI've spent years bitching about the lack of even a DECENT chinese place near our house (Baja Arcadia). I kept looking to Scottsdale for somewhere to eat. We've got just about everything else, from real-deal taco shacks, to excellent Pho, to fine dining. But no real Chinese food. I was looking the wrong way. Up til recently, I would drive all the way to Wong's Place in Tempe just for the real stuff.THE CHINESE CULTURAL CENTERI shop regularly at what used to be Ranch99, that oasis in the desert that makes you feel like you've been transported to the Hell that is Riverside CA. I've tried numerous restaurants in the mall over the years and always been disappointed. The one I never managed to try is the Szechwan Palace. I expected it to be just another Gringonese disaster. Man was I wrong. We eat out maybe once or twice a week, and we've hit this place at least once a week since we found it a few months ago.SZECHWAN PALACEI love you, Palace. Dan Dan Noodles. Spice. Yu Xiang dishes. We've been when it's packed full of high maintenance Chinese businessmen and when we're one of 4 tables in the place. Every time, the tiny kitchen and the wonderful servers keep their smiles in place and just give you that little shake of the head that says: "Solly, it clazy tonight!" Even though this place pleases real Chinese food lovers, there's plenty of stuff to keep my Jewish mother-in-law happy too ("happy" is a relative term).THINGS I LOVE  - Wan Fu: the worst white wine in the world (that I love)  - Dan Dan Noodles with extra hot chile  - Yu Xiang Shrimp  - Mongolian Beef with real beef, not that over-marinated rubbery crap  - Fresh veggies that still have some color and snap to them  - Incredibly spicy Water-boiled dishes  - Any of their soupsWong's thick-skinned pot stickers are still the best, but everything else at the Palace rules.BOTTOM LINEIt's hard for me to imagine a bad review being credible unless some key person was missing or they were ridiculously understaffed and got slammed. We've been there for one of those nights though, and it was still very good, once we eventually got served. As others have said: get the real menu as you walk in. Otherwise, you'll get the Panda Express version. You'll also have to grab chopsticks. Other than that, just enjoy!Asked my friend where he wanted to go for his Birthday and this is where he choose.I had never been here before,so I was excited to try it out.Lots of parking here at the Chinese cultural Center.Nice looking place inside and out. The Cultural Center is a huge beautiful building. Something that Phoenix really needs. But, it looks as if there is quite a few empty business spots here.We were seated right away,but it did take a while to get our tea. Very quickly though they brought our soup. It was hot and Sour and was very good.The lunch specials are huge plates and you can choose white rice or Brown. No substitutions on anything ,which is the norm.They dropped off the check and you pay it at the front counter. But 3 people were up there and they were all yelling in Chinese at each other about something.Four patrons were waiting to check out in a line and the were not helping anyone. It was a bit crazy. But, luckily we were not in a hurry.Nice place but, I think I like Mui's in Tempe better. My kung pao was not that spicy for some reason.Still worth a try.Close to the Airport. It is a great location.
Fortune Cookie=You can't beat their lunch special.  We walk over from CPCC a lot for lunch & it's cheap, tasty & you get quite a bit of food.  Be warned, if you order the entree dinner size, it's more than enough to feed 2 people!  We made the mistake of ordering 2 dinner sized entrees one night & had enough for 2 more meals.  Their beef & broccoli is delicious!
Harmony Bar & Grill=If I could give the Harmony less than one star, I would. I live in the Shenk-Atwood neighborhood, so I'm not writing as an outsider. I've been to the Harmony many times, but I'm finally done being abused by the notoriously unfriendly owner, bartenders and waitstaff at the Harmony. The Harmony is worse than Seinfeld's Soup Nazi because there's no irony or humor in being treated the way the employees here treat their customers. I won't get into specifics. I can only say that I take pride in my neighborhood. My wife and I frequent those establishments that understand that they are part of a community and treat their paying customers as such. The Harmony is a black mark on our neighborhood, and I am ashamed that unsuspecting visitors to the quaint east side should have to endure the abusive, disrespectful and generally unapologetic service at this establishment. If you scroll down you'll read other comments about the owner's girlfriend who is now manager. The last time I was in there with a group of friends, she couldn't have been more rude or insulting. When we all said we wouldn't be back, she merely shrugged her shoulders. If you're visiting the East Side, there are plenty of other places that serve great food with friendly service. Alchemy, Mickey's, Wilson's, The Weary Traveller all come to mind as places that will make you feel and taste the love on the East Side.  If you're a masochist, be sure to head on over The Harmony for your daily dose of abuse. You've been warned. You certainly won't catch me sitting at this bar ever again.
El Pollo Loco=I rarely do fast food, but every now and then, I find it convenient, cheap, and oh so appealing, especially when fast food drive-thru windows exist!So, on a recent Sunday, upon realizing that I had two hungry kids in the car and nothing too appealing at the house to eat, I made my way toward El Pollo Loco, entered the drive-thru, and within 10 minutes, was headed home with a feast for all!I ordered a salad for myself, some chicken nuggets and sides of mac and cheese, corn, broccoli, and french fries for the kids.  However, I arrived home to find that they forgot to include the broccoli.  Bummer.I liked my salad and the kids liked the nuggets and fries.  The other stuff, not so much, but there's always something that doesn't get eaten at my house with 2 little ones that are hit and miss picky eaters.  I noticed El Pollo Loco offers some family style meals and everything is moderately priced, so I may just return again soon to try more from the menu.
Dave & Buster's=This was actually the first time I've ever been to a Dave and Buster's.Walking into such a huge space, especially coming from the often narrow venues in San Francisco was strange.Un-nerving actually. Because Dave and Buster's is all about excess. Almost obscenely so.As far as food - their stuff is standard. Most of it is fried and as another reviewer pointed out - not very healthy. At all actually. You have to really scour the menu to find some somewhat decent viable and nutritious options.But most people don't come to Dave & Buster's for food. They come for the games.And while I've never been that into video games or arcade games - my brother and sister always have.  I was apprehensive about having a good time here  - but after awhile - my siblings' enthusiasm about the place became contagious and I found myself really enjoying myself.Especially once i realized that I have mad skills at Skee Ball. And proceeded to dominate.Trust.
Wendy's=This is the Wendys that made me never want to eat at Wendy's ever again.  To think I gave it a second a third and even a FOURTH try!  I guess convenience gets dollars but after so long, you'll stop getting mine.The employees here are always fighting when you go in about shift changed and duties and the attitude carries itself right over to the register.  The management isn't any better telling me to go somewhere else if I don't like it then.  This place is the reason people scoff at giving $15 a hr to fast food employees.  The frosty is never frosty always runny.  The burgers are slapped together and the dining room looks more like a daycare after a long day than a place you would want to sit down and eat.The only good thing about this place is the exit so you can swiftly leave and never come back.This Wendy's is not the best one in town, but the staff here is really sweet.  My co-workers and I go to Wendy's every Friday.  It is nice when you walk in the door and they say hi to us by name. Then when you order your food they already know what we would like to order.   The location of this Wendy's is across for the VA hospital.  So you will see a lot of doctors or nurse here and sometime patients.  I will say that this Wendy's could use a makeover.  Hopefully one day they will, and then people may want to actually eat here.
D's Six Pax & Dogz=If you're like me, you probably enjoy watching people eat hot dogs and will want to make D's a destination when hanging in the 'burgh. What? I can't be the only one. Seriously? Fine. Then excuuuUUUuuuse me. I'll rephrase for the supposed masses.If you enjoy eating hot dogs, you'll want to make D's a destination when hanging in the 'burgh. It's a great place to go and get some tubed meat in a variety of different mix and match combinations and also a great place to meet new people... perhaps you'll even meet someone who shares your love of you eating hot dogs and you can shower them with many moments of which they can watch you eat your beloved wieners and y'all can live happily ever after. No? Ugh, fine. Then just eat the damn hot dog all by your lonesome. See if I care.I came in with a group of friends for a semi-liquid lunch and though it was the beer cave that brought us in, I was secretly more excited about watching my friends eat hot dogs. You see, I'd been feeling super sick for the entire duration on my Pittsburgh road trip. I think it was a bad Cholera strain. Anyway, my party of six allowed me to sleep in extra late while they wandered around some graveyard by our hotel with scones until I was all puked out and ready see what the light of day looks like. I was feeling bummed that I had to hibernate through my original morning plan of going to the zoo, but the thought getting to see my pals suck down chili dogs all Jack & Diane style really helped lift my spirits.We walked in, sat down and I was immediately excited to be sitting across from their epic celebrity mural. It's like a pop-culture/history 'Where's Waldo', only there's no Waldo, and instead Gandalf, Wolverine, John Candy, and more. I spent the entire time between ordering and the food coming out staring at the wall and finding new peeps. My only gripe on the artwork is that the mural was seriously lacking in Bill Murray biz-nasty, so for that I have to subtract a star. Okay, no. I'm only (half) joking about the star thing. I'm actually deducting the star because their veggie dog was pretty damn terrible. I mean, the toppings (I got the chihuahua with cheese and jalapenos) were fine, but I think I've microwaved dogs that tasted better than theirs. It was so freaking rubbery and tough and chewy... like bad calamari or trying to chew a whole pack of rock hard Bazooka Joe at once. My jaw was tired from trying to force my tearing teeth into that little soy sausage but the worst part is that I had to devote so much extra time to eating my stupid wiener that I missed being able to watch my friends eat their hot dogs. Boo-urns. Next time, I'll skip the veggie dog and go with a wrap or pizza or burger or something that'll allow for more wiener-peeping.On the other hand, the veggie pub fries were damn good and something I resented having to offer to share them with my friends... but I did offer because I felt like it would detract from them getting 'weirded out' at my wanting to gawk at them like I bought a ticket to watch them eat hot dogs... even though that wishful thought didn't pan out anyway thanks to the lackluster veg-dog I ended up with. Their beer selection was stellar and their beer cave in back was a fun shopping experience and great place to find a few rarities. They actually had the Rogue Voodoo Doughnut bombers that you can hardly ever find. Unfortunately, my sickness impaired me from imbibing and I actually spent the latter half of the time there barfing in the bathroom (not to the fault of D's) while my friends shopped for a bevy of beer in the cave. Also worth mentioning is how friendly everyone here was. Lots of helpful staff members and even the other ladies in the bathroom who were concerned with my hurling to the point where they wouldn't leave me alone and I had to lie and say that it was no big deal, I was in my first trimester and the morning sickness was getting the best of me. Very nice people those Pittsburgh folk are.CM and I visited D's yesterday (Sat.) at around 7pm for dinner.  Given that CM lives right around the corner, and that I had a City Dining Card, D's had been on our list for awhile, and we were eager to check it out. We happened to arrive right when the Kentucky Derby was in full swing, and there wasn't a table to be had, so we gave our name to the hostess to be texted when a table became available (Note: D's uses NoWait).  Fortunately, we arrived right at the end of the derby, so several tables soon cleared out, and we received the text within 10 min., despite an estimated wait of 15 min.Once we were seated at one of the high tops next to the mural, we perused the menu to decide what to order.  Because I don't eat beef, I decided to go with the turkey dog ($5.50), style of the month for May (topped with pierogies, onions, and sour cream), as well as a veggie dog ($5.50), Angry Tiki style (topped with bacon, pineapple, hoisin sauce, and spicy cheese sauce).  CM decided to go with the bratwurst dog ($6.50), Mason Dixon style (topped with chili and coleslaw) on a wheat bun (+$.50) and a turkey dog, Big Ben style (topped with fries, cheese wiz, and cole slaw).  In addition to the dogs, we ordered a large order of fries, pub style ($8).The fries were brought out first, per our request, so that we could munch on them.  I'm pretty sure they were the largest order of fries I've ever received--they would have solved the Irish potato famine in a jiffy!  They came drenched in cheese wiz and generously sprinkled with real bacon bits (not Bac-Os!), with a sizeable cup of ranch dressing on the side, which we promptly poured on, as well (yeah!).  Despite all the dressings, the fries were pleasantly crispy, due to being of the battered variety.  However, over the course of our meal, they became progressively more soggy, due to the dressings soaking into them.  Between the two of us, we finished about 2/3 of them--not too shabby, esp. for people of our size!As for the dogs, to my surprise, I was more of a fan of the Angry Tiki than the pierogi dog of the month.  When it comes to the dogs themselves, I preferred the turkey dog to the veggie dog, which I found bland.  However, the toppings of the Angry Tiki dog were so flavorful that they masked the blandness of the veggie dog, which was only detectable when I bit into it alone.  Although I thought the turkey dog itself was more flavorful, I wasn't impressed as much by the toppings, which consisted of what were no doubt Mrs. T's pierogies and too many grilled onions for my taste (I removed many of them).  CM preferred the turkey dog to the bratwurst dog, and the Big Ben to the Mason Dixon style slightly, but enjoyed both styles.The service at D's was friendly and efficient--our orders were placed and fulfilled promptly and with a smile.  During the short time that we waited for our food, CM and I enjoyed examining the mural, which contains many real life and fictitious characters, and the monk decorations on the other wall.  Although we didn't order any beer, we checked out the beer cave before leaving, and were quite impressed with the selection--now CM has a neighborhood go-to spot the next time he needs to bring a six pack to a party!  With the City Dining Card, our total came to $23, which I felt was quite reasonable for the amount and quality of food received. In sum, we were very pleased with our experience at D's, and would definitely return, esp. in light of the proximity to CM's residence and the extensive beer selection.
Sophie's French Bistro=Amazing!  From start to finish this place was incredible.  Great french host (Mgr?).   Great french waiter, helpful and funny.   The support staff was way above average always, plates cleared and drinks filled in a timely manner. I REALLY like the fact they don't rush you and try to flip tables, we were there about two hours. This is a quaint little stand alone restaurant that also has a small bar and a few tables out on the patio.  I'll be back soon just to visit these areas.   We started with a nice bottle of french wine.For the appetizer:Brie en CrouteCreamy Brie coated with toasted almond slivers andwrapped in puff pastry, then baked, served with toastedbaguettes and port reduction The main courses:Poitrine de Porc ProvencalePan roasted pork tenderloin crusted with herbs d'provenceand served with sweet corn and goat cheese polenta fritters,sauteed pea tendrils with grape tomatoes and leek fondueAnd...Coquille Saint-Jacques a la SophiePan seared Sea Scallops served over sauteed ricotta gnocchiwith a citrus and shaved fennel baby arugula saladfinished with tarragon beurre blancFor Desert:Raspberry BruleeChambord soaked fresh raspberryinfused in vanilla creme brulee----- I need to get creative and come up with more birthday's, anniversary's, holidays, or some other random reason to splurge on a place like this more often.Dottsy Z. and I met here last week to try their new happy hour and we had an amazing time! The weather was perfect, the patio beautiful, and the company was amazing.Their happy hour menu featured a nice variety of white and red wines, all for $6, plus we tried the escargot, pate, and frites as well. We spoke to chef, who was very knowledgeable and able to accommodate gluten free items, especially if you call a day or two in advance. We topped off the night with a decadent creme brulee and imported cocoa dusted truffles, which capped off the evening on a perfect note.4.5 starsI had my first date with Jessica F here! It was supposed to be a big group (yeah you FLAKES) but it ended up being just her and I and we were treated like ROYALTY!Let me get some disclosure out of the way: Thomas was our server, and he is also a friend of mine. That being said, he was professional and courteous. He definitely had his "Top Notch Waiter" hat on that night. You probably wouldn't have been able to tell we are friends.We indulged in some of the wine specials for their happy hour. Each glass I had was only $6. We decided to try the escargot (nice and garlicky), the pate (delicious) and the frites (they were frites). The main event of the night for me was the Beef Bourguignon. Omigosh, friends! I dream of this dish to this very moment. The beef was perfectly cooked and the burgundy sauce was FANTASTIC. WHEW! Did it just get warm in here? I was so full and happy after that amazing meal!I will most certainly return to Sophie's in the hopes of giving them the 5 stars I'm sure they deserve!Food poisoning for two, please...I am really confused by all the 4-star and 5-star reviews for this place. The 4-star average Yelp rating was the reason my wife and I chose to dine here during our stay in Phoenix. Yelp, you really let us down this time.So I was on company business travel in Phoenix the week of March 12th and my wife was traveling with me. We had a French impulse that Tuesday night and tried to crash Petite Maison in Scottsdale, only to find out that reservations were required and there were no tables available. The following night, still craving French cuisine, we decided to stop in at Sophie's French Bistro in Phoenix.The first warning sign was that the place was entirely empty during peak dinner hours. However, encouraged by the strong reviews on Yelp, we decided to go ahead and order. We took advantage of a couple of happy hour specials and ordered the following...3 Cheese PlateChef's PateCalamariCrispy Duck BreastCreme BruleeThe food was average at best. My wife and I both tend to critique food as we eat it, and we both found ourselves commenting that the portions were small and the food was overpriced for what it was. Most of what we ate was bland and the pate had a very odd flavor and consistency.The fun started about 4 hours later when we were back in our hotel room. We both started experiencing various internal moaning and groaning, followed by the onset of stomach pain. No big deal, I thought... By shortly after midnight, we were each fighting for time in the bathroom, taking turns to vomit up everything we had eaten that night. I'll try to spare you the details, but this was the kind of violent and uncontrollable vomiting that I have only experienced perhaps once before in my entire life. Needless to say, diarrhea was also involved.After going through this for a good two hours, my wife and I were both thoroughly exhausted and dehydrated. My wife even told me she felt like she was dying, and said that she had never felt this bad before - not even during child birth. o.OSo by around 2:30am, my wife was begging for me to call an ambulance. For a while, neither of us could get up off the floor to reach the telephone. I eventually found a break in the vomiting and managed to sip down enough water to recover slightly. I carried my wife out to the car and asked the hotel receptionist for directions to the nearest hospital.We drove to John C. Lincoln Hospital on Dunlap, which I recommend if you ever get poisoned by Sophie's French Bistro. I managed to get there without hitting anything, which was remarkable since I could barely see straight and could barely function at all. Once inside, my wife completely collapsed and was unconscious briefly. The nurses and doctors rushed her into the ER and brought her back around. They gave her a shot of morphine and then hooked her up to an IV drip of fluids. As I waited, I continued to experience vomiting and tried to keep myself hydrated. Despite being in a hospital, I was determined not to check myself in for treatment, not wanting to add further medical bills.Sometime around 5:00am, my wife was ready to be discharged. The official diagnosis was acute food poisoning. We were never able to identify the specific meal at Sophie's which poisoned us, as we both shared the same courses and ate equal amounts each.However - and this is the kicker - when the doctors asked us where we had eaten dinner and we told them it was Sophie's, they remarked "oh, that place!". We learned that the ER at John C. Lincoln has seen 3 other cases of food poisoning caused by Sophie's. The hospital took our information for the purpose of compiling a complaint against Sophie's with the AZ Department of Health Services. They told us that once they have at least 10 confirmed cases, then they are required by law to report the incident as a disease outbreak.This all would have been nice to know before we chose to dine at this place. I can only assume that the other poisoning victims either don't use the internet, or are still laying in a pool of vomit somewhere, too weak to write a review.Please, please, PLEASE don't put yourself through the same hell that we went through that night. After this experience, we lost all desire to dine in Phoenix ever again. Thanks, Sophie's, for ruining our trip.For the record, we did have an excellent meal at CIBO Pizza the night before we were poisoned. I highly recommend CIBO. Great food, without food poisoning.
Matt's Chicago Dog=Ahhhhhh. The neon green relish. The crisp, fresh pickle and tomato. The poppyseed bun. The real Vienna beef dog... well, it was a bit soft but in general the food here to me says west 35th, 55th off the Dan Ryan, or even 95th and Ewing if you know what I mean. They've got the lingo. Fresh cut fries, pizza puffs. Sadly the decor to me says something more like Fullerton and Clark. It's just a little too nice. I know that's a strange complaint. The tables and chairs look right, but that glass-and-brass sneezeguard and the tasteful mural... eh. Its just not tacky enough. I want to see posters of thick eyebrowed women holding up kronos gyros. I digress. Tasteful decor is not a dealbreaker though. I'm sure I'll be back.
Dexter's Pub=Just in case anyone was wondering... the Italian beef sandwich and hot wings are just as tasty when you take them to go. You know... in case you needed that information. I crisped up the waffle fries in the oven when I got home, and it was like sitting there. But without the friendly faces and awesome tap line up.
Grinders Coffee Company=Just got in from a great evening at Grinders! Who knew you could hear amazing blues music for free -- in Sunnyslope of all places -- on the 2nd Saturday of each month!? I did, actually. The real question is why don't I go every month!?So, now I'm hopped up on a dirty chai latte and I must share the details about this neighborhood gem. Truly, the Valley's BEST neighborhood coffee shop! For a number of reasons...1.) Grinders is a place where everyone feels welcome from high school kids to retirees taking advantage of the free wi-fi.2.) They roast their OWN beans. That's right. They wheel a roaster out onto the same concrete slab that becomes the stage for Valley blues legends like Ronnie Whitehead on 2nd Saturdays and roast the beans for themselves!! I find their coffees to be pretty earthy and smooth. 3.) The fudgy pecan brownies are rich and chocolaty. The scones are biscuit-like and just the right amount of barely sweet. (I haven't tried the danish, but they look deadly!)4.) They are generous in sharing their own talents and promoting the talents of others, ensuring access to arts and culture. Each month, they allow a different local artist to show their work on the coffee shop walls. And while ordinarily they are not open past 6 p.m. on Saturday, an exception is made on the 2nd Saturday of each month when you can sit outside and listen to  live jazz and/or blues from 8 - 10 p.m.  And, by the way, Dennis, the owner, is a bad ass on the harmonica! We really are so lucky to have such a great business, doing great things, in the community!There are so many great things about Grinders!  Rotating Art from local artists (and not the ones trying their hardest to win the next hipster award), live music with great jazz bands, excellent coffee and tea reasonably priced. The fourth star is awarded for the pecan/cream cheese Danish thing the server recommended. It was so good I couldn't decide weather to scarf it down or savor each bite.
Sushi Kim Restaurant=Ew! Ew! Gross! I know that's not the most mature thing to say, but that's what comes to mind when I think about this place! Sad thing is, I've been here a couple times. Every time I kept thinking it would somehow get better, but no, it doesn't! The Miso soup they serve has this weird after taste, and to be honest, doesn't taste like any Miso soup I've EVER had! So on to the sushi, oh yeah, it's gross too! I think I kept going back because the size of the rolls are humongous. The thing is the fish does NOT taste fresh at all! It's always luke warm and....just.not.good. Oh well, I tried. But I'd suggest you not!
Athenian Express=So Dallas G and I were thinking of a lunch spot.  I suggested Cibo, Matt's, or Valley Pizza, and he thought of Focaccia Fiorentina.  I thought FF sucked the first time I went there but was willing to give it another try. But when we got there ol' Dally had a "better" idea and suggested Athenian Express.As we pulled in, some unacceptably angry looking woman glared at him for a reason that will presumably remain unknown to us.  (Please enjoy my multimedia Yelp.)http://twitter.com/spirit_fingers/status/5209414090In retrospect, I think she was our guardian angel trying to scare us off.  Inside, the place looks quaintly divey.  I asked if anything was so much better than the gyro that I should get it instead, and was told that the gyro is the way to go.  Feta or no feta?  I wondered if it was an avalanche of feta or just a sprinkling.  He puts a lot on there.  Fine, no feta.  I get the potato salad with it, and an order of spanakopita--which I ordinarily love.We sit outside.  The spanakopita arrives.  It has little cheese and is not flaky.  Tastes kinda like shit.  Served with crappy tzatziki, which I don't think is the appropriate side for spanakopita but whatevs.http://twitter.com/spirit_fingers/status/5209643122Next, my gyro arrives.  The gyro meat is covered in three slabs of tomato and a mountain of onions.http://twitter.com/spirit_fingers/status/5209752658As you can see, at this point I'm fearing the worst.  Look, I like onions and all, but when you leave fresh onions out in the air for too long they become veeeerrrry rowdy.  Like so rowdy that eating one would be enough to burn your mouth and render you a pariah.  So all that's left of my gyro is three slices of "gyro meat" and tomatoes.  And the little side cup of tzatziki that is only filled a third of the way.  The gyro meat tastes like... nothing.  I am underwhelmed.I move on to my side of potato salad.http://twitter.com/spirit_fingers/status/5209805283Normally mustard potato salad has a pastelish yellow hue, but this one looked like it could be seen from space.  Whatever it was, it was odorless and flavorless, so I can only assume it's some undetectable poison like polonium-123.  If I die, I leave my rapier-like wit and boundless charisma to my son, Samir.  You all can fight over the rest.Anyway, the restaurant pretty much blew.http://twitter.com/spirit_fingers/status/5209947387I'm not an arsonist, it was a joke, relax.  But not as big of a joke as Athenian Express, which must have suffered a precipitous decline in quality if even Dallas G (and his notoriously low standards) ever liked it.Every day that Richard Z is in my hood, I play emotional Russian roulette with our lunch spot. Is he gonna hate it? Is he going to order the wrong item and blame me for the rest of the day? Should we go with the tried and true. Should we try a new locally owned small business gem and raise Phoenix out of the fiery ashes of its universal assessment as the smallest of the big cities? The guy's a real Nazi about his sustenance. So today, as we're walking to Focaccia Fiorintina, where we just should have gone to begin with, I'm like, "OH! Do you like gyros? Your last name is Greek. Let's go to Athenian Express!" Well, that was stupid. I really really really hate ripping on mom and pop shops. I hate giving two star reviews to family owned restaurants. But damn... You made me look like a REAL arsehole, Athenian Express. Poor Richard Z has been lamenting about how empty he feels all afternoon. And being the people pleaser that I am, well, I'm just devastated. The lady that took our order, no doubt a solid and very decent human being, was unwilling to play along with any banter whatsoever. For two extroverted numbskulls like us, it just takes a little bit away from the charm.And the spanikopita arrives... I find it too spinachy. He finds it too bready. Just goes to show you can't please everyone, or in this case anyone. My sandwich was literally inedible. Not because of the taste. I picked it up and the whole thing fell right apart. My tray looked like a murder scene. Ketchup, who for so long suffered as the understudy in this WAY off Broadway spectacle, played the part of my disappointment. When I asked @spirit_fingers about his meat, he said, and I quote, "It's not offensive." I remember liking this place in my past life. Today, it was not good.I'm a huge fan of Greek food.  I've been to Athens, and I loved it there.  And believe it or not, I like "express" aka fast casual restaurants where you order at the counter and they bring your food to the table.So, when I found myself downtown and hungry for lunch, heading over to Athenian Express was a no-brainer.  I can't say that I'll be rushing back, but it was fine... it delivered on what I was in the mood for on that day.Lunch pricing is super affordable and portions are large.  The Greek Salad was nothing special - I've definitely had better (but I've had worse too). **One key thing to note: I do not recommend adding chicken to your salad.  It's not the greatest quality chicken.  If you do go here, stick with the vegetarian options.
Original Pancake House=Located at Sharon Corners (behind Harper's/McD's) is some superfantastic breakfast eats!I had it in my head that OPH was going to be 1. expensive, because Southpark and 2. crazy crowded.  On a weeknight around 7:00, I was wrong on both counts.  Now, don't get it twisted - on the weekends, this place stays at full capacity, but the Tuesday dinner crowd was light, seemingly consisting of mostly regulars.  With a prime corner spot in the shopping center, parking is plentiful but the lot is crammed and the spots are on the narrow side (for those of us killing the planet in our SUV's).  I was warmly greeted when I entered and promptly seated.  My waiter came over immediately to get my drink order, came back a moment later and I was ready to order.  My food came out very quickly, and was smoking hot.My food:2 eggs over well - cooked perfectly.  Eggs were fresh and delicious.4 slices of turkey bacon - it seemed to be Butterball?  It tasted exactly like what I make at home, only it wasn't burned like I always manage to do.  3 pancakes - so good, so very very good.  Fluffy, not crazy sweet - with butter and some ample pours of the warm syrup, I could have eaten my body weight in these pancakes and I find myself craving them.The total for my meal, without tip, was $8 (I had water to drink).  The food was delicious, service was wonderful, the gentleman who seemed to be the boss that evening was very pleasant.  I will definitely return to OPH.
Rock Bottom=I must admit, I do like the brews.  I also like the white cheddar mash potatoes.  Other than that, meh.  The food is pretty forgettable.  Another "brewery" that sadly fails to be anything special in the food department.  With the restaurants upping the ante on 8th Ave, you may want to kick it up a notch Rock Bottom.  But how would anyone know to?  It's a chain.  Whomp whomp!If your in the market for a beer or two this could be an option. They have a nice seasonal selection and it's all tap which I prefer. I also like that most of the seating is booth. On my visit the service was lack luster. I have no idea where the waitress went for half the meal and her listening skills left much to be desired. I went with a beer sampler. It was nice being able to try everything they have. I of course went with the pumpkin beer. For my main dish I had stuffed peppers which I honestly enjoyed. They had a great flavor. My only issue is the rice that came with it was a bit under cooked. If service was better and my rice was cooked I would have given this place a solid 4 stars but that unfortunately wasn't the case on this particular visit.
Las Glorias Restaurant=Anyone who's been to South Phoenix knows that Mexican restaurants in that area are about as ubiquitous as bad drivers in Phoenix. My husband and I have lived in the area for 9 months or so but have always been a bit intimidated by just how much selection there is. To make matters worse, there aren't many Yelp reviews of places around here, so we keep feeling like any choice we make is uninformed. (Whatever did we do before Yelp?!) One night, we decided to drive down Central and look for the restaurant that was the most crowded with locals. (Naturally, Poncho's was crowded but we have been there before and find it good but not particularly authentic). Las Glorias--a white and blue building with fish painted on it--was packed, so we made a mental note and decided to return. We came back on New Year's Day when it was decidedly less crowded but the food did not disappoint. In fact, it was downright delicious and this place is definitely our new local favorite. As you can see from the pictures, this place is even more themed inside. There is kitschy nautical decor everywhere--my personal favorite is the lighthouse on the wall that lights up. This place could be covered in real barnacles, though, and I wouldn't care. The food was just that good. To start with, the tortilla chips were hot and fresh out of the oven and the salsa was perfect with the perfect consistency and flavor. For our entrees, I got the Camarones Culichi ($12.50), and my husband got the Camarón y Filete Empanizado ($12.50), which is essentially breaded fish and shrimp served with rice, beans and salad. My shrimp were the freshest I've had in Phoenix with a sweet flavor and firm texture and the culichi sauce (a spicy green chili cheese sauce) was creamy but spicy at the same time. Even when I had finished the shrimp, I found myself dipping chips into the sauce. Can't let something that good go to waste! My husband's fish and shrimp were also excellent, with a slightly spicy and crunchy breading. They were even better dipped in one of the provided hot sauces (don't remember the name but it had a brownish color and tasted smoky). Our experience at Las Glorias was so great the first time that we decided to order to go from there recently. It's nice that they have a website with a menu since most local Mexican places do not. That time, we sampled the Camarones a la Diabla (again, great shrimp and kickin' flavor), the Crab Enchiladas w/ green sauce (incredible flavor and not too rich, but we could have gone without the few shell pieces we encountered), and the Ceviche Tostada (super fresh and perfectly spicy and a steal at only $3). You may have a local Mexican spot you love but there's something distinct and really wonderful about a seafood-only Mexican restaurant with eccentric decor and excellent fresh food. Venture on down Central (yes, south of downtown) and try it for yourself!Yelpers! You're letting me down here. Why has no one else reviewed Las Glorias yet? There are so many good reasons to go but I'll list a few:*It's only 10 minutes south of downtown. Yes, it's South Phoenix, but you'll go further for Los Dos Molinos and it's not even that great. *The people are incredibly nice. They don't speak any English so you'll have to order in Spanish, but they're always polite and smiling when I go in to eat or pick up. *The food is damn good. Fresh seafood options include incredible ceviche tostadas, mouthwatering Camarones Culichi, grilled fish in garlic sauce and more. *This place needs the support of more Yelpers to survive. It's weathered the last two years, but I'm always afraid they'll close their doors. And that would be a loss. Come on, give it a shot! If you don't want to eat in, you can order to go. We've done it many times and the food is always great to have in front of the TV with beer.
Rusty Nail=The Rusty Nail is a neighborhood diner-style restaurant that serves Pittsburgh-centric comfort foods.  Meatloaf, pasta, and hot roast beef all grace the menu.I came here with my dad who ordered a hot roast beef, and I ordered a bowl of spaghetti and meatballs.  Both meals were right around $10 and delicious.  The portions were huge, and the waitstaff was very friendly.I'm guessing it was the owner, but a nice guy came around asking everyone how their food was and making small talk.  Nice touch.
Duck & Decanter=Duck and Decanter is surprisingly uninspired food.  I wouldn't recommend this as a meal for a downtown diner unless your choices are down to this and Quizno's.  My prosciutto sandwich was dreadfully boring, equal to something you'd probably get in a nice, fancypants hospital like the Mayo Clinic.  There, it would be awesome, but here, as a downtown staple is not noteworthy whatsoever.So as often as I go and as much as I enjoy this place I decided to update my review.  This is absolutely my favorite spot downtown for a sandwich.  Sure you can get Subway or Jimmy Johns for cheaper (not by much) but here you get QUALITY.  Their menu selections has something for just about anyone (they now started carrying gluten free bread) , sandwiches, soups, salads and pastries.  They also have a convenient online ordering system so you can place your order and pick up when you are ready.  Their sandwiches are fresh made to order with exactly what you want.  Try one of their signature sandwiches, YUM! Or keep it simple...it's your choice. If you are not that hungry they offer a mini version of most sandwiches (using one slice of bread but super generous fillings)  I personally prefer to keep it simple, generally going for one of the following, ham sandwich on dark rye with everything, egg salad on dark rye (no cheese) with everything or peanut butter (house made) with honey on whole grain. They offer a variety of beverages including beer, wine and fresh brewed iced tea. You can feed your sweet tooth here with a variety of pastries or select candies they offer.  A happy hour is offered in the evenings, sometimes with live music.  The service is quick , friendly and the ingredients fresh.  Crisp leaf lettuce and tomato on your sandwich are not treated as an afterthought here.  They take pride in their quality and presentation.  Skip the big chains across the street and shop this local AZ business.*Thumbs up* This place is has some really good sandwiches, more specifically the Duckling. Ofcourse you will taste the roasted duck in it, but what I'm pointing out here is that the flavor and goodness of this sandwich is truly amazing. It really hits the spot! Oh yeah, the coffee here is great too. Service was okay so it was all fine.I go back and forth about this place. On one hand, there are some really great things. I love building my own sandwich at Duck and Decanter because they have so many great things to spruce up your order. You can add so many extras to your sandwich to make it delicious. Russian mustard, plump juicy avocados, turkey salad with blue cheese, sharp cheddar spread? Yes, please! They also have great fresh brewed iced tea every day in a variety of unusual flavors. I'm an unsweetened iced tea junkie so I love this.On the other hand it takes a really long time to get your food and sometimes it tastes so blah despite putting a crapload of extras and sauces on it. Then it costs like $10 because you had to add all the extras for flavor. Shouldn't flavor come free?I think it should.Two words- Smokey Forest.It must be me or I just never order the right thing, not sure. Everyone I know that has ever mentioned the Duck tells me they like it. Yes I have been several times over the years. But a few days ago I was at our office which is on 7th ave just south of Thomas. I was really hungry and wanted something to eat, this in it self is kind of unusual as I can more than likely wait until the end of the day before I have to eat. Plus the fact I have enough fat on me to last a few months I would not be starving to death any time soon if I missed a meal or three. So I asked Bruce, you remember Bruce he is the guy I am always asking things when down at the office. I wanted something delivered as I wanted to stay in the office to get a contract ready for signing. The only place he could think of was the Duck, but he said he could go and get it much faster. So I said ok and gave him my card and told him to get what he wants and order me I think it is called the Ducky or something like that.  Man he was back much more quickly than I had expected him to be, so they must have been on the ball in making the food. But the food as I always find; just nondescript. NO discernable flavour just a mish mash of textures and blandness. So I can say I like the building, the quickness they have gotten my food out and the patio. I guess the folks are also nice, but do not remember them so they were not not nice. I just do not get the praise this place gets, I find much better food for less elsewhere. But hey it might just be me since I am of the minority on this subject.I must say I can't believe I have not yet written a review on The Duck yet. As literally one of my favorite places in town one would think it would be at the top of my to do list. Maybe it is my secret desire to keep it a secret, as best as I can, so that it does not turn into a zoo everyday and I can't get my yummy sammies. It is also extremely surprising to me that some have gone to lengths of posting a negative review of The Duck. It seems that in those cases they are wanting The Duck to be something it's clearly not; a mainstream-mass production-delivary running-squeeky clean-just-like-every-there kinda place. If that's what you are looking for then I would suggest going to AJ's, they might be a better fit for you.Duck and Decanter has been around for longer than I have been around. They have won award after award for the best sandwich in town. I am surprised Kanye hasn't busted in on a subway commercial and told Jared that he would let him finish, but Duck and Decanter has the best stuff EVER! It has a homey feel, that makes you almost say (as Jeff L. put it) "Am I still in Phoenix?" They have daily soups and special sandwiches. Their cheese is out of this world, the best provolone I have ever had for sure. They slice all their meat in house and very thin, perfect! I would tell you what sammy is my favorite, but that list would go on way too long. Turkey on a croissant, bree with roasted red peppers and prosciutto, garlic chicken salad, BLT.... The Duck is the perfect spot to have lunch out on the patio on a sunny Saturday or Sunday. They have a musician playing music most of the time and sometimes even have cute little farmers markets and art fests. It is perfectly tucked back in the shopping center with Sports Authority shielding you from the hustle and bustle. There is a fun grass area for pets and children to run around on. They also have some great knickknack shopping available to pa-ruse while you wait for your food. They have all kinds of coffee, tea, dishware, cookware, marinades, candy, drinks, wind chimes, magnets, jewelry, specialty gifts, and so on and so on. You can also call ahead and reorder to avoid the sometimes very long line. Have fun!I've never seen a real duck at this Decanter, but I'm pretty sure that if they knew what a great little treat this local business is, they'd be lining up and quaking to be let in. Duck and Decanter is an adorable little local deli, wine bar and gift shop in Phoenix. With a perfect patio to enjoy lunch on a nice day and a gift shop with unique finds to browse through while you wait for your sandwich, it's an enjoyable experience all around. The food here is freshly made and up to gourmet par. They have a selection of cheeses to satisfy any dairy like and the wine is equivalently nice. I like to visit the Duck when I want a quality lunch and need it in a short period of time. My go-to sandwich is the ham and brie with honey mustard. It's a big sandwich too so I always have a left-over afternoon snack. They have a huge selection of drinks and chips -- including baked lays and for the times when my sweet tooth takes over, they have a variety of brownies, cookies and candy as well. I always enjoy browsing through the gift shop and it's a perfect stop if looking for a unique gift that's off the beaten path. Duck also supports local AZ so they have several events throughout the year with local businesses and promote other local happenings around town. The wine bar is intimate and full of spectacular vinos. I always forget about the wine bar and need to remember to visit more often. All in all, Duck and Decanter is a true treat for my taste buds every time I visit. If you're in a hurry, call ahead and place an order to pick up because it can get pretty busy during lunch time. They also deliver!I dig the Duck.  I don't even really know what to call it.  Part store, part bar, part deli, part someone's living room who doesn't make you feel guilty about not helping with the dishes, only catch being you actually have to pay for your wine and cheese (which I'm totally fine with if it means I don't feel guilty for not helping with the dishes).Basically the duck has everything you could possibly need dispersed at different locations around what appears to be a large cabin with a lush green park in front.  You get your items (wine, coffee, sandwiches, whatever) and you mosey around, find a place to sit and enjoy them, just like you would in your own backyard, except your own backyard probably doesn't have as extensive of a wine collection or an award winning cheese department (and if it does, I officially hate you).I like to come here for happy hour (M-F, til 7:00, $2 off house wine and draft beer) or on Sunday afternoons to do a little daydrinking and people watching.  I don't have kids or a dog, but people that do seem to love this place.  Normally I don't prefer my wine with children (probably why I don't have kids), but the Duck's overall mellow environment somehow soothes me to the point that I find myself actually enjoying the presence of the mini-humans. And if I enjoy anywhere enough to actually consider motherhood, it's probably worth at least a dozen or so stars, but Yelp only goes up to five so five it is.Duck & Decanter is my go to spot for supreme sandwiches, so dang tasty!I cannot testify for the entire menu, I have 2 favorites that I keep going between. But I can attest to how delish their coconut macaroons are, they are soft, moist and sweet, perfectly cooked on the outside and soft and tender on the inside. Also they carry Fairytale Brownies, and I know those are bomb! My 2 favorite sandwiches right now are the Vermont Treat & Sonoran Chicken.  The Sonoran Chicken has a spicy oil & vinegar sauce like and has jicama, bell peppers, cilantro, corn and green onions with chicken all mixed together and I always pick to have it on ciabatta bread with Swiss cheese, tomatoes and some lettuce, omg this is such a great sandwich! So good I crave it at times! The Vermont is a maple glazed ham sandwich with pine nuts, spinach, sliced apples and cheddar cheese, omg this is heaven on bread!  The blend of the ham cheese and apples are amazing, beautiful flavors happening their!This location is pretty sweet too, there is seating upstairs as well as downstairs, and on the weekends there is live music out in the patio area. And there is a even a beer & wine garden and a cozy fireplace too!Yep this Duck & Decanter is becoming a favorite of mine. I'm sure I'll be back in no time.
MacAlpine's Soda Fountain=Mac Alpine's is an Original Soda Fountain.  Pretty sure it's the only one left in the city.  When you walk in you can sit on one of the stools at the original bar and one of the lovely folks there will make the drink or ice cream desert of your dream.  A fizz, an egg cream, a malt or even a simple Dr Pepper float.  You name it, they can make it.  The ice cream deserts rock in their simplicity.  There are some very cool original booths still left, and some extra seating in the back.  It's not a huge place by any means, but I've never had to wait for a table - even when they were a stop on the First Friday bus route.  Folks who came by acted like they were in a museum - just looking at all the cool stuff - some of which is for sale - and left.  They have NO idea what they were missing out on here.  The ONLY thing that makes the place not get 5 stars is that they don't offer french fries.  Their burgers are awesome - but without the fries, I stick more to their amazing BLT or their messy but good good egg salad.  Both of those go great with their potato salad - which I think is one of the best ever.  The absolute best part?  We had 2 meals, 2 flavored drinks and 2 deserts and it cost less than $25.  Bam baby.Have you ever watched those dumb/boring/nerdy space documentaries that tell you lies regarding the impossibility of time travel? Some dude with a talking computer tells you "...currently, there is no way to deviate from the space-time continuum"... Lies! I'll tell you how to do it.  You don't even need to buy a time machine on eBay like Kip Dynamite. Just get into your car (no, it doesn't have to be a Delorian) and drive to 7th Ave and Thomas Rd (just south of Thomas on the E side), and BAM! You, my friend have entered another dimension.You walk into this place and you expect to see Cowboy Biff sitting at the bar. Unfortunately, all you see is elderlies shuffling about. Well, they must know something that we all don't. Like an old man/woman secret that they only tell their peers. You, my friend, have just learned their secret! Sit down and order yourself a Black Bean Burger. What? You say you don't like vegetarian food? Well, neither do I! Trust me. Do it!While you wait, you can imagine you are your grandpa at 12 years old. Just stopping into the local soda fountain shop to get a smooth refreshing malt. Being a 12 year old in the 1930s, you notice how modern and sleek the decor is in here. Ice cream adverts everywhere... Makes you want to stay 12 forever."Mom, can I have some ice cream?" Oh, I mean "Sorry, can I get a strawberry malt with that Black Bean Burger? Ahem, thanks..."Who puts celery in chili?No french fries?Carrot and raisin salad on the menu?Cute old-fashioned decor, but really I just wanted to dust the place.This was my third time and probably last . The service was terrible. No particular server assigned so therefore no one to check on us. Our dirty dishes from lunch were still on the table when ice cream soda dessert arrived. I guess management did not anticipate being busy the Sunday during memorial weekend.I love Macalpines it's in my neighborhoodI get the whole vibe .With that being said They need to get a touch realistic they are becoming over priced its Thrifty ice cream Not Ben and Jerry's I'm not complaining But when a Sandwich ice tea and a Ice cream is costing $17.50  then $21.00 withTip I  think it's a little too much ..., just saying
Harris Grill=Might I say that this is one of the best places in Pittsburgh to get a late night bite and brew?  Yes, I might and will say this.After a frustratingly long day during a frustratingly long week at work, I decided I needed to stop here and ease my nerves with some comfort food and try out a few brews.  This, my friends, is just what the doctor ordered (no pun intended in relation to my work).My friend had beat me there and already had one of each in front of her.  She decided on the Trailerpark Tatchos and I'm not quite sure what she had to drink, but it was interesting in an interesting glass.  The Tatchos were amazing.  Nothing more than nacho toppings on tater tots, but a brilliant idea none the less.  The mixture of tastes on the fried up tater tots was great.  In a single bite you got spicy, hot and cool.  I decided that I needed to order something else myself, as I feared that my friend might end up raising her lip and snarling at me for eating more than I should.  I got myself an order of Cloudy and a Chance of These.  I dare you to take a wild guess as to what this order pertained to.   DING DING DING...you, sir get a prize...not really.  Nothing but an order of meatballs swimming in a big huge potion of their sauce.  Served with a side of bread to sop up what the fork missed.  The right combination of spices mixed with the melted cheese on top was what did it for me.  And that bread made sure I didn't miss a smear of that sauce.As for the brews, I tasted three different ones while I was here.  It was kind of hard to choose, but their nifty little binder filled with the choices made it easier.  What also made it easier was the fact that our waitress was able to make suggestions, not just guesses like most places.  Different flavors hitting my palate at just the right time made for a great night here.  I will definitely keep this on my short list when I need to calm myself after a hectic day at work.It's time for an update, as promised, since I revisited Harris Grill the weekend before last.  This time, I came with CM and a friend of his for dinner, instead of late night drinks and snacks.  Although we came at prime time (around 7:00pm on a Sat.), unlike my last visit, it wasn't crowded at all, which was probably due to the snowy/cold weather.  This time, instead of being seated at one of the cramped tables next to the staircase, we were seated at a prime corner table upstairs with a great view of Ellsworth Ave.  Between these factors, our visit was off to a good start.After perusing the menu, I decided to go with the pork shank special ($17), and CM ordered the jerk chicken tacos ($12).  Additionally, as promised, I ordered the large mac and cheese again to split, to which we decided to add bacon ($13).  CM's friend went with the turkey burger ($9), which came with fries.  Upon being served, my pork shank entree looked quite impressive, impaled with a knife and surrounded by steamed veggies and some mashed potatoes.  When I tried it, however, it tasted like something from a chain restaurant--meaning that while it wasn't bad, it wasn't particularly special, either.  I didn't try CM's jerk chicken tacos, but he seemed to enjoy them, and I didn't ask his friend what he thought of the turkey burger, so I can't offer an opinion on those items.As for the mac and cheese, this version was better than the version I'd had previously.  This time, it had an acceptable amount of cheese (although it would have been improved by even more...), and the bacon added some savory depth to the flavor.  As before, it came sprinkled with bread crumbs underneath the bacon, which gave it some extra crunch (as mentioned previously, I enjoy bread crumbs on my macaroni).  However, some of the noodles were a bit burnt (see photo)--perhaps this was due to toasting the bacon and bread crumbs on top?  Overall, while this was an improvement over the prior version of this dish I had here, it was only okay to good, failing to crack the top echelon of PGH mac and cheeses (score: 7.0/10).Service was about what I'd expect for a place like this--not super attentive, but there when we needed it.  The check for CM and I came to around $50, which seemed steep for the quality of the food received.  Fortunately, I had a City Dining Card, which knocked off $10, but even so, with tip, we still almost cracked the $50 mark.  Taking everything into account, I'd be willing to return for Happy Hour or Bacon Night, but I doubt I'd return for (regular priced) dinner, since the quality:price ratio was lower than I'd like, and there are many other options in the area. 3.5 stars.I love Mac and cheese.  After seeing the pictures of a variety of mac and cheese options, I knew I needed to test out Harris Grill.I came in with two friends a few days ago.  My friend and I split the "I Can Has Bacon Cheezeburger" and an order of Mac and Cheese.  The total for this was about $12.50 with tax each. The burger was good but not special.  There was more bacon on the burger than most places, but it was not the star of the meal.  The mac and cheese, however, was fantastic.  The portion was quite large, and our awesome waiter brought us some Sriracha, which was a great addition!  There was lots of rich cheese sauce, which was extra yummy on our french fries.  This is one of the top mac and cheeses I have had in Pittsburgh.The place is a bit dark, and even on a Wednesday night, most people were already toasted at 6 PM.  The witty menu is fun to read while waiting for food as well.Parking can be challenging on Ellsworth so be prepared to walk a bit.
TEXAZ Grill=I heart (attack) Texaz Grill. My tummy (arteries) were filled with good ole, down home cooking. My NY strip was perfection and dripping with flavor (cholesterol). Rickie's a Texas boy so he knows his chicken fried anythings, and his chicken fried chicken was smothered in love (gravy) and he nibbled every bite (inhaled like there's no tomorrow). I chased my taters, sauteed shrooms and steak down with a cold Dos XX and a Patron shot. All this with attentive and friendly service. The room reminded me of the shack Steve Martin lived in, in the beginning of The Jerk. And for this place, the license plates, posters and bric a brac that cover every corner, including the ceiling above the urinal, yes, guys get this...when you have to pee so badly, you arch your  head back with an eye rolling groan...that's how I saw the posters on the ceiling. But all the kitchy crap everywhere works for Texaz Grill. The menu has all kinds of steaks and wonderful sides. The only thing missing is a defibrillator.First time back in a couple years...This place serves the best Chicken Fried Steak in Phoenix! The staff are friendly, fast, and knowledgeable. Menu is simple and to the point. The memorabilia from Texas and Arizona should be in a museum. The prices are very reasonable! In fact, next time we are going to split one order. The "bigger than the plate" (and the plate was huge) CFS is only $12 and that includes a salad, bread, and fries...Damn, I need to get here more often!So it has been a little over a year since I was here last. The place still holds a 5 star review from me. I tried the CFS and it WAS good. I never really cares for CFS but figured if I was going to like it I should get it from the best. It is a 7inch plus slab of tender beef, lightly battered in a airy type of batter. Think of soda water infused batter. They then slather the middle with a creamy and yummy white gravy. They serve it with mashed and corn with a biscuit on the side. The corn was cold, the mashed were OK and the biscuit was just OK. The price for lunch was $7.99 of something really reasonable. The Chef salad with chicken looked killer.TexAZ Grill is a low key hidden gem in Phoenix.  It's location is modest, its decor is eccentric, very Texan inspired, and the size of the restaurant is fairly small.  The portions however are not so small.  I went for Brunch and of course I had to try the chicken fried steak everyone raves about. I was not disappointed in the CFS, just as the man other yelpers state, it is Indeed very good. Not made of the usual ground beef type of meat, it was more of an actual deep fried thinly pound steak.  What also came as a surprise, was how much I enjoyed the side dishes. The gravy was amazing, as were the biscuits and if your thirsty, may I suggest the Turlingua Sunrise. I cannot wait to come back and try a big juicy steak. God bless Texas!Nope, nope, nope.I came here on the recommendation of other fellow Yelpers and I am so disappointed.Firstly, parking is a mess.  Next, I came with my husband and two year old daughter and the hostess told me that they don't have a high chair that can accommodate a two year old so she had to use a booster seat.  The problem is that she's at that middle age where she's almost done with high chairs and still too immature for a booster seat.  What a mess trying to keep her in her booster seat and contained.  She wasn't noisy or badly behaved, per se, she just wanted to stand up in the booth and look around and fidget with all the condiment bottles on the table.  Also, can I mention that the booths have a weird half wall that obscures the other diners from the chest up, but is open from the chest level down, so someone in the other booth could easily reach underneath the wall and dig around in your purse if they wanted to, or your two year old can peek underneath the booth wall to play peek-a-boo with the diners on the other side?  It's pretty weird.So the waitress came over took our drink orders with a minimum of small talk (or overall friendliness).  We perused the menus.  My husband chose a beef brisket sandwich.  I wanted a t-bone steak, I had been craving one and I was looking forward to it.  We ordered our dinners and it's worth mentioning that at NO point did the waitress acknowledge that presence of our daughter.  She never asked us what she wanted to eat or if she needed anything to drink either, apparently she was invisible.  Seeing as how there weren't any kids meals on the menu, I just assumed we'd feed her from our own plates, but interestingly the waitress just assumed that too because she didn't even ask if she'd be having a side order of something as her meal,  She just looked right past her.  If I sound pissed it's because I was.  I don't need the waitress to pinch her cheeks and make baby talk with her, but to merely acknowledge the fact that there were three human beings sitting at the booth that night would have been covered in 'Basic Manners 101'.So my steak was very flavorful and tender but BADLY undercooked, terribly fatty and a sickly color gray.  (It didn't have a nice sear or a good caramel color to it.)  I ordered it medium rare, but instead I got bloody, almost blue meat.  And there was so much fat that I only got about half meat, the rest was all scrap fat and the bone.  My sides were non-descript.  I think my mashed potatoes were probably decent, I honestly can't even remember that's how non-descript they were.  The roll and bread 'basket' that came with my food (one little roll and one little cold biscuit) were hard and tasted store bought.  And my hungry toddler didn't even want them.  My husband's beef brisket sandwich was a pathetic, dried out, flavorless waste of good money.  We didn't even bother with desserts.I had a margarita; it was very good, but beguilingly strong for how petite the rock glass is that it was served in.  After I finished it the waitress came around and asked me if I wanted another and I declined, but my husband (a non-drinker) immediately piped up and said "Yes, she'll have another!" and shot me a playful look, and rather than looking to me so see if I *really* wanted another $7 margarita or not she simply walked away and had the bartender make me another one!  WTF?  So within a couple of minutes I had yet another very, very strong margarita sitting in front of me.  Now I'm no cheapskate but I don't like to waste money so I choked down that second margarita and it was the proverbial 'straw that broke the camel's back'.  I may have finished it, but it definitely finished ME.  I spent the rest of the night stumbling and mumbling to myself about someone slipping me a mickey.  I've never, ever had a margarita that strong and I am a very well seasoned drinker.   What of Earth did they put in them??So to sum it up I spent over $60 (includes the tip) for 2 small Molotov cocktails disguised as margaritas, an undercooked, fatty, t-bone steak, an inedible, dry beef brisket sandwich and a big serving of NOTHING for my child.  Never again.The two stars are for the flavor and tenderness of the otherwise failure of a steak and the extreme value for your money on the alcohol.  THAT'S IT.Living in New York city for so many years I would chuckle over tourists. Just standing abruptly in utter fascination, usually in the middle of the sidewalk, blocking commutes in Times Square. In the office we would chalk it up to visual overload. So when I walked into TEXAZ Grill and behaved similarly I laughed at myself. Opening the doors to this restaurant was unbelievable. Memorabilia from the Great State of Texas. Covers. Every. Square. Inch.  Neon lights greeted me.  "Texas!" (Also neon shapes of Texas were everywhere.) An old school juke box. Beer signs galore. Guitars hanging. A giant gull head. Horns. John Wayne behind the bar. "Happy Birthday Texas!" The best collection of inappropriate stickers *ever*. License plates of every state covered the bar. The collection has been cultivated over 28 years by the the owner and patrons. (Tip: When you go, feel free to bring stuff in!)Anyhoo, stuff. My eyeballs were full. Finally I made it to the bar and met Tammy. (A hoot who has worked here 18 years!) After inquiring where I was from, a peppy response, "Well, welcome to Texas!" (And so I fell in love with this place. Before food even factored into the equation.)ENTREESSo the food... A tad concerned there wouldn't be a healthy option to consume I was incredibly wrong. (Plenty of non-fried options!) The ribeye steak was to die for. (Perhaps the mashed potatoes with gravy were necessary to consume. But I just had to try them!) The meat was prepared to the exact pinkness level requested. I can't even describe the level of food happiness that transpired that night. The meat was just so tender. I had made the mistake of noshing on the spicy hot peanuts available on the bar, as well as eating my way thru the delightfully prepared coleslaw that accompanied the meal.Amateur hour. Yes, definitely eat the coleslaw. It was flavorful and not too heavy in mayo. (Or try the salad with the blue cheese. Wonderful chunks of cheese.) But leave space for your meal!As I wasn't dining solo I had the opportunity to sample a burger. Holy bejeebers. This isn't a frou frou burger. This is a simply prepared burger, sans grease, on a beautiful bun with high quality meat. DESSERTWe earned a bread pudding! One second and I'll explain how. Tough decision as to what to pick but we went with the french bread in an egg custard with toasted pecans & raisins. Why? It was topped with a bourbon sauce! Dense and delicious. Served as described. Warm. Mmm mmm mmm! Biggest scoop of ice cream too!CLEAN PLATE CLUBClean you plate at lunch and get one punch. Two punches for dinner. EIGHT punches equals ONE dessert! How sweet is that? :)HHMon-Thur 3-6pm1/2 bottled beerWine by the glassAll well drinksAs they say there "It doesn't get any better kids!"We loved sitting at the bar for dinner! Great experience!I've always loved this place. Texas food is always good. I enjoy this place but just can't come here to often. TEXAZ is an unassuming place on the outside and settled in a very tight corner of the shopping center. Like I said very unassuming. Once you walk in then BOOM. It's like a time warp taking you back to Texas in the 1970's. Place is decorated with old pictures related to Texas, road signs, animal heads, caps, and old license places. Very interesting and very loud. Everyone talking, eating, and having a good time. We started out with our usual fries okra. This is the only place I can find fried okra in AZ. Nice change of pace. Love the okra. Nice and crisp. Love it. So I ordered their famous Chicken Fried Steak. They say it's the best in AZ and I can't disagree. All meals comes with a side salad. Salad doesn't look that appetizing but it's not bad. House dressing is pretty good. Anyways, the CFS comes with two huge pieces hanging off the plate smothered with gravy and comes with mash potatoes. Very crispy and fresh. Not greasy at all. Really good. Best in AZ hands down. Only problem is that it's too much food. I couldn't even come close to to finishing it. I saw two guys at a table across from us share an order of CFS. Very smart and would probably recommend sharing this huge meal. My wife ordered the Fried Catfish. Two large pieces of fish with a side of mash potatoes. Wife loved it. Not greasy at all. Fresh and moist but again a lot of food. So good. Everyone's ordering the CFS and fried catfish. There's a reason. My son ordered the prime rib regular cut. Really big piece of meat with a side of mash potatoes. My son really liked the prime rib. He's a fussy eater and he really like the prime rib. So when he likes it then I know it's really good. Looked juicy and fresh. We were stuffed with all this food. Packed up our leftovers but you can't leave this place without dessert. We shared the pecan pie. Oh my gosh. Your probably laughing right now but this is the best pecan pie. Had pecan pie from Texas and all over and this is the best I've had. It had a hard topping that most pecan pies don't have. A little chewy and not as sweet as most pecan pie. Crust is outstanding. Hands down yummy. So the food was really really good. The service was also outstanding. Once we sat down our server was there for our drink orders. Food was brought to our table really fast and they cleaned off our dirty dishes very quickly. We also had our server and owner check on us to make sure everything is okay. Everyone makes you feel at home just like in Texas. So good food (aka little too much), good service, and good dessert. Enjoy and bring a wheel barrow to roll you out. It's that good.
Jerusalem Middle Eastern Cuisine=The complaints I've heard about this restaurant are numerous, ranging from bad food to the infamous Soup-Nazi-like owner.  So why did I give it so many stars?  Many people would hesitate before eating at Jerusalem Restaurant, and I can't blame them if they have been spoiled by American restaurant standards.  In defense of these kinds of restaurants everywhere, I would argue that you have to be at least a little adventurous (and patient) when it comes to eating ethnic food.  I've become a regular customer because Jerusalem Restaurant is just so STRANGE, and kind of endearing in its own way.  I know that there are limitations to excusing poor service/attitude because of cultural differences, but I have never thought of the owner as malicious or incompetent.  Every visit, one of my friends makes an attempt to get the owner to smile (I've witnessed it, and it is a truly uplifting sight).Below, I've documented some of my observations while eating there.  I know that these are probably factors that cast the restaurant in a bad light, but personally, these are the type of experiences that have made me come to enjoy (at least for humor value) my visits to Jerusalem Restaurant.  Read on:* I first came into Jerusalem Restaurant with friends, and we all decided to order the daily combination plate.  When we got to the counter and placed our orders, the owner just asked each of us, "Meat or vegetable?"  We all requested meat, assuming that we would just receive whatever he was making for the daily meat dish.  To our confusion, when we received the meals, we each had been given a different meat: lamb, fish, and chicken!  (We learned later that you can just request a specific meat.)* I have struggled to decipher the numbering logic used at this restaurant; this is the first example.  When you look at the front counter, there are sheets of paper that show a condensed menu, just the most popular items served at lunch.  Instead of writing Combo #1, Combo #2, etc., their items are listed as #576, #708, etc. (not even in sequential order!).  * This is the second example involving weird numbers.  After you order, the owner will write a number on a piece of scrap paper and hand it to you.  This number is separate from the receipt, so it does not correspond to the price of your meal.  My friend and I thought it over, and we interpreted this as the same system employed at fast food restaurants, where your number is called when your order is ready.  When we looked, my number was 16 and my friend's was 28 (again, not sequential, even when he had ordered right after me).  Then, when our food was finished, the owner just waved at us instead of calling our numbers.  ...Huh?* Unlike most restaurants, the owner doesn't leave unlimited boxes of napkins at the silverware station or your table.  Instead, he leaves just a few napkins (less than 10) at the front counter, so you always feel bad about taking more than necessary.  Great economic/environmental tactic...?I'll briefly summarize a few more important points if you decide to try Jerusalem Restaurant:  (1) Order the spiced hot tea in the winter, (2) the restaurant is only open for lunch, not dinner, and (3) no matter how much you're initially intimidated by the owner, he is actually a warm person once you become familiar with him.
La Gondola Pizzeria & Restaurant=I stopped by La Gondola for a quick dinner about two weeks ago before seeing a show in the Cultural District.  I was curious as to how it would compare to the other nearby slice shop, Cafe Milano, which left me underwhelmed.  Ultimately, my assessment of La Gondola ended up being similar, but at least the owner was friendly and didn't aggressively upsell me.To get an idea of what their pizza is like, I ordered two slices--one of the thick crust Sicilian, and one of the thin crust regular ($2.50 each, I believe).  Additionally, I ordered a small side salad ($3.50).  The salad, while not anything too special, was enjoyable, esp. given the price--I especially enjoyed the generous topping of pizza cheese.  As for the slices, I could tell they were made fresh, based on the amount of time that they took to come out and seeing the owner ladling sauce on them before they went into the oven.  I have to agree with Chip's assessment here--they struck me as fairly average in quality.  While there was nothing wrong with them, per se, they just weren't very memorable.  I can't speak for the toppings, since both of my slices were plain (the thought of ordering a topping occurred to me too late), but a good pizza stands on its own.  While I guess $2.50 is relatively inexpensive downtown (esp. in Market Square, where the rent must be sky high), it's more than I'm used to paying for slices.On a positive note, the owner was very friendly, as I mentioned--there's always something to be said for service with a smile.  On the flip side, however, the furniture is looking pretty run down, with large visible tears in the upholstery, and could definitely use an overhaul.  Overall, not bad, but also probably not good enough to make me seek it out again, given the competitive downtown dining scene.  3.5 stars.
Harvey's Wineburger=So me and my buddy (coworker who is hourly) decide to go to lunch today.  What's the catch?  We don't know where to go.  We decided to go somewhere we haven't tried before that was off the beaten path. Enter Harvey's. Er, well, actually we did the entering.We get into the place and it is a narrow bar with a line of tables to the right. We sit. We wait.  Finally, after much gab, the Waitress/Bartender comes up to our tables and says 'Hi' then proceeds to stare at us.  Anticipating the usual question 'Can I start you guys off with something to drink'  I order an RC cola and my buddy does the same.  She recommends the Cheeseburger so thats what we get.  I also ordered a mixed basket because (FOR SOME STRANGE REASON) fries aren't included with the burger! THIS IS AMERICA PEOPLE!!!!!Along with the burger and fries, we got a lot of time to chat.  and I mean a LOT.  They sure are generous with time!!! Eventually, I ask her to put it in To Go containers and they give us the fries and cokes free.Also, just a side note.  Please eat your food before coming on to Yelp and reading reviews about the food you are eating.  Some of these reviews almost made me vomit... almost.I am a dive bar expert.  I love me a good dive bar.  The darker and older the better.  The surly regulars on the fringes of society are my people.This place is shit.  Not 'The Shit'.  Actual shit, as in a piece of crap.We ordered wings, after the bartender bragged how they were the best in town, and the regulars started laughing about how they just cooked a bunch of fish they caught locally in the frier, and that our wings were gonna taste fishy.  Not in a "we're fuckin' with you" way, but more of a "we have no sense of self" way.Homo say what!?!?They did taste fishy!  We each ate only one.  Everyone was having a great time about it.  We left an entire plate of uneaten wings, and nobody gave a shit.  Fine, no problem.  We finished our beers and left.Even if the wings weren't trouty, they were way too big.  Bigger isn't better in the case of wings.  They aren't actually buffalo wings, and shouldnt resemble some bloated and abused fictional beast.  They should be from chickens.  SMALL CREATURES CALLED CHICKENS.The end.I finally got around to coming here last night, and I really like it!  I knew what I was getting into because A) I've been to the original wineburger at 19th ave and Bethany Home already, B) I've read the reviews and C) I knew that these two places were originally started by a pair of brothers many years ago.Walking in, its a real divey type place.  Wood paneling on the walls, simple no frill tables and chairs, with limited decorations and dimly lit.  It's set up exactly like its sister location the original wineburger, with half of it being a bar with chairs and tables, and the other half being a pool and congregating area for those that want to do more then sit and hang on the bar.  I also saw a pinball machine, which was pretty cool as well.They have a few TV's hanging from the walls behind the bar with a variety of sporting events on for you to watch. Granted, I'm not a huge sports fan, but it's better then staring off into space or what not.  I sat at the bar, since I felt more comfortable there, and there wasn't to many people in here, so there was more then enough seating for me. I felt really comfortable here, and didn't feel like being around a million people anyways.They have great beer and alcohol specials during happy hour, and they have a decent menu of items to choose from. Prices are great, and the bartender here was really super cool.  Him and I chatted throughout my meal and I really enjoyed the conversation.  I went with the Jumbo Hot dog, and it was tasty...charbroiled and all, I really liked it here.If you want a low key night out, go check this place out. Divey, dark and not half bad. Will be back in the future. I think I like it here better then I did at the original one.It's a dive bar where they make "wineburgers" on a flat top behind the bar. It smells of cleaning products, stale beer and grease. It's nothing you don't expect and everything you would.
Spinato's Pizzeria=I like pizza, but it's always been hard to distinguish why I would choose one pizza over another. This pizza had good cheese...that pizza had good pizza crust....but what makes a pizza memorable? I still don't know the answer, but one example of a pizza that stands out is Spinato's. I discovered Spinato's cheesy goodness years ago. My sister asked me to pick up a pizza from this place called Spinato's on the way to her house, but actually...it wasn't even technically on the way to her house. Having never heard of Spinato's, I figured it was just going to be another average joe pizza experience. Then she told me what she ordered: sausage and pepperoni. Sausage? Really? But she swore by it which was random for her to swear by sausage so I went with it, thinking either she's gone off the rocker or this pizza might be something different. I had to smell the pizza for a 10 minute drive on the way to her house. It took everything in me not to pull over on the side of the road and gobble a slice then and there, but for me it's almost as much about the experience eating the food as the food itself, so I wanted to cherish the moment. So to make a long story short, I got home, took one bite of the pizza, tasted this sweet and salty sausage on fresh dough with the cheesy of all cheeses and I knew why my sister made me drive out of my way to pick it up. Now, I live by about 10 pizza places, but I would actually drive the 20 minutes to Spinato's for this pizza. It's hard to explain, but it's something about the combination of ingredients and the authentic pizza parlor feel when you bite into a slice. It's just one of those pizzas you have to try in your life. So, if you are ever in the area or up for a drive, my suggestion is giving Spinato's a try. For pizza in Arizona, it ain't bad!I rarely visit a restaurant where the service stands out to the point that it deserves an update to the five star review I already gave it. While visiting Spinatos recently, I couldn't help but notice how very friendly the restaurant staff. Immediately upon entering, we were greeted by a very friendly hostess who showed us to our seats and grabbed us water right away. Then, the second the the hostess left, the waitress appeared and enthusiastically greeted us. The friendly service continued until the moment we left and it left a lasting impression on me. Staff is normally friendly, but the Spinatos staff definitely woke up on the right side of the bed and you can tell that they truly love where they work! Great pizza and great staff! A + Spinatos!I HATE when I have a preconceived review of a 5 star rating and I get disappointed. I just wish I tried this one for lunch not a full dinner. Spinatos disappointed me big time. The waitress was a ditz, seemed like she was busy thinking about drinking as soon as she got off work. The pizza was OK... they did not ask what crust we preferred and we got the thin. (not my favorite) The toppings were very sparse and not that fresh. (we got the 6 toppings on kinda like a "everything" The sauce was so sweet I thought it was a frozen kid pizza. The salad, while large, was brown wilted, bagged lettuce. The tomatoes were dry and colorless. We asked for garlic ranch and she gave us Italian. They do not have Blue Cheese dressing either The ravioli was boring, the bread stick was hard and dried out. She came by asked what type of gelato the kids wanted, came back 5 min later and had totally forgot she asked asked already. I was not impressed at all by the entire meal.I have been the biggest Spinato's fan since the once small pizza parlor had one location in the valley. It has been exciting to see them grow. I guess what I like the most is the service is always the same no matter which lcoation you dine at. Even the food it consistanct. I recently dined with my family this past Mother's Day. The whole crew my family, friends and I came in to dine at one big table. We ordered a variety of all the fixings so we can all have the pleasure to sampele each other's favorite entree. The portion size of our pizza, garlic toast, cheese toast and salads were reasonable. I tried something different this time. I went with the Gluten Free Pizza. Boy was it yumm!. I did not feel like I was missing out on anything. Matter fact it was so good not one person at the table had an opportunity to sample mine. It was gone in no time. Everything is made fresh at Spinato's. They have some of the tastiest freshhome made sauces. Be sure to check out the website. You can order food to go.This is legit pizza, and I am a real tough critic when it comes to pizza. We ordered two pizzas: Italian beef pizza and a sausage/mushroom/ black olive pizza. Their sauce is sweet, but not too sweet. Their Italian beef with giardiniera pizza is the best version I have had. It's clear that the Italian beef is made in-house.  The sweet sauce balances the spice in the giardiniera perfectly.  Thier sausage was good, but not the best I have had. I like fennel sausage with a little more flavor. Overall, the pizza was great. I will be going back to try an Italian beef sandwich.
Canton Wong #8=I think that Myles and Kristin already said a lot of what you need to know about this sketchy-looking but oh-so-handy-to-have-nearby Chinese place, so I'll just hammer out the highlights:-Closed Mondays -Delivery area goes from 34th Street (E) to 35th Ave (W) and 1-17 (N) to Dobbins (S). Do note, though, that we live off of 19th Ave south of Dobbins (about 1 mile south of the southernmost boundary of the delivery zone) and they said that they would deliver to us without a problem, so definitely still try if you're just outside of the zone. -There is a $12 pre-tax minimum for delivery -Food is decent quality for the price and not as greasy as one would expect-Paper menus have some decent coupons on them. Best one gives you 10 free crab puffs or 3 free egg rolls with purchase of $15 or more-Lunch specials are ridiculously cheap (from $3.50 - $4.50 for entree and rice; $4.15 to $4.88 for entree, rice, egg roll, and crab puff) and are served until 3:30 pmDefinitely not worth driving to if you don't live in South Phoenix. However, if you do live in South Phoenix, this is a cheap and reliable Chinese dine-in, pick-up, and delivery place.
People's Bakery=This place is so accidental hipster, and defies categorization. Is it a diner? A bakery? An auntie's living room? Let's just say if a donut shop and a small restaurant played Tetris, this would be the result. The eating area is quiet - no music, just the drink cooler humming - and the experience eclectic - mismatched formica tables, plastic cups for water, and tea cups with feet for the Turkish coffee. The Turkish coffee was weaker than expected, but wonderfully aromatized with cardamom. There was so much food my eyes pin-balled for a minute. The red lentil soup made with sprouted lentils came in a bowl - a real bowl, not a cup-sized bowl. We also had the gyro plate which was satisfying, and mousaka entree which was like an eggplant, potato, and tomato casserole over yellow rice. By itself, the mousaka would last me two additional meals. We couldn't resist the Boston creme donut, which turned out to be the best I've had in Madison, and a gigantic cinnamon roll fritter. Plus the two coffees, the total came out to be $25 (!!) and some change. The service is a relaxed pace, but the owners were charming and seemed to enjoy us enjoying their food. My five-star ratings often depend on how likely and how often I would return, and this place definitely makes the twice-a-month cut.
Panda Garden=Went to lunch with coworkers on a Thursday, it was a last lunch outing for one of our coworkers who is leaving the company and one of my coworkers  suggested we get Chinese food, now still being new to our area we didn't know where to go, so whipped out the Yelp App and searched for Chinese food near here and found Panda Garden, so the place was set and off we went.We were a party of 5 and we didn't have to wait got seated pretty quickly for being high noon, sat at our tables and looked the menu, I was impressed with the selection they have for their daily lunch specials, and if those didn't interest you, they have a great looking lunch menu too. And the daily lunch specials even run on sat too, thought that was a nice touch as well.I wish I caught our servers name, I believe she might have been the hostess as well, she was very friendly and very nice, we all told her it was our 1st time there she asked us were we work and just had conversations with us, felt like a nice family place.I ordered the Gang Pang Chicken lunch combo with Lo Mein Noodles, I wanted to try something I never had before & something that was spicy, and this dish looked like the winner for me. The chicken was lighted battered and covered in this great tasting sauce and it had sliced green onions & fresh jalapenos, and with the lo mien noodles, that dish was delish!!  I just need to remember to ask for more heat next time, but that's because I love things spicy hot!Happy to found Panda Garden and looking forward to adding them to my fast lunch time eats!
La Feria=Pittsburgh is a funny city. There are fantastic high end restaurants (e.g. Tamari, Spoon, 9 on 9, 11, etc...), but not so many medium-to-low-end restaurants. Well, La Feria is the clear exception. For $15 (or less) you can have an amazing Peruvian meal. My wife and I are experimenting with vegetarianism (I know, we're missing out on a lot of yummy meals!), and La Feria is particularly great for us. They always have 2 veggie specials that are great. Last night I had this bean and pumpkin dish which was fantastic.The atmosphere is pretty laid back and the staff are friendly, so for a quick and tasty dinner, this is the place to go.
That's A Wrap=Fresh. Convenient. Cheap. And I'm not talking about me as a date. It's That's A Wrap! Or It's A Wrap. Or Wraps N Things. Not sure, but me likey! I've only had one thing and it was the turkey wrap with cream cheese and strawberry preserves in a whole wheat tortilla. Dee lish! Side pasta dish was, well, your basic cold side pasta dish. The day we were there, the room was luke warm at best. No A/C! Almost made me want to run for the hills. But we got it to go and enjoyed it at home. Besides the customers who were there were stinky teenagers with pants hanging at their knees, bad posture and sad, sulky little faces. Oh, puberty!Dear That's A Wrap,I've only met you once, but it was love at first sight... I found you easily - on 7th street just north of McDowell and lots of parking in your private lot made me happy. I walked in and felt comfortable immediately - very casual, laid back atmosphere and welcoming staff. Since my lunch companion was a little late, I had time to observe the place, the menu, and even read a New Times that was out for your patrons. A few things I noticed during my wait:1 - you are incredibly fast and efficient!2 - you have smoothies on the back of the menu and they look delicious!3 - you don't mind when people special order4 - I didn't hear any whining or complaining at all while I was thereThe list could go on, but my friend arrived and we ordered.  I had the 'Veggie Jackson' wrap - no onions or rice, add tofu with a side of fresh fruit. My friend had the 'Very Brady Clubster' with a side of fruit as well. We both commented how delicious our wraps were and the fruit was good too! The veggies in my sandwich were grilled to perfection and the combination of flavors from the feta and balsamic salsa blended just right.  I felt like each bite was a party in my mouth.  Sounds cheesy, but I swear, it's true!  Serving size was perfect and so was the price!  (Everything on the menu is $6.95 or less and even if you add chicken or tofu, it's less than $1).It's going to be kind of a hike for me since I'm moving further north, but I will be back for sure...See you soon, my new love!:)GabiThis is the kind of faux genius I am:  I went to the wrap place and got a bowl.  Truth be told though, it was the right move, at least for me.  On a day when I was newly in town and running on fumes, That's a Wrap saved my bacon with some BBQ. Unsurprisingly, I have a soft spot for BBQ, and the bowl available here shows up tasty, packed thorough with veggies and rice, and warm chicken doused in BBQ.  If you're going, get there early as the place was jam-packed when we hit around lunchtime, but even so, service was quick and we were able to procure a table without too much waiting.  Next time I'm in the neighborhood, I definitely wouldn't mind stopping back in.I took advantage of That's A Wrap for their catering services yesterday and once again, was totally impressed!  I called around 10am for a 5pm delivery... I wanted to make sure that those of us who were working at the Phoenix Art Museum all day preparing for the pARTy had some fuel to get us through the evening.  Sure enough, That's A Wrap delivered - literally and figuratively.  I ordered a platter of assorted sandwiches, fruit, chips, cookies, and bottled water - it was perfect!  Everything was delicious!  It arrived right on time and it was all labeled so it was easy to figure out what you were eating.  I had the "Godfather" wrap (Salami, ham, and provolone wrapped in a honey wheat tortilla with lettuce, tomato, red onion, sun- dried tomato mayo and a drizzle of olive oil).  I don't usually choose salami and ham but for whatever reason, this is the one that sounded best to me yesterday - and it was!Thanks That's A Wrap for fueling me and all of the yelper helpers for the pARTy... I'll be back to visit soon!Delicious!B introduced me to this place because he eats here at least twice a week, and my god, I now understand why. They have the most delicious wraps I have ever tasted in my entire life!Fresh delicious ingredients that are actually healthy for you.. and I love nothing more than healthy food that doesn't taste healthy at all.. for instance, the teriyaki 90210.. Grilled teriyaki chicken, crunchy veggies, fresh ginger slaw & jasmine rice.. amazing! Rocky VII, who doesn't love cheese-steak?? Not the healthiest choice they have to offer, but goddamn delicious. Ive also tried the Gringo Star which is the mexicany wrap and The Godfather with salami, ham and my favorite, provolone. I usually get the pasta salad to accompany my lunch, which is also, very yummy. Ive literally never tried anything here my mouth didn't instantly fall in love with. Really, the only thing that sucks about this place is the parking lot.. its tiny! You're lucky if  you can even find a spot during the lunch rush, and if you do, you're lucky if you can get your vehicle out of there once you've parked. People create their own spots at this joint, sometimes behind your car.. but really, park across the street and walk if you have to, it is absolutely worth it!
The Wrigley Mansion Club=Is it an historic mansion, high above Phoenix, with a famous history of who's who? Indeed. Was it a fun venue for a concert by CeCe Peniston? Absolutely. Did I enjoy the limo, wine in the dressing room and VIP treatment from their staff? You bet your sweet ass I did. But the smell. Seriously. Like my geriatric Aunt Helen's closet. Or the community room at a convalescent home. Or Bea Arthur's hair. Here I thought it would smell like Juicy Fruit.Sweet.  I went to the bar, Geordie's, for my first visit to the Mansion.  Had a few glasses of wine and then started to wander.  What a neat place to get away from it all and relax.  The bar menu is pretty limited so keep that in mind, oh and I hear that this place closes for special events so always call ahead. And the view is not too bad either.I have now attended a few events at Wrigley, or "The Mansion" as I like to call it. "What are you doing tonight?""Oh I am attending a little soiree at 'The Mansion." I want to live here,,,and be Batman...maybe Iron Man, I haven't decided for sure. Go here. Be Tony Stark, or Bruce Wayne for the night.There is something indescribably awesome about donning the pocket square and having drinks and socializing in a friggin masion.The drinks tend to be pricey but if they weren't I don't know if I would feel nearly as cool being here. When I live here I will throw crazy UYEs so you should all be prepared to dress the nines and party all night.I love the Wrigley Mansion! I was there a few years ago for a wine maker's dinner and it was beyond memorable: the food, the wine, the views.And, just last night about 12 of us gathered to celebrate a birthday. The staff were very accommodating and offered us the loft above Geordie's for a semiprivate feel. We didn't have any "minimums" or "room rentals." Our server did a great job and got quite the work out going up and down the stairs with our drinks and food! Happy hour runs until 7 and features $5 specialty martinis, which are full size and strength! There's even a tequilla-tini that tastes like a margarita and looks like a Mexican flag!The executive chef came up to welcome and thank our group, which was such a hospitable gesture! I told him how I enjoyed the truffle fries and the burger (see Andrew K's review - BTW, I'm the one who screwed it up by saying "not too much pink") and he explained how they pride themselves on knowing where all their food comes from. They even dry those apples themselves - in-house!It's true that the place was NOT crowded, which works for me because it means I don't have to fight with anyone for a seat to watch some of the country's best sunsets over a cocktail! I really need to come here more often! I will definitely be back!!This was the first time I'd been to Wrigley Mansion while it was open.  I had a "private tour" by an employee once and got to see everything and it really is a great place.Went for a birthday party and we had dinner.  $5 for valet parking, which is really reasonable, I think.  Especially in heels, cuz this girl ain't walkin' up them thar stairs.  We had a private dining room, about 25 or so of us.  Wait staff did an awesome job dealing with such a huge party and handling our bill.If it weren't for the food and price, I would have given this place 5 stars.  I started with the leek tart, which was amazing and a great portion size for an appetizer.Next, had the Tuna Nicoise salad.  This is where they lose a star, and it wasn't just me voicing a problem with the size of the portion.  There was definitely plenty of tuna on it, but as Erin said "You'd think they would have put more of the cheap stuff on it" meaning there wasn't a whole lot of salad.  And the roasted potatoes that came with it?  I had two cubes of HARD potatoes.  They were barely cooked.  The tuna was perfectly seared on the outside and still nicely red on the inside.  If it weren't for that, I would have been horribly disappointed.  $43 for an appetizer, a salad and a bottle of Pellegrino.  (That included the gratuity added for such a large group).  Wrigley is all about the ambiance and view, and it surpasses what you could describe it to be.  Seeing the city at night and being surrounded by cool peeps is what really made the place!The Wrigley Mansion is one of a few historical venues in a city that does not value its past and history. That said, you would think that fact would guarantee a top quality meal and fine dining experience at Geordie's Restaurant. Regrettably, Geordie's turned out to be no better than any other overly-hyped but underwhelming restaurant one would find at a 4- or 5-star resort.I have lived in the Valley for nearly 10 years, and last night was the first time I had ever visited the Wrigley Mansion. I always felt somewhat guilty for never have visited, but I can say with near 100% certainty that my first visit is also my last. The service and wait staff performed well, but the food was the equivalent of one might get at Applebee's, and certainly not worth what I paid.I started off with the carpaccio, which was probably the most disappointing part of the meal. I have had some mediocre carpaccio before, but never this poorly prepared. I suspect a bad cut of beef. I also ordered a side of their white truffle fries that arrived with excessive garlic. The fries themselves were overcooked and tasted like Jack In The Box fries. Generous amounts of catsup were required to make them somewhat edible. For the entrée I tried the server-recommended lamb chop, which I requested to be prepared medium. When it arrived, it was clearly not medium. The meat was tough and lacked any flavor, and the au jus was entirely too salty.The beverage service was quite prompt, however I think the bartender should go back to mixology school. The Manhattan I ordered had too much vermouth and hardly any bitters, while the lemon drop was neither sweet or bitter.The purpose of the evening was to celebrate a friends birthday, so our dinner party had a whole room to ourselves. Given the size of the party, the wait staff did do an excellent job of making sure we were well served. Our glasses were never empty and the food did arrive promptly. Unfortunately, that alone could not make up for the poor food quality and exorbitant price.The food was pretty disappointing for the price, and the drinks menu left much to be desired.  The music was ok, and the service was very close to on-point for the size of the party.  The space is tremendous; as many have said, it's one of the very few places like it in Phoenix with real history.  I just wish they would bring the kitchen and bar up to the same level as the location.I was really excited to visit the Wrigley for my friends birthday. I have been meaning to try this place for years and the Yelp hype has been pretty strong. I was immediately impressed by the staff, we had a very big group and they were attentive and got our drinks and orders in right away. The view of the city was breathtaking and I would come back for happy hour, but just to watch the sunset and a have a cocktail.  That being said... Geordie's restaurant had horrible food. Honestly, one star at best. I had the Cesar salad which was fishy with stale croutons. I also tried the beet and goat cheese salad and I kept looking around for the goat cheese, I had one small dollop hiding under a bib of lettuce. The carpaccio was the worst I have ever tasted. I think the cut may have been bad and I couldn't take more than two bites. I also ordered a side of their white truffle fries; they were the only part of my meal that was anything more than mediocre. For my main I had the tenderloin and it was tough and chewy, the potatoes that came on the side were a joke.  I've been told that Wrigley has the "pay what you will" for lunch. If they applied this to the dinner they served I would left with a much heavier wallet. All in all the over hyped experience left me quite under whelmed. Sure it is a great place to impress your out of town guests with, for the view and history alone. Just take them somewhere else for dinner (like Dick's or Café Barrio) if you want an impressive meal.I am pissed!  I have been attending the Wrigley Mansion for music on the patio for over a year now, and have been raving to all of my friends about it.  All the stars happened to align this last Sunday, and ten (10) of my friends attended with me.I was embarrassed because it was no longer the same Wrigley.In two weeks (since I was there last), all the rules changed.  The cool band, Delcoa, is no longer the band.  There is no longer a $7 buffet.  There remains half price bottles of wine, but they increased the price of the bottles.  Um, excuse me, but if I am going to a casual event on an outdoor patio, why the hell would I buy a $90 bottle of wine (discounted to $45...ooh, what a bargain)!!!?  I swear, even the outdoor lighting has been removed!!!And they have no Facebook presence where I might have been notified...nothing different on the website to indicate a "rebranding."They did still have a good crowd.  I think the crowd follows the band, so all of these people were new to me.  But they were not prepared.  The service was very poor.  (Remember, I was seated at a table of 10...Hello!!!?  Cha Ching!!!?)It's likely I won't be back.My wife and I went here Friday night.  Our plan was to sit in the lounge, enjoy a few cocktails and have some appetizers and a burger.  This plan was thwarted when the bar tender looked at me like I was insane when I asked about their burger.  He told us they haven't had a burger in years.  The bar menu on their website clearly states that they have a burger which was perfect because my wife and I weren't in the mood for the fancy fare of their main dining room.We sat at a table on their patio.  The weather was perfect and the view was even better.  We ordered our first round of drinks and yes they do jack you on the price but that was to be expected.  We then ordered some food to share.* Flat bread pizza thing - excellent* Beet salad - pretty good and pretty unique.  I can't explain it but it is worth a try.* Oysters - not so good.  I have no idea why we got this but for some reason my wife wanted it so go figure.* Truffled mac n' cheese - OMG - Best.  Thing.  Ever.The mansion itself is beautiful but could use a bit of updating especially on the inside.  I do regret, however, not exploring the mansion as much as I should have.  We pretty much stuck to one small wing of the place but there was probably so much more to it than we saw.Oh...and their parking situation is a complete clusterfuk.  The signage telling you where to park, where the valet is, and how to get to the mansion entrance is a complete joke and almost non-existent.  Would it kill them to have more/bigger signs and maybe some lights so you can see them?** Pro Tip = get the $50 Local Dines gift cert for $25 ( http://bit.ly/dfR4eQ ).  Of course they will complain and try to tell you all the rules that somehow aren't listed anywhere.  They will even try to tell you what "dinner" food is and what is not.  Just tell them that if you want oysters and vodka for dinner then that is your choice.  If they want you to get a $65 steak in the main dining room they should clearly say that on the offer.I was excited to try this place and when I saw the travelzoo deal I jumped on it. I was trying to think of the best way to describe their food and it reminded me of convention center food.  I think they have catered to too many weddings and have lost the art of cooking quality meals.This is also one of those places where you get the feeling that its cool to pay more for less. We were seated inside after requesting a patio seat and we brought the average age down about 30 years. It was hot and stuffy and the seats were so uncomfortable I had to take some advil when I got home. Had the worst french onion soup I've ever seen/ eaten (not sure how you mess that up?) and the salmon was too salty even for me.  I'm would not consider myself a food snob but I have eaten plenty of good food and this place just doesn't make the cut.  The only plus side to our dinner was being able to walk around the mansion and see the decor afterwards.  If we had actually been able to sit on the patio I"m sure the view would have been nice.In summary.... Average age: 65 Food quality: sub par Decor: antique Bill with discount: $110 Recommend? NOWell let me start by saying if your not in great shape (triathlete) don't even attempt to take the stairs that lead up to the mansion. I mean there really should be some warning that if your over age 50 you may not make it up there. So with that being said I think it is clearly a ruse to make sure you pay for Valet parking because if you drive to the top of the hill they will gladly park your car for you and you can walk right into the mansion. We had dinner at Geordie's restaurant because they were offering a $30 per person 3 course meal to promote restaurant week here in phoenix. The food was pretty good....not great. The service was pretty good....but not great. The Mansion was pretty good.....but not great. However the view was great....we got to see the sun sunset along with the beautiful mountains so at least that was a treat. We didn't have dessert but the offerings on the menu looked good...but not great.So I guess you see my point this place is good....not great....so if that is what your looking for then Eat, Drink, and be Merry my Friends!!!!I suddenly knew this was a mistake as soon as we started to scale the steep difficult steps and the handrail covered with a large amount of bird POOP. My stomach turned and I couldn't imagine why they don't have somebody to clean the handrail.We were a few minutes early for our reservation so we walked around a bit. It is an interesting OLD House with narrow hallways and a small room with an old fashioned operators switchboard. It does have beautiful views. The house has a beautiful entrance door and interesting intricate ceilings but over all it really isn't so grand with old worn carpet and common tiles. I thought I'd see a bunch of marble or granite but I didn't.We thought this was an interesting Choice for restaurant week because we wanted to see this place. Also this was one of the few places that gave you three courses without dessert. Also the $10 non member fee was waived for restaurant week.I can't say the food was completely awful but I wouldn't come back for it either even for free so I think that qualifies for the one star rating.We asked about cocktails and our waiter said they were the last page of the wine menu but they weren't and only lasted the liquors. He returned and my husband asked for the cocktail menu we saw outside and the waiter brings us the cocktail menu. I decided on a drink but the waiter didn't return for a long period of time so we decided to just order dinner and skip the cocktails.Our waiter said the Sous Vide Chicken was stuffed with something green and he didn't know what it was but to him it was very salty. He also said the Carpaccio wasn't very good. So we decided to go with the other two starters.The starters were passable but nothing either of us would want again. A not so great crab cake sitting on creamy peas with two refrigerated cold roasted tomatoes. The other was a few slices of eggplant with a little cheese.The middle plates were not so seasoned escargots with a forgettable salad. The highlight was a small chunk of gorgonzola cheese. The other middle plate was not hot and not cold but unhealthy room temperature tomato soup with a over whipped cream laced with truffle aroma. (Aroma means perfume) (and over whipped means turned to butter). We both thought the tomato soup was the best of what we tried here. It tasted like good tomatoes that would be great on a pizza.For dinner we tried the duck and the bronzini. Both were cooked just OK but neither seemed to have good seasoning or flavor however both of our vegetables were salted too heavy. I'd say so heavy I could tell what kind of salt they used and it wasn't good salt. The one thing that I could honestly say WAS terrible was the artichoke , anise sabayon. I tasted it and nearly barffed. I am without words to describe how it tasted but the texture was like hummus. Both plates had what they called polenta towers. They looked (see photo) happy to see us and I thought mine might squirt something when I went to eat it. But I was baffled when I tasted it because it wasn't like polenta. It was like corn muffin mix that was mixed with a farina kind of cereal. It was bready and lacked much of the corn taste and really tasted like cream of wheat cereal.I can almost say forgettable but I can't because I will never forget the bird poop or the polenta tower.1.5 stars almost 2 stars but with price factored in I feel one starSLIGHT UPDATE 9-11-13I read that they got a new chef since my review so hopefully they are better now.Start with one penny and double it, then double the double, and continue doubling daily. You would be a millionaire within 30 days. Know anyone who could pull that off? Not me! For us working folk it takes two weeks of doubling down to afford Sunday brunch for two at Wrigley Mansion ($49pp). Worth it!  The mansion is atop Telewa Trail close to the canal. The best entrance for check-in was on the SE side; upstairs from valet parking. The host was sitting there. But if you use regular parking downhill, then walk up through the pedestrian entrance on the NW side and make your way through the leftmost rooms towards the host. Table was already assigned and we were politely escorted to a white room with big windows. Lighting was wonderful and tables adequately spaced. As soon as we settled in, a server introduced himself to us and gave the banquet 411. Then glasses were promptly filled with freely flowing mimosas. They were refilled several times while dining.Take a moment to give thanks. God bless Abundance. My belly is always on my mind and my mind on my belly. This quality buffet presented a fun bingeful experience for my appetite. Not my waistline though, BUT I am currently in the R&D stage of an invention that burns calories as I eat. It's patented! Binge buffeting is 'bout to be the shizith!Binge. Did I say a bad word? I don't mean it badly. I chose to hit each food section only once and use one plate at each. So I didn't overstuff - loosely speaking. Let me paint the picture: I had four courses - fruit, salad, entre, and dessert and seconds on dessert, but who's counting... Food in the banquet room had been placed at six stations. I stood there with closed eyes pretending that everything was revolving around me. Fooooooood. Here's how it looked; going clockwise.  1. At the long center table was about five hot pots. I remember a pilaf, yellow rice, sauteed vegetable medley, salmon in lobster bisque, and a meat dish. Veggie medley was mildly seasoned. Nothing dark green in the mix so I just took a couple pieces of cauliflower. The salmon was very soft and didn't actually taste like salmon. Maybe it was because of the bisque.  2. On the south wall was the made-to-order pancake and omelet station. This section was manned and those men were a bit stingy with ingredients. Pans were small so my order for a pancake ended up being a weecake. When I asked to have it topped with fresh blueberries, about five berries were doled out. Mr. Omelet Maker was no less stingy. I requested more veggies because he only gave a pinch of my favorites. Literally a pinch.  SUGGESTION: Let the diners self-pick ingredients into a small bowl which they can hand to the servers while ordering pancakes and omelets.3. To the right of omelet pinchville was the dessert spread. I'm pretty sure I was the first binger to crack into them. Cheesecake, chocolate cake, 3 flavors of cupcakes, brownies, apple squares, apple tart, chocolate chip cookies, snickerdoodles, carrot cake, and numerous petite fours including one of pumpkin cheesecake. YUM! 4. A few feet from there was the fresh salad table. Strangely, choices were few and there was only one dressing, maybe two. I remember a huge bowl of crisp romaine lettuce and another bowl of mixed lettuces, also a small platter of roasted peppers and things, olives, onions, capers, pickled condiments. Not much for a salad lover.5. Along the north wall, was the carving and seafood station. There were slabs of red meat which a server sliced thinly for you, crab legs which he cracked for you, and other sea beings like shrimp were served cold. 6. The table along the east wall was by far the longest and most diverse section - the "breakfast" station. On one end huge bowls of cantaloupe, honeydew, strawberries, pineapple, blackberries, watermelon, raspberries. The stars of the fruit show were pineapple and blackberry; both sweet and ooh so juicy. Raspberries were good. Watermelon was okay. Cantaloupe and honeydew unfortunately were unripened. Every bite seemed like rind.   The breakfast table continued with cold stuffs like cereal, yogurt, jams, croissants and danishes, muffins, and then it transitioned to the hot items. There were three or four pots, one with seasoned potatoes. Most likely there was some kind of sausage, and maybe oatmeal too.This club definitely caters highly to its customers. Staff was bustling nonstop to clear away empty plates and refill glasses. The bill was brought to the table after we finished - a first in my buffet experience.  Minor annoyance: Every time we left the table, we'd come back to find napkins refolded and placed neatly at our places. So all morning the server was touching and retouching everyone's dirty napkin. SUGGESTION: Stop that! Leave my napkin alone OR give me a clean one. I would definitely come again, but at mansion prices the buffet is the only meal I would  consider returning for.
Breadcrafters Bakery & Cafe=You threw my sandwich away... my sandwich.... MY SANDWICH! My friends always tease me when we are searching for a good sandwich shop.  I have been told on more then one occassion that I can be little "Ross" or "Joey"  like from the show  "Friends" when it comes to my sandwiches. Today, we went to Breadcrafters Bakery and Cafe for lunch, and it was absolutely delicious. I've had many sandwiches from all over the valley and the folks at Breadcrafters Bakery and Cafe are doing up sandwiches right. Lookout,  AJ's Whole Foods, Jimmy Johns, Quiznos, Capriottis, and all the others; Breadcrafters Bakery and Cafe is here.Breadcrafters offers great lunch specials.  You can get a sandwich and your choice of potato salad, pasta salad, fruit salad,  or chips.  Today, my lunch companion and I had the tuna salad on sourdough and the Focaccia Deluxe  (turkey,ham, salami, provolone, lettuce, tomatoes, Parmesan pesto, on Italian herb bread) with a side of potato salad and fruit salad.  I have to admit the Parmesean Pesto spread  was fantastic and the potato salad is the best I ever had. All the breads at Breadcrafters Bakery and Cafe are made fresh daily.  The Walnut Pecan Raisin, Swiss & Black Pepper, look delicious.  I can't wait to try them all on my next visit.If your in the area give Breadcrafters a try.  Expect great sandwiches, salads, soups, desserts, and the best customer service.
Tazza D'oro Cafe & Espresso Bar=On my recent road trip from Dallas to New Haven, CT, Randy S. and I stopped in Pittsburgh to revel in its charms. This, I must add, was in opposition to his mother's strong protests to the effect of, "There's nothing *in* Pittsburgh, why would anyone go there?" Tazza D'oro is the answer to that question. Especially if you like coffee. This is easily one of the best coffee shops east of the Mississippi, and I've been to a lot of them. So, what's so good about it?Let's go in order of importance:Coffee - It is really, really good. They use Batdorf and Bronson beans, where an ex-gf of mine used to work in Olympia. Believe me when I tell you that B&B is good. It's not amazingly great, but it's very solid and they take roasting seriously. When I go to a new coffee place I suspect might be good I always get a latte. Why? This one has a high upside if done well and the lowest downside (lots of milk) if done poorly. I got a latte. They have a few sizes, 12oz was the first one I got. It was fantastic. They did a nice little rosetta in it too (look up latte art on google if you have no idea what this is). The baristo really knew what he was doing and pulled a some good shots with excellent crema. The coffee was so good (coffee is supposed to taste bold, smooth and rich, which it almost never does and this place had it down) I had to go back for an 8oz, which is another level of trust. It has the same amount of coffee but less milk to hide poor coffee quality. It was always superior. This is a coffee place that is truly top notch based on the coffee alone, but there was more. Pastries - They all looked amazing. I had a plain donut while I waited in line. Normally I don't eat plain donuts, because life is too short for plain donuts, but it was really, very good. Everyone was commenting on how nice the pastries were.Atmosphere - This place has it exactly right. It's a mom & pop feel, nothing forced. Some tables, outdoor seating, maybe some local art, but not in a goofy sort of way. Very friendly employees. Just a complete home run. Obviously I loved it. Behind me in line for my re-up, I heard a girl behind me in line complain, "we could just go to Starbucks, it's cheaper!" then proceeded to order with sugar free syrups and skim milk. That's fine. Everyone has to do what they like... and with the proliferation of bad coffee (Starbucks only being guilty of mediocre, though a little bit interesting coffee) over the past 10 years, I don't blame people for being set that way. But the beautiful thing about Tazza D'Oro (cup of gold in Italian) is that--if you let it--it will remind you that you don't need to make your coffee up like a drag queen on Halloween.Tazza D'Oro stands as a reminder that coffee can be enjoyed in all its naked glory in an awesome setting on a beautiful street and give you a good f'ing reason to go to Pittsburgh.What a cute little coffee shop in such an idealistic setting!  I sat amongst the gathered hipsters, moms, friends, ladies who lunch, power business lunch people in a sunny little corner of the room sipping my delicious Indian Spice black tea.Service was very friendly and looking at the fresh pastries and lunch list of homemade soups and sandwiches made me want to come back and enjoy a leisurely afternoon or perhaps work day here taking in all they have to offer.  I was surprised when I asked to see the tea list and the barista told me they didn't have much to offer.  Still looked like a good amount to me and I was pleased to see a variety of different offerings some coffee shops don't offer (because, well, they're usually coffee focused!).  I also enjoy that they use loose leaf tea, so you know it's not just coming straight outta a generic box of Twinings.  FREE internet is always a big plus with lots of outlets.  Now if someone could just find me an affordable house in Highland Park this could just be my next favorite neighborhood coffee shop!
Thai Lahna Restaurant=I can't rate Thai Lahna higher than 3 stars, although their Thai Coffee and Thai tea are 5-star worthy. The food was just okay. In fact, it read more appealing on the menu, which is gigantic. How is one ever suppose to decide?My lunch buddy and I went today to try Thai Lahna for the first time. It was pretty full around 12:30. I snagged a table. Service was prompt and we had waters in no time. We ordered a shrimp app that was made in chili/lime sauce with mint and lemongrass. Uhm, it was okay. The shrimp is nothing to write home about, but I did enjoy munching on the bed of lettuce that was drenched in the spicy sauce. I really, really, really wanted this to knock my socks off, for the seasonings sounded like they would create an "oh my god" experience. What a shame.I ordered the Eggplant Jay, since it came highly recommended. Little did I know I'd have to fight off 500,000 onions for one piece of super delicious eggplant. Not my idea of a good time. I really wish this dish could have been better. The eggplant was good - what there was of it.My friend ordered veggies in red curry with coconut. It was pretty tasty, until you bit into a sliver of corn and about fell out of your chair from the punch of salt. Wowza. Price was decent. The app ended up costing more than either of our entrees, which was strange to me. But, oh well. It averaged out to about $20 a person for all that, drinks and tip included. Parking is a cinch, since it's in public lot. I had no problem finding a spot during the lunch rush.SOMETHING STRANGE: We weren't asked if we wanted to box up our left overs until AFTER we had paid and were getting ready to leave. I thought that was strange. But, it would have been one thing if I had really wanted to take the food home with me. I didn't. Chance of my coming back here? Same chance as UCONN winning the NCAA tournament this year. 0%, thanks to an upset by San Diego. What a game... The next time I'm craving Thai, I'll stick with Malee's, like Pierre said.So I really wanted to Yelp something today. So, a buddy (@groovypucks) and I went to Thai Lahna.  I noticed it had a LOT of reviews and still maintained a pretty reputable score!  Hey, its only a block or two from work, so why not?We get there and are immediately seated which in my opinion is rare.  For the rave reviews, I noticed it was kind of 'dead' for a lunch crowd.  A few old people and the owners were all I really noticed.  We get a booth seat (I love booth seats.  If I could work, sleep and eat in a booth seat, I would die a happy man) so I am already getting excited.  Groovypucks and I take way too long looking at the menu and finally decide on our dishes (which we accompanied with a Thai Tea).  I asked to make my curry spicy(#36 Yellow Curry Chicken with Green Beans), and it WAS!  Almost too spicy, but I attribute that to my lack of experience with their dishes.  If I were to order it again, I would order it medium.Groovy got a Peanut and Chicken dish (#35) with onions and peppers.  I tried a bit, as I am comfortable in my sexuality, and I really liked it.  It was Damn good! That's right, Capital D!  The service for the rest of the meal was below par, but not to the point that it was annoying.  It just took a little too long to get my food and my check at the end......And with this review I leave you with my fortuneIf strength were all,tiger would not fear scorpion.Mmmm.... Thai Lahna. Thai Lahna is the person you spy from across the room that you're not too sure about but then after talking to them you find out that they're pretty damn cool. Yeah, that's my Thai Lahna.My group walked into the store front restaurant and were greeted immediately. Some of the crew had already arrived and arranged for a large table to be assembled. Nice! We sat down to look over the menu. I already knew that I wanted to order the pad thai because that's my "test dish" for thai places I've never been to. I also selected the masaman curry. There were six of us and everyone got dishes to share. When the food came out, it was a TON of food. We decided to do the good ol' Yelp Conveyer belt (chomp, chomp, give). My pad thai and my curry were spot on, and perfectly spicy. Everything I had was very good. I don't think I had an issue with anything. So why not a 5 star review? Simply put it's not the best Thai food that I've had, but it's pretty damn close and the service was a bit lacking. Thai Lahna is a must try if you're in the mood for some savory, spicy food!I recently was craving Thai food and came across some pretty stunning reviews for Thai Lahna. I must say... I was REALLY impressed! My table started with the vegetarian hot and sour soup. Everyone really seemed to enjoy the flavors and the plethora of veggies. I love those little flaming soup bowls they use. I ordered the yellow curry with tofu, mild/medium as my entree. That is generally my staple Thai item and it was REALLY good. Extremely flavorful and a great portion size. The restaurant itself was pretty small and the bathroom scenario left a little to be desired, but I was certainly impressed with our quality of service. We split the bill four ways and added a cash to-go order. The poor girl handled our complicated check out very well. I can't believe I lived within walking distance from Thai Lahna for over a year and missed out on such a delicious place!!Woo hoo! Thai Lahna now has a website: http://thailahna.com/index.html. It will be so much easier for me to order to-go now!When I have a hankerin' for a new Thai place, I contact Chris T.  He recommended Thai Lahna and I am a bit perturbed that it's so close to my house.  You see, I go pretty often.  Like twice a month.  I always get the #35, which is a peanut dish in a brown sauce.  It's orgasmic.  Seriously.  It comes with chicken, but you can substitute tofu, which is key in my book.  Staff is very friendly, though I almost always get take-out.  I drool as I drive home with my bag neatly closed, smelling it down Indian School.I could seriously eat here every day! I have been coming to Thai Lahna since I was young and the Pad Thai is always a must (comes with chicken AND shrimp)! This last time we went, I ordered the Tohm Khah Kai soup (add a side of rice) and it was literally out of this world. The best part was that it came flaming! {Great for Yelp photos! ;)} My boyfriend and I were practically drinking the bowl by the time we were done. It is definitely enough for 2-4 to share before your main meal. It is the BEST dish on a cool winter evening! Since Thai Lahna is only a bike ride from my house, I will 100% be back soon!
Roland's Seafood Grill=I would give this restaurant 0 stars if I could.  The food was lousy, the drinks were expensive, and the service was awful.I complained to the manager about my experience and he told that if I didn't like it, there were plenty of other bars in The Strip District.Please, please, please go somewhere else.Yuck!It's almost embarrassing having this place exist in the Strip with so many tourists coming here.  That has to be how they're making their money because it's certainly not on their food or service.  Well, maybe it's the booze too...I don't even know where to begin.  Service was horrible.  The lunch took 2 hours.  On a leisurely Sunday that may be fine, but there was no leisure.  At least not with drinks not in hand until a 1/2 an hour after we sat down.  I'd say lunch was served another 1/2 to 45 minutes later.  It didn't matter though, I knew it wasn't going to be anything spectacular.  I'd heard rumors about the food.  I won't go into any details but I wouldn't trust some items on the menu.  I just played it safe and ordered a veggie salad.  The salad was in the entree section, so I assumed it would be a full size salad.  It was not.  It was a side salad with a handful of grilled veggies on top.  Nothing spectacular.  And a side salad at almost $11.  Not worth it.  If you are forced to stop in because you're dying of hunger, stick to a liquid diet:)Friends warned me not to eat here. Turns out they were GOOD friends. This was just awful, start to finish. Slow (pitiful) service, nasty food ( and we each sprung for the lobster roll -- if you can call it that!) and a generally miserable experience. And this was an early lunch with very few customers around. The only thing remotely redeemable was that we sat on the balcony overlooking Penn avenue and were entertained by the people below. People watching can be a blast. I wanted a draft beer and was told that "we don't serve draft beer upstairs". What??? There's a bar there!! Are you kidding me?? So water it was and that took a long time to arrive. And without straws - another wait after I had the audacity to ask for them.  The "lobster rolls" arrived and looked mighty meager. That's not a lobster roll!! But I pressed on. As I got it closer to my mouth there was a slight aroma. But press on. The "lobster" was sparse, tough, and flavorless. How often could you say that about lobster??? Exactly!! It must have been harvested years ago and waited for me to show up so it could make its way out of the freezer. At $15 each this falls clearly into the ripoff category.  And trying to get our check? Ridiculous. I won't be back. Ever.
The Capital Grille=Ok ok ok....yes, Capital Grille is 'spensive, and it's a upscale chain but my oh my do I love it. I love the atmosphere, I love the steak, I love the Stoli Doli martinis, I love the cheesecake with the torched topping...what can I say, I'm a sucker for a great steak accompanied by great service. I only come to Cap Grille for special occasions, as it's certainly no cheap meal. Hubs and I can easily spend $150-$200 for a meal here (includes a few courses and adult beverages). Hence, during Charlotte's Restaurant Week(s) we always try to schedule in an affordable, delicious meal. The service here has been nothing but extraordinary every time I've walked in - whether I was just having a martini at the bar or a full-fledged meal al fresco. I'm a big fan of the shrimp cocktail - pretentious, sure, but it's composed of colossal shrimp and the perfect spicy cocktail sauce. Their filet is just so incredible, they have always cooked it exactly to my preferences, save one particular undercooked occasion which they immediately remedied with swift service and a very sweet apology. As for their sides, the asparagus w/Hollandaise, creamed spinach and potatoes au gratin will certainly stop your heart literally and figuratively. And last but not least, their desserts are just delectable. Per my opening remarks, their cheesecake is out of this world. It's a round, rich cheesecake with a semi-torched top and served with a smattering of fresh berries. YUM. Every time I leave Capital Grille I feel very full but very, very happy!I've been dying to come here to get my steak on, but the menu prices are downright daunting! This time around we made reservations to partake in their Restaurant Week menu, and it is the most affordable way to experience one of the better restaurants in the area.The Capital Grill may be a chain, but it definitely doesn't feel like it. From the interior decor to the service to the actual food, everything screams upscale fancy-smancy...not something that is usually associated with a chain. We made reservations (highly recommended) and were seated almost immediately.Our server was very friendly and brutally honest. I guess she was forced to try to upsell us a $17 glass of wine but then told us how ridiculous it is and we shouldn't bother with it. When we did choose a bottle of wine she detoured us to a different bottle that was the same price but was more well-received. I'm glad we went with her recommendation because it ended up being an awesome bottle that we would have overlooked otherwise. For the first course of the Restaurant Week menu I had the New England Clam Chowder. I am a sucker for clam chowda and this stuff was great. It wasn't overly heavy with cream and had a ridiculous amount of succulent clam chunks in it. This chowda definitely didn't skimp on the seafood, and the clams, potatoes and bacon were all melded nicely for some of the best I've had in awhile. The missus got the field green salad which was very nice, and came with an excellent champagne dressing that worked very well with the veggies. I was almost a little jealous of her salad, but I had chowder in front of me, so that feeling didn't last long.The Restaurant Week menu was decent for entrees, with a few steak options as well as a chicken and salmon. I ordered the 14oz bone-in sirloin and this was one of the most magnificent steaks I've had in the Queen City. It was cooked to a perfect medium rare just as I ordered it, and it was a tender, juicy, tasty steak with an excellent beef flavor. It was such a huge steak that I only ate half and saved the rest for a leftover dinner the next night! The missus had the Citrus Glazed Seared Salmon. It was a very nice piece of salmon that wasn't overpowering, and the glaze was really tasty. Her plate also came with some roasted asparagus that were cooked perfectly and had a nice sauce drizzled on top. Our table was also served shared side dishes of mashed potatoes and green beans. The potatoes were crazy rich, creamy and delicious, and there were still a few nice lumps mixed within the majority of the velvety mass, making these potatoes freaking awesome. The green beans were also tasty, and were tossed with tomatoes to give it a little extra pop.For dessert we both shared the Cheesecake and Flourless Chocolate Espresso Cake. The cheesecake was actually more like a mousse, and so it was light as opposed to dense. It tasted wonderful and the top is caramelized to give it a crisp bite. It was served alongside a few berries and strawberry glaze, which made one delicious mouthful. The chocolate cake was just as good, if not slightly better. The espresso flavor is very light so if you're not a coffee fan don't be afraid to give this a whirl. The consistency of the cake was more like a chewy fudge, making it extremely decadent. The Capital Grill is the place to go, so long as you have to cash. The food is all excellent and I would love to go back and try some other stuff out. The ambiance, service and food all scream swank, and it definitely feels like it warrants the extravagant price tag.It's not normally like me to eat at a steak house, or a chain at that, and it's certainly not like me to give a chain steakhouse a 5 star rating.  But I definitely tip my cap to Cap Grille.  It's obvious why Consumer Reports rated it the #1 chain in the country.  Sure it's expensive, but the quality of the service and food is superb.  I had met someone there for a "business" lunch so we were both wearing black slacks - immediately after being seated the host handed us black napkins so that we wouldn't get any white fuzz on our slacks. (Brilliant!) The waiter was very friendly and described all of the options for us in great detail.  We started with the calamari which was outstanding - it blew me away that seafood could be so good in the desert (it had probably come in on the same flight I did from Boston)!  We both had 10oz sirloin steaks encrusted in ground decaf Kona coffee with a butter sauce.  Exquisite.  The waiter and bus boys were very attentive the whole meal.  I didn't find cap grille to be pretentious at all.  I mean, all of the patrons wearing suits and it cost us $60pp incl tax and tip for an app, an entree, and a drink.  So if that is pretentious (and people seem to think that is what makes a place pretentious) then fine.  But I didn't find anyone to be super snotty or rude - the service was impeccable. I would definitely go back here or to any other location, but only for an extra special occasion or if I can claim it as a business expense and get reimbursed!Huh.  Dang.  Darn it.  Shoot.  I was really looking forward to lunch here.  Parking at this location is beyond ridiculous, no, I didn't valet cause I wanted to shop after wards.  But who cares?  I was here for a great meal!  Things started off well, great folks at the hostess desk.  Attractive interior, beautiful dark rich woods, attractive lighting, dark plantation blinds, very nice table.  My server Paula was extremely nice and had the cutest accent.  I liked a lot of the choices on the menu, but on an impulse, decided on the salad with filet medallions and onions straws.  The first bite of steak was extraordinary, perfectly cooked, wonderful seasonings and flavor.  Fresh pieces of asparagus in the salad was a nice surprise.  Then the shocker.  The next medallion was under cooked, the next was over cooked and the rest were grisley.  Needless to say, I could not eat it.  My server was very apologetic.  And then the manager immediately appeared as if he had been shot out of a canon.  He apologized profusely.  I was very understanding, I mean everyone has a bad day, right?   And of course he offered another dish, but I declined.  I mean, the mood was gone.  But then again, this is why I don't eat at home. The salad was taken off my check, as should be expected.  I did have dessert, hell yes, I was still hungry!  I got the hazelnut chocolate cake, which was totally awesome and even pretty to look at.  It was big enough to feed an army, don't know if it was a regular slice or if they were trying to make up for the salad.  So, a really mixed review.  I will try Capital Grill, again.  And I hope to have much better results.9/22Came to try their Restaurant Week menu, and sat at one of the tables at the bar section of the restaurant.  I liked its subdued and quaint atmosphere; however, the smooth jazz music's volume was turned up significantly as the afternoon turned into dusk.  It's a good thing I enjoy smooth jazz.Chose the French onion soup starter, the Kona-crusted sirloin steak entree, and cheesecake w/ fresh berries sauce to finish.  I really enjoyed the onion soup- salty from the cheese, yet just enough sweetness from the caramelized onions.  I really liked how some areas of the cheese that blanketed the bowl were crispy!  I thought perhaps it was the bread that sometimes one would find below the cheese, but no, it was the cheese itself.  Wished the whole piece was crunchy...I absolutely adored the Kona-crusted sirloin.  Cooked to medium- perfect!- and I could taste the coffee, too, and not just feel the texture of coffee grains, as I've ordered similar entrees from other venues, but never tasted the intended effect.  The caramelized shallot cream sauce absolutely floored me!  One of the best sauces that has graced my lips :)  Mmm... The entree came with two standard sides (no substitutes allowed, or at least that was what I was told) of creamed spinach and smashed red potatoes.  Both were delightful- decadently rich and creamy.  Before I forget, the table bread basket (seeded dinner rolls and lavosh) was good, especially the seeded rolls.  You may also order toasted sourdough if you have food allergies to avoid.Stepping back down, but not much, from the piece de resistance (in this meal, the standout was the steak), was the creme brulee cheesecake w/ berry sauce w/ fresh berries!  Simply incredible!   While I had to return the more beautiful (more caramelized sugar crust) first offering, untouched, due to food issues, the second was less visually stunning, but tasted divine.  I should've asked for more sauce on the side, as I ended up taking some home.  (Believe me, it took all of my willpower to stop myself from inhaling the whole dish!)I would definitely love to go back again!I visit this Capital Grille location several times a year... usually for some kind of work meeting or special occasion.  While my visits can cost a pretty penny, I've never been disappointed.  Most recently I was at TCG for a Master Wine Tasting event, which was a great deal... and it's a promotion that is taking place at dinner time now through our crazy Summer (ending September 5th).For $25 per person, TCG offers generous pours of up to 11 wine selections.  We sampled quite a variety of vino: sparkling, red, and white, from Napa Valley, Italy, and New Zealand.  I'm no wine connoisseur, but I enjoyed them all! And for $40 more, ($65 total), TCG does a food pairing to go with the wine selections. On the night we were there, our courses included Lobster and Crab Cake, Pan-Fried Calamari, Cedar Planked Salmon,Lamb Chop, Sirloin, and Flourless Chocolate Espresso Cake.Not the healthiest meal, but it sure was a foodie experience!  My favorites were the calamari and the flourless chocolate cake.  The rest of the group I dined with enjoyed it all as well... You cannot go wrong with escaping the heat this summer and spending an evening at The Capital Grille with their special tasting menus!How have I not written a review for The Capital Grille until now? Three words: Coconut Cream Pie. I'm not even a fan of coconut or these types of desserts, but whatever they put in this dessert is addicting. It's the combination of creamy coconut filling, with a flaky yet soft crust and then the very best part is the caramel. I could eat an entire serving on my own. So whatever you do, don't stuff yourself too much on the delicious steak so you miss out on this dessert!Now on to the rest of the meal. This Capital Grille has a great location, very friendly staff and a great environment...not to mention the amazing food! Not only do they have a large selection of comfortable booths, but they also have a private room in the back that's perfect for hosting a large group. I've been to a luncheon in the private room before and it was very comfortable. The steak here is top quality and fresh! It's tender to the touch and better with each bite. I absolutely love their Lobster Mac N Cheese along with their Au Gratin potatoes. Get both and happily roll out of their like I do! My favorite meal consists of a the Capital Grille chopped salad, the Filet Oscar (topped with crab meat), sharing the Lobster Mac and Au Gratin and completing the gluttonous experience with the Coconut Cream Pie. It's worth every calorie and then some. Important Notes:- They serve lunch and often do amazing three course lunch specials. - During the summer, they do dining after dark which means they offer a special prix fix menu starting after 8 PM that includes an appetizer, two entrees, two drinks and dessert all for $50!- Make a reservation, especially on weekends and during the busy season. A special fun fact: - I learned an amazing piece of information about their giving. Every day, they give away all the left over food to a local charity, so no food goes to waste!Review on The Capital Grille bar:The bartenders here know how to make mean drinks, but it's the Stoli Doli that is an absolute must! They even showcase the pineapple slices soaking in vodka right on the counter, it's beautiful as it is refreshingly, delicious! They serve food at the bar, but my favorite appetizer thus far is the Pan-fried Calamari it's the perfect savory, spicy, fried treat to pair with a cool chilled drink!The service is always great, bartenders are easy to talk to and never pushy. The ambience of the bar is like that of the restaurant, it's dark and laid back. An absolutely great way to spend an evening or for a quick drink.
Pancho's Mexican Buffet=OK. Do not judge me. Do not send me scornful, hurtful messages. And do not preach to me the hazards, both socially and physically, of eating at buffets. Because, frankly, I've done that to myself already. Eating at Mexican buffets was part of the bf's growing up days in San Antonio. One day he asked me to go, and since he's irresistible to me, I said yes. Upon entering Pancho's, I realized it was like a Mexican Chuck E Cheese. More kids than you'd find at Mia Farrow's house. Running in between and around my legs. Screaming, laughing, crying. Totally out of control. And this is all while we're standing in line. Suddenly I find my throat to be dry, irritated and burning. Why is there a white haze wafting from the hallway? Oh. Some darling little child had activated the FIRE EXTINGUISHER! Yea. And mommy was too busy ordering her Dos XX to notice. You'd think this would have sent us running. But we persevered. I thought I'd be safe and get a taco, enchilada with beans and rice. All were simply horrific. Malo. Horrible. No bueno. The more I recall this day, the more I feel a need for a buffet support group of some kind. Hello, my name is Thomas. I ate at Pancho's. HELLO THOMAS! Good bye Panchos.Aye, Pancho's!   When you're good, you're very, very good, but when you're bad, you're horrid!Okay, so here's the secret to a potentially enjoyable, or at least tolerable, dining experience in a cheap ass dive of a restaurant:Go knowing it'll suck.  Go because it is a consistent suck, and the suck you know is better than the suck you don't.You may end up pleasantly surprised.  Happens to me all the time.(If you don't expect it to taste like a PIZZA at all, a Totino's frozen cracker with sauce and toppings can actaully be a little tasty.)Pancho's has all that I love in a cheapo boofay.  There's a lot of variety to choose from, and of course, as much as you can stuff in your gullet.  They even have the added benefit of a server to bring you your seconds and beyond.  I just wish the food was more consistent.If you go on a day that the cooks know what they're doing with the fryer, it makes all the difference in the world.  There are a lot of items that are cooked that way - chicken taquitos, turkey flautas, tortilla chips, sopaipillas, etc - that are so good when they achieve the proper consistency on the delicate "Crispy~Greasy Spectrum", but so nasty when they are not.The salsas are actually pretty good.  They have a few from which to choose, from mild and tomatoey to a chunky&HOT roasted number.  They used to have one of the better tomatillo salsa verdes I've had, but I don't think they make it anymore.Your best bet seems to be to avoid the busiest times with the most children.  Lunch or late weeknights should be okay.  Unless you're bringing a group of kids, who should LOVE IT here.On bad days, it's easily a 1, but on good days it can be a 3.5, so I'm going with a rating of 3, as long as you go knowing what to expect.To a realist, the glass is always full - half with water, half with air.  I eat at crappy places and enjoy it.Stone me.I had not expected anything fabulous.  It is what it is.  Cheap, not steller, food.  But quick and kinda cool that you can choose whatever you like and then YOU don't have to go back for more, your wait person will do it for you.  You just ttell them what you want and they will get it.  So if all you like here are tacos....just gorge yourself on tacos!  It's really not a bad  deal and if you have a family with teenagers who want to eat everything in site...well, here is the place for you!  The place was clean although I did not use the restroom so I can't comment on that.  I spoke with the manager as we were leaving and he was very personable and seemed open to constructive critisism.  Apparently he just took over.  So, if you go knowing this is not going to be the best mexican food in town, then it's fine.  Not a bad value.  Thanks Panchos.
Carpe Diem=Possibly the best kept vegetarian secret in Charlotte.Went for a "romantic" birthday dinner. He had reserved the table thru their website, leaving "birthday" in the comments- and they'd sprinkled the table (really sweet, sits in an alcove, isolated and quiet) with balloon confetti. Great little touch.From door to check, the service was impeccable, (thanks Page!) without being stuffy. The wine we'd wanted to try wasn't in stock any longer, so we were given a perfectly chilled taste of the new pinot grigio they're carrying before making our decision. Great wine, decent price.The decor was so Art Nouveau it was leaning towards camp - but I love anything from that era, so that was fine by me. Delicate lighting, warm and comfy. This is their third? relocation - and it looks as though they're planning to stay awhile, as there is obviously a lot of time, thought and money invested in the decor. Nice space between tables, a variety of seating options, lovely. I wonder if they'd be better placed Uptown, since the surrounding restaurants are a little lower-key, but I'm totally cool with not having to deal with all that entails to come here.The food ranged from good to impressive. Our mushroom tart with beets and microgreens was the low point of the meal, but was still delish. Grilled grape salad was simple but impressive, surrounded by a white balsamic reduction so subtle that it was almost honey. This is the only high cuisine restaurant I know of in Charlotte that does a unique vegetarian main each night as a special - and at 16.50 for my cauliflower cream pot pie (topped by perfect puff pastry, made in-house) it's accessible to anyone. I overheard other specials being ordered at double that price. But if you can stand to keep it veg, Carpe is an incredible bargain. Being the annoyingly inquisitive Yelper that I am, I had some questions involving hypotheticals - what if a troop of vegan friends were staying with me sometime in the future and I wanted to treat them to an amazing meal? Not a problem, said the chef - give me a week's notice, and I'll have a fully vegan experience prepared. Amazing.Not that I have any allergies or dietary restrictions (well, other than the veg thing), but this is the place to take relatives and friends that do. They are ready and willing to cater to any need. But you should come here anyway, although for us, it will be for special occasions. Our bill landed right at 100 for three courses, beverages, and tip. Easily worth it.Seize the day and get your hungry self over to Carpe Diem. While Carpe Diem is a little fancy pants to just roll into with jorts and a Dale Jr. tee, make the effort. It's a lovely restaurant- beautifully appointed and as Julia S points out - stellar service and impeccable pacing. I've taken many of visiting family members here and I've never had anything less than an extraordinary meal. It's not a cheap meal, but it's well priced for the quality and quantity. For two of us with a few courses and a bottle of mid-price wine we usually spend about $120-$150 (including tip). Some of my favorites...Warm Goat Cheese (salad): I mean, really, it's warm goat cheese over delicious greens with hazelnut crunch. It's so good you basically want to start fist pumping through the restaurant.Cheese Plate: A very generous and tantalizing plate of cheese of the day. As Julia said - the accompaniments make it stellar. Scallops: I've had them so many different ways here I can't even count. One time they had some vanilla essence another atop of risotto. Both times they were out of this world. Cooked and seasoned perfectly. Plus they give you a very generous portion of large scallops. YUM.Desserts: They special make their desserts daily and I wish I could remember what I've had here. I know I've had some delicious type of creme brulee and something uber chocolately. Regardless, I don't think anyone would be disappointed with their dessert selection!
Flying Saucer Draught Emporium=The best place to get a beer in Charlotte, period. I used to live right down the road from the Saucer and went there several times a week in order to earn my own gold plate up on the wall (something you get after drinking 200 different beers). The selection is unmatched in the Charlotte area, and the wait staff is usually really knowledgeable about all the new beers they get in. Monday nights are $2.75 "pint nights" where everything on the wall (and we're talking nearly 100 beers here) is only $2.75, and considering the quality of some of these this is almost impossible to beat ANYWHERE!The glass program on Wednesday night is really cool, and if you go to their website there is even a big trading community so you can find some pretty cool stuff that the local one doesn't offer. The tracking system they use is actually really great too. It's awesome to be able to see every beer you've ever had there, including the date, and your rating and comments about it.The food at the bar is, well, bar food. If you're expecting something amazing for dinner here then you're definitely here for the wrong reason. While not quite as bad as you would expect, it's still the standard grease-laden goodies that just seem to go great with beer.The one detriment to this place for me was that they allow smoking inside. I would dock them a point for this normally, but the reasonable person in me still realizes that it is a bar, and it is in NC, so it's almost allowable. The saving grace is that there is a great patio outside where you can go if cancer isn't your thing.One final personal note: if you come here and order Bud Light (or some other equivalent) you're wasting space and need to be eradicated.Very unusual GastropubI'm running behind and actually thought I had already posted this review but apparently I did not. Back in May, two of my friends from Ohio went to the 300 race at Charlotte Motor Speedway and had dinner here afterwards.It's a nice place with good service and a somewhat whimsical menu.  Main selling point is their Saucer Club where you consume 200 different beers or ales and you get a Saucer with your name on it mounted on the walls or ceiling.  Considering the number of different bottled beers and ales and the broad selection on tap which changes weekly, not hard to have two hundred different one.Food is a bit of an afterthough but what they do have is very good. I have the Reuben-esque, while my friends had a Saucer Dipster and the Chicken Sandwich. The Chicken Sandwich sound plain but with the bacon, guacamole, pepper jack cheese, etc, is anything butRoom is like an old pub with the exception of the several hundred Saucers on the Walls and Ceiling from those who have come before and have been sucessful
Mert's Heart & Soul=We've been living in Charlotte for a year now, and we've been to quite a few restaurants in our time. However, while I have found that perfect BBQ joint I dreamed of, I had not yet happened across the quintessential place for good ol' Southern cooking...in particular fried chicken. Well, that is now a thing of the past, for I have found Merts.You could tell just from walking inside that it was going to be a great Southern food experience. The interior of the restaurant is colorful and eye-catching, and the art and decor screams Southern. The interior was full to capacity, but we were able to snag a table outside. The outdoor area is a mixed bag. While it's nowhere near as crowded as inside (with only four tables or so) the Charlotte pedestrians take it upon themselves to walk through the outdoor area. It was a bit disruptive to be eating a nice meal while people constantly walked right against your table. I wasn't a fan of the beer list since Merts does not carry any drafts, so I stuck with unsweet tea. After placing our orders the server came over with a small loaf of cornbread for each of us. This cornbread was spot on for me! Not gritty, a little sweet and extremely crumbly. You could tell it was fresh from the oven, and that made it super awesome!For dinner I ordered the beef ribs and leg quarter fried chicken combo. I wasn't crazy about the ribs themselves, as they were a bit tough and chunks of bone kept flaking off. I did enjoy the sauce, as it was a sweet and tangy sauce and not vinegary. Now the chicken was THE BOMB! I've been searching for fried chicken down here, and have been disappointed time and again. So far I am confident to say that Merts has the best fried chicken (though I haven't made it over to Price's yet, so don't jump on me for that yet.) The battered skin was light and crisp, and not greasy. The interior was that moist and juicy you expect from fried chicken. I was in heaven scoffing that chicken down, and I wish I had more right now! The miss' ordered the catfish and fried chicken breast combo, and that was also pretty dang awesome. The catfish was a huge filet just plopped on the plate. The meat came right off and was so light and tasty. The batter was also perfect, with not too much that didn't take away from the soft flavor of the fish. They serve it with this spicy sauce that was a good compliment to the fish. The chicken breast was just as good as my leg. Even the white meat stayed juicy and tender! The miss' didn't eat too much of it after filling up on the fish, so there are plenty of chicken leftovers in my future!The other thing that Merts does damn good is sides. One problem I've had at BBQ and other places down here is that the meats are perfect, yet the sides are extremely lacking. Merts has some of the best dang sides money can buy. We both ordered the mac & cheese and it was simply the best I've had down here. Some places I've been to make it watery or oily or just not flavored right, but Merts had it all. It was a firm consistency with a great cheesy flavor, and the cheese crust on top was awesome. I also tried black eyed peas for the first time and loved them. They were cooked perfectly and were served in this kind of gravy that was also tasty. The miss' ordered the collard greens and I have to say that I liked those too. I'm generally not a fan of collards as they are bitter, but these were cooked in such a way that the bitterness was taken down a notch or two. They had some citrus flavoring to them that helped tone it down and added a different level of flavor to. All in all, the sides kicked butt! Unfortunately we were so stuffed from this massive meal that we did not stick around for dessert.I have to say, when I think home cooked Southern fare, I will always associate it with Merts. They can fry up some mean chicken and fish, and their sides and veggies are top notch. It's a busy place but it is definitely worth the trip.Mert's is one of those go-to, Charlotte staple, consistently filling, always busy, and good-luck-finding-a-seat kind of spots you can't miss if you're a regular diner around town. Even if you're in town for an extended stay, Mert's should fall on your radar within in the first few days. Where I'm not a huge soul/comfort food goer on the regular, the fried chicken, fried catfish, mac n' cheese and other sides have all sang beautifully upon my many visits. One thing that sticks out more frequently and consistently beckons my palate is the lemonade. Goodness gracious, it's that good. Sometimes, I think of stopping in just for a big glass to go. One thing to keep in mind about Mert's is that it functions quite differently than other Uptown culinary hearths. This place is busy throughout the week and the weekends. Not uncommon for them to be on a wait well into a Sunday afternoon. Plan accordingly, should you find yourself visiting during any "peak" hour. Service is ever-so friendly and I love the "shoe art(?)" in the men's bathroom. Kind of odd, but definitely worth a gander if you've never seen it. Mert's, thank you. Just...for everything.This review I would say would be a pretty weak 4 star.First time here. I was in town for a conference and me and my friends just did Crossfit so I asked the concierge at my hotel to direct me to a place where I can get my grub on... He asks like chicken and stuff? I said like Mac and cheese and ribs and all that Good stuff lol and this is where it brought me.It's a small southern comfort food style place. My expectations ran high as I saw Guy Fieri "was here". Plus who could go wrong with comfort food right?The restaurant hours didn't close till about half an hour after we walked in.And one of the waiters didn't want to sit us in his area because he didn't want to serve any more tables on his side. Well thanks Pal. The restaurant really isn't that big.Anywhooooo...We ordered and our waitress was kind of snappy. I guess she was overwhelmed and tired that day that she wanted to close the restaurant already. I wanted to order the ribs with Mac and cheese and string bean. But the waitress informed us there wasn't anymore. Okay... How about the corn on the cob? We're out of that too. As I grew frustrated and hungry, I just opted out totally off the second side dish. Out of everything , I was looking forward to the Mac and cheese more than anything.Our cornbread came right away, served nice and warm. delicious! But our entrees took a while.Then a miracle happened! The kitchen staff was so kind enough to make a batch of fresh Mac and cheese. Praise the Lord!And purely because of that reason, I gave them one extra star for that really kind gesture.Our food came and it really was a mouthful. My ribs was DROWNED in sauce and oil. Tasted good like any other ribs to me. Mac and cheese was great. String bean was really soggy . I don't know if it should look like that on purpose.Price is around $8 and up and they do have combos.Personally, I didn't think this place was that special. Just a good Comfort food place that's all.Recommend for a grub.
It's Greek To Me=so i'm greek and every time i go here, i get yelled at for not coming in all the time.  honestly, when i want greek food, either i make it myself or i go to mom's house and just have to say, "ma, i'm hungry." and boom, there's a plate in front of me.that aside, this place is about as family style greek cooking as it gets.  it does taste like what i grew up eating.  the spanakopita is flaky, buttery and moist as it should be.  melts in your mouth.  the dolmathes are very rich and with a good splash of lemon juice taste great.  i havent been there in some time so i'm not sure if he's still serving falafel but when he did, damn it was good.  some of the best i've had, period.  but the gyros are where it's at.  i can only have one of these every so often or i think my heart may come to an arresting halt.  there's just a ton of lamb falling out of the pita and there is no sexy way to eat it so you end up looking like a bulldog eating a jar of mayonnaise.hit this place if your an ethnic foodie.  you wont be disappointed.  even when the owner yells at you for not coming in all the time.
Salute Ristorante Italiano=It had fallen off my radar a bit, but I came for dinner earlier this week. Got the pasta with clams. Holy Moley! I've never seen so many tiny little clams! ($21 - See the photo!) Four in the shell and countless baby clams complimented by leeks and garlic.By the time I had finished the pasta, there was still a bed of clams on my plate! I got a to go container for the little buggers and figure I'll add them to some sauce and pasta at home for round 2!Entrees come with salad and bread.Salute means cheers and, lucky for us, they have some delicious wines to say it with!
Crepes Parisiennes=Unless you've been here before, let me warn you about the "unspoken house rules": 1. Order first (do not try and sit down).2. Wait for your food while standing.3. Find a seat (if one is available).Under no circumstances should you sit down before placing an order. And if the place is full, don't try and sit down without food in your hands, unless you want to be made an example of.My wife and I (who frequent restaurants several times a week) have never experienced anyone quite as rude as the woman behind the counter at this place.  We had never been here before and when we walked in, my wife sat down at a table and I went up to place our order.Little did I know the house rules (see above) and after the people in front of me ordered, the obnoxious cashier pointed to our table and to another table (of newbies) and said to the person who just placed the order: "you can either sit there or there", with the tact of, say, General Patton. She never asked us to get up or explained the "unwritten rules" to us.  An "excuse me, but you need to order first before you sit down" would have sufficed.So, my wife got up and we walked out of this place. The food could very well be good - but with waitstaff like this woman - there are plentty of other places around town with not-so crummy service that I'd prefer to spend my money.The crepes served by this establishment might very well be the culinary embodiment of a mind-exploding, toe-curling, orgasm.  I say, "might be" because on my recent (and last) trip there I didn't have an opportunity to sample them.  In fact, I didn't eat anything at all.Please let me explain.The restaurant is located in the basement of a building off of Walnut Street.  Customers are expected to wait in a line that stretches from the entrance, through the main dining area, to a counter where the crepes are ordered and cooked.  It's a horrendous setup for multiple reasons.  First, there aren't many tables.  When I went there on a Saturday morning, there were at least 20 people standing in line for the ten or so small tables.  Second, the restaurant expects you to wait in line, standing next to tables of patrons who are eating their food, until a table becomes free.  At that point, the woman at the counter takes the next order, a man begins preparing the crepes, and the front of the line is seated while everyone else continues to wait.  Those who have waited long enough, are finally able to sit, while hungry and impatient diners-to-be stand next to their table and wait some more.It's a horrible atmosphere, and not one conducive to a pleasant dining experience.The dining space is poorly designed, so that the line of waiting patrons snakes directly though the middle of the cramped dining area.  Which means that when you are waiting, you are continually bumped by servers shuttling food to the tables and dirty dishes back to the kitchen.  When you are eating, you are likely to: 1) have a bunch of hungry people staring at you eat, waiting for you to leave your table, so that they may be seated; and/or 2) have a standing person's ass within a few inches of your head.  What a great dining atmosphere!What's all the more annoying is the lackadaisical work ethic of the people who prepare the crepes.  More than once during my wait, the man making the crepes just stood around, not making any food, waiting for another table to open, so a party's order could be taken, and he could then prepare the next order.  After waiting 15-20 minutes while hungry, becoming increasingly annoyed at being bumped at least 2 dozen times by serves traversing the line, and then seeing the owner stop making food until another order was taken, I said to myself, "enough of this nonsense".My party and I left to go to another restaurant.  I've not eaten any crepe in the world that would justify a long wait under such annoying circumstances, and I will not be back.
Super Dragon=Super Dragon's main menu is filled with Americanized Chinese food which I ignored as soon as I saw the single page laminated menu in pure Chinese.  The two dishes we ordered were delicious and reminded me of food cooked at my grandma's house in Hong Kong.The Chinese menu is filled mainly with Cantonese food except for the obligatory Peking duck.  We ordered the bitter melon stir-fried with 3 kinds of diced eggs (salted duck eggs, preserved eggs and regular eggs).  The hints of bitterness nicely balanced the creaminess of the preserved eggs and savoriness of the salted eggs.The weather was cold so we wanted a braised dish served in a hotpot.  We ordered the mixed veg with dried shrimp and vermicelli (aka mung bean thread) in hotpot.  What came instead of the vermicelli was black moss and the addition of tofu, which was not mentioned.  We didn't mind because we really liked the dish esp the black moss which is a more expensive and rare ingredient.  The flavors were spot on, well-balanced and very comforting.I'm guessing that food from the Chinese menu is so rarely ordered that the kitchen confused what I ordered with another vegetarian dish on that menu.  I need to find out the name so that I can order it again.It's a shame that Super Dragon doesn't offer the authentic Chinese menu in English as well.My roommate and I live in this part of town, so we decided to eat here this evening. It's definitely a fabulous place to get some Chinese food.  The place has  a great family atmosphere, and the food is delectable. Portions are huge, so you get a good value for money especially the set lunch option. If you're not in the mood for going out, they also provide a delivery service. I'm giving them 5 stars because I'm a generous reviewer especially if the service is friendly, courteous, and fast.
Yoshi's Restaurant=Still trying to find my go-to noodle bowl place after visiting Yoshi's. This place looked dive-ish, but some of the best dishes come from places that look just like this. We went through the drive-thru around 8pm last Wednesday. The inside looked closed as the chairs were all stacked on the tables, but the drive-thru was buzzing. My friend and I both got the Yakisoba noodle bowl with chicken. I also ordered an order of Gyoza. Both bowls and Gyoza came to $11.00 with tax. Pretty decent prices I thought. We got back to my house, opened up the white wine, and camped out on the couch with our dinners. The sauce was pretty good- kind of a citrus soy. The noodles were good, even if average. Veggies and chicken were okay too. I guess the whole bowl was just okay. I was really craving the noodles and it shouldn't be hard to make good noodles at a Noodle place. The Gyoza were alright too- kind of crunchy around the edges. The sauce served with them were good though. All in all, not my dream dinner, but just okay. Would probably drive-thru again if I was in the area and didn't feel like cooking that night.
Mim's Burger & Mexican Food=You gotta try Mim's Burger & Mexican Food for lunch if you haven't tried them already!  This is a little "hole in the wall" place located very close to the airport.  Catching an afternoon flight out to "BFE" from Sky Harbor the other day I decided to give Mim's Burger & Mexican Food a try. I was greeted by this very friendly man, the owner I believe, who was doing everything from taking orders to cooking and cleaning.  This place is bigger on the inside than what it looks like from the outside.  It's "dive-ee" inside too, but its clean and he has some really cool retro video games and a couple of pinball machines :^)I ordered a double cheese burger with a side of fries.  He fried the fries fresh and I watched him cook the burger.  Everything he makes is homemade and taste very good.  This is another one of those places "you can't judge a book by it's cover", so stop in see what's available inside.  Mim's is a great place for lunch if your on your way to/from the airport.  I'm looking forward to trying his fried fish or maybe even his BBQ brisket on my next visit!
Cafe Zinho=This is the kind of restaurant that I deeply appreciate.  Family-owned.  Off the main roads.  Charming interior.  Unique staff.  WONDERFUL FOOD.  (We called this our "less-expensive Casbah" when we left).Like everywhere we end up going, we go because a Yelp review we have read, that inspired us to give it a try.  We new it was BYOB, but we weren't in the mood for drinking, so we walked on over.  It was our own fault that we got there, at 5:00pm, on the dot - and they were not quite ready to be opened, as they were finishing setting up the tables.  My boyfriend and I took a quick walk around Ellsworth.  It's a family-owned business where they turned their front garage into the most charming, artsy-like, romantic restaurant.  We'll cut them some slack!When we got back, they were ready for us; and we chose to snag a table outside (they thought we were nuts).  However, in one of the reviews, we read that they had no A/C, which was a big selling point for us (I absolutely loathe going into a freezing cold, A/C'd out restaurant, and being forced to bring a hoodie with me, when it's 90+ outside.  And we do kind of like hot, humid, and muggy); but, I guess they have upgraded because the A/C was BLASTING on the inside of the restaurant.We started off with the Gazpacho.  This was a perfect summer starter because it was cool, extremely flavorful, and a natural air conditioner to the body.  It had lumps of shrimp and crab meat at the bottom, which made us feel like we were eating somewhere on Duval St. in Key West.  I normally don't like cilantro, but the cilantro was so subtle and completely rounded out the flavor.  When our waitress brought out the freshly baked loaf of corn bread, we sopped up the rest of it.  It is true, the wait staff genuinely appreciates your compliments and feels honored every time you say you enjoyed something.I ordered the Wild Mushroom Ravioli and my boyfriend ordered the Lamb Burger.  When our dishes came out, they were the most beautiful dishes I had ever seen - full of color, wonderful portion sizing, and aromas just attacking the olfactory with sensational goodness.  My Ravs were topped with this grape tomato paquillo sauce, which tasted like it had hints of red pepper also.  It was FANTASTIC.  Plus, there were whole mushrooms, okra, carrots, and cauliflower on top of the dish as well.  I don't know what kind of separate seasonings were on the veggies, but they were to-die-for also.  I can't exactly remember how many Ravs were in my bowl, but every time I thought I was finished, there was another ravioli to be found, and then another.  For the price - I think there were a total of 10 fully-stuffed, hand-made mushroom ravs.  Incredible.My boyfriend's Lamb Burger came with a cranberry and raisin jam (but "jam" seems to cliché of a word for this topping), and a salad that had slices of apples in it.  Now I'm usually not one to eat sweeter tasting foods; however, the complementing of sweet and savory in this dish blew my mind.  I'm also not a big fruit eater (unless it's blended in a smoothie), but I totally got past all that because the flavors and the textures all are playing nicely with one another.We opted out of dessert because we were so stuffed.  But our bill for an appetizer and two filling, insanely delicious entrees came to $40.  DING DING DING DING DING!  WE HAVE FOUND A WINNER!  After dinner the owner came over to our table and we were introduced.  What a wonderful, sweet, and genuine older guy.  We will definitely be back before the menu changes again; and next time, we're going for entrees and dessert!! One last thing - it is a Cash Only restaurant, but they do have an ATM on-site.
Savannah Red=Yep, another 5 star on my list of stuff here. So this was the place that I wanted to visit for my birthday dinner. My husband didn't complain, not one bit. That was part of the deal. I am pretty sure that he wasn't complaining, not because he wasn't allowed but because he really enjoyed the night! One of the first things that came out to the table was these Delicious little corn bread rolls with kudzu flower butter. You know, kudzu, that shit vine you cannot kill even by setting your yard on fire? Yeah, that plant. Well apparently the flower is really sweet and some genius decided to flavor some butter with it. NCDOT, here is your sign. So, rolls--check. Delish. Then, my drink came out. I guzzled my gin and tonic and became a wildly appropriately drunk. I mean, come on, it was my birthday--and the entire staff knew it. Dan ignored me during these first few intolerable moments, then he just gave up and enjoyed his dinner. I started off with this lobster puff pastry thing that was served with a side of saffron ice cream. Dan referred to it as the "lobster ice cream thing." He eye humped my food until I gave him a taste. Then he just stole it. It was that good. Dan had cold soup, which just that day, Michelle and I talked about how she wasn't a complete fan of cold soup, but to my surprise, Dan ate the whole bowl and wiped the bowl clean with the extra corn bread thing. We swapped plates because I wanted to have some too. I am sure the waiter was totally confused when he picked up the plates. He probably questioned himself the rest of the night wondering if he made a mistake in who was supposed to get what dish. I didn't tell or correct him. I let him wonder. I was drunk, please remember this was funny at the time. Then came my pork tenderloin with peach schnapps topping, collard greens and cornbread cakes. Wow. Not just good, fan-effing-tastic! Dan had the fillet. Fresh garlic and mushrooms. I had some of his too. It was effing delish too! Then, we had the "cleansing of the palate" raspberry sorbet. What a treat. I love ice cream if you haven't figured that out. I ate mine in little increments to make it last. Dan ate the whole thing in one bite. Then came the best part. Krispy Kreme bread pudding with Maker's Mark glaze, and it came to the table on FIRE! No candles needed here! I think it was about 27 dough-nuts packed into a little bread pudding upside down dish. Probably about 10,000 calories. But all worth it. I nearly licked the plate..rememeber, I was intoxicated. (and the fire had gone out by that time.)Dan had this chocolate banana puff pastry with rum ice cream. He didn't share with me. What a bastard. It looked good, and if it was any less than perfect he might have then shared it with me. So I guess his dessert was top notch. I would tell you how wonderful the bathrooms were or how pretty the soap was, or how clean the toilets were, however, I was wearing 6 inch heals that didn't really allow me to walk around that well, (again, insert intoxicated mentioning here...) I did however walk 7 blocks back to where we parked. Dan thought it would be nice to walk around after such a wonderful night. I would have let him carry me on his back, but my high cut dress would have shown off my goodies to everyone. And in my drunken state, I would have thought it was funny while Dan would be dying of shame in the corner. So I walked. Savannah Red was AWESOME!! Will most definitely return. I will use the valet service next time, and maybe get wildly INappropriate next time. Especially if I know that I don't have to walk far.I'm a bit embarrassed to admit that Savannah Red was actually an account of mine back when I used to sell wine, and I never actually knew what kind of food they served or what the inside of the restaurant even looked like. Since they were owned by the Marriott hotel that houses it, there wasn't much influence I could have over their wine list, and we already pretty much dominated it with some of our larger corporate profile wines. It's a shame really, because after dining there over the holidays I had a very good meal that would definitely warrant a second visit.Although the hotel was a bustle with energy after a recently ended football game (Meineke Car Care Bowl, or whatever the hell it's called now), the restaurant itself was virtually dead for dinner service on a Saturday night. This did give me a better chance to take in the surroundings, and notice the ornate chandelier (http://www.flickr.com/photos/wedoitforlove/4385725507/), along with a beautiful but non-functioning water display, and plates and silverware which seemed entirely too old-fashioned Southern elegant than necessary, including captain's chairs which didn't quite mesh with the tables. On the plus side, a virtually empty dining room caused service to be very attentive, and the food came out without delay.The chef decided to start out with an amuse bouche of crab stuffed pastry (http://www.flickr.com/photos/wedoitforlove/4386490332/) with a homemade remoulade sauce. It was interesting, because I honestly wasn't even expecting an amuse here, but it was a nice surprise. The remoulade was a bit weak (I tend to like a little more spice), but the crab was nice in texture and flavor. It didn't take me long after those 2 bites to dive right into the sweet cornbread biscuits, thanks to the very soft butter. The biscuits were delicious, and were it not for a huge food order coming, I could have easily downed a dozen right then.The first real course of the night was a lobster "cobbler", prepared as an étouffée inside a phyllo tart (http://www.flickr.com/photos/wedoitforlove/4385726467/), with a side of saffron ice cream and topped with fresh chive. This was very close to my favorite dish of the night. The lobster flavor was fantastic, and although the saffron ice cream seemed strange at this point in the meal it really paired well with the strong flavors of the main component. The phyllo was perfectly flaky and taken as a whole bite just melts in your mouth. The next starter, braised beef short ribs served over gingerbread cookies (http://www.flickr.com/photos/wedoitforlove/4386491172/) was a little more disappointing, but still decent. The sweetness of the cookies was too much, and didn't mix well with the soy in the beef glaze, but at least the meat was extremely tender.The soup course was next, and both options were frankly somewhat forgettable. The butternut squash soup (http://www.flickr.com/photos/wedoitforlove/4386491456/) was a bit bland, as it can often be, but usually chefs will do something the kick a little flavor in. Not so much here. But perhaps the biggest let down of the night was the pork belly stew (http://www.flickr.com/photos/wedoitforlove/4385727231/), which I had very high hopes for. It all became sort of a runny tomato mess, and the texture on the pork belly was very odd and somehow tough...almost like it had been in a freezer too long.After an intermezzo of chilled citrus sorbet, which acted as a wonderful palate cleanser, the main courses got them back on the road to redemption, both delivering solid flavors. The Scottish salmon (http://www.flickr.com/photos/wedoitforlove/4385727849/) was a very large portion, and cooked perfectly, flaking apart very nicely. The one downside was a general lack of seasoning in the dish, but at least the fish seemed pretty fresh so those flavors were enough to carry it as a whole. The duo of duck (http://www.flickr.com/photos/wedoitforlove/4385727613/), while looking a bit sloppy, was easily the best dish of the night, and something worth returning to Savannah Red to taste again. The breast portion was seared nicely, and very juicy, and the sauce on top really helped bring out the flavors of the meat as well as adding a hint of sweetness. The confit part was huge, as I would prefer it to be, and just fell apart under the fork, a really well cooked piece of meat.Since I've left Charlotte I'm a bit out of touch with the dining scene there, but it's nice to see good places like this still around, despite a very challenging location. Granted, most places would kill for the prime real estate downtown, but I have a feeling a lot of its presence is lost by the hotel towering above it, and a lobby that is completely distracting with all the other options. I love that they try to maintain some sense of Southern cuisine in their menu, and that every time I've checked the menu since dining there a year ago they are constantly updating it with new, fresh additions.Holy unprofessional, I wish they offered a free course called "server 101" because I fear our server cannot last in this industry much longer. I dare say she might have been the worst server I have ever experienced -and it actually blows my mind that she earns tips on a daily basis. She "greets" our table after 15 minutes of waiting in the lobby followed by 15 minutes of sitting at our table ...was the place slammed? No. Her greeting consisted of throwing her arms over the backs of our chairs and asking us if we'll buy her a shot of tequila.... then, when she took our order and her pen didn't work she turned around and threw it at the bar...nice.  She dropped two of our meals (a filet and salmon) and then came over and said "you heard that crash, that was your meal" ...I then politely told her that my rare steak looked more well and she then answered " well that's three people that have to wait for their meals...rolled her eyes and stormed off" ...nice.She then brings out the salmon...gosh that poor friend who ordered salmon. The first time it was served raw. Then she had to send it back yet again- the third time it was served without sauce. They finally just brought her out her sides to eat while she waiting for her dish since this was going on a 2. 5 hour meal at this point....nice. Everyone paid the full cost of their meal which was fine for me as steak is over/under cooked quite frequently but there really was no excuse for the salmon at that point - 3 times you blew it. To make matters worse our server tacked on her 20% at the end - of course, that's why her service sucked (to be frank), she knew all along she would be tipped- why try? Oh and at the end she exclaimed that in 20 minutes she would be drinking tequila, I had only hoped she saved enough for me...lord knows I needed it at that point!I will say the only reason I gave it two stars instead of one was that the manager brought me a complimentary dessert and glass of sparkling wine, for she seemed to be the only professional who cared about her guests and how they were treated. I know that problems with the meals are often not the fault of a server, but to be friendly, helpful, and in general apologetic ...or even sympathetic to your guests, well that is the job of the server, and she failed miserably.Disappointed is an understatement . I will not be back.
Eat'n Park=I like fast food as much as the next guy but I dont like these gimmick places. The food was fine. the service fine. It was normal and affordable. It was extactly what I thought it would be. Nothing went wrong. Everything turned out great.
Mariscos Playa Hermosa=Usually when I visit my family in Phoenix it takes what seems like a lifetime to find a place to eat that is not the tried, true, and tired.  Eating at this modest restaurant was the culinary highlight of my trip to Phoenix.  I implore all Phoenicians to frequent this establishment and your taste buds will thank you.For starters, the chips were wonderfully light and not too oily.  The chips come with two different types of salsa.  A red salsa with a little bit of a bite and a green avocado salsa that is mild with just the right hint of avocado. I ordered the shrimp in garlic sauce and the dish was sublime.  The shrimp were sauteed with red bell peppers and onions.  The vegetables were cooked perfectly - not too soft and not too crunchy.  The garlic sauce was wonderfully sweet and garlicky.  I couldn't get enough of it.My dining companions both ordered the Camarones Culichi.  This dish is freaking amazing!  It consists of shrimp cooked in a green tomatillo sauce and loaded with melted Manchego cheese.  The sauce is divine and words cannot describe it properly.  The perfect accompaniments to these dishes were Mexican Coca-Colas (Yay!), creamy beans topped with cheese, and white rice with vegetables.  The tortillas were right on and looked to be homemade.Leave behind the comfort of the fancy pants restaurants that the trendinistas like to go to and try something real.  You will not be sorry.I've been coming here for YEARS and just thought to review it?  WTF is wrong with me???????????????????????THIS is Mexican seafood.  I've been to other places and nothing compares!  I take a book, sit in back and people watch while creaming my "Make Me Yelp" panties as I eat my culichi.  It's D I V I N E!  Eat the shrimp with a fork but you sure as Hell better use a spoon to destroy the rest of the bowl and leave it clean!Everything is fresh and the wait staff is loaded with recommendations.  Ask, and ye shall find. The snapper Veracruz is so good I often order 2 and take one home.  The decor is fun - aquatic scenes that won't make you feel guilty for eating the seafood in front of you.  At Xmas they had a Santa at the door!  The people here a super-friendly!  They have their own parking lot.  You know it's a good place when yours isn't the fanciest car in the parking lot.  All kinds come here, despite the neighborhood not being the nicest in DoPho.  You can't miss it - even though I do pass it every time!  I think I'm too excited thinking of the shrimp culichi and my mouth is watering so much that I always manage to say "Crap, passed it again!"Go.  Just go to this place.  You won't be disappointed.  I swear.  And, you won't break the bank.Here in Phoenix I think that we are pretty lucky to have such diversity in each neighborhood. Particularly South Phoenix where you can find great Soul Food at Lolo's Chicken and Waffles, Pizza at Amano, and of course various different types and regions of Mexican food. When I say Mexican food I'm really referring to the sort of hole in the wall, real deal family owned operations that are all over the south side of Phoenix. So many of them dot each street corner and call like the Sirens of the night. Marisco's Playa Hermosa is exactly what I mean by this."We bring the sea to the desert" is their slogan and it's so true. Stepping inside you'll feel like you were just transported to Mazatlán, Mexico, the only things missing here is the ocean. The place is just splashed with bright colors with hand carved tables and birds with a welcoming and friendly staff. With so much to take in it's hard to focus on any one thing, though with so many bird carvings hanging from the ceiling I almost felt like I was in the Tiki Room at Disneyland, less the chatter of the birds of course. Chips and salsa at a Mexican restaurant can be a very good benchmark to judge the rest of your meal, Marisco's would have to be at the top of these tests. Their chips are slightly thick, warm and a little on the oily side, this way the salt can adhere well to them. Accompanying are 2 different salsa, red and green. The red has a certain sweet and hot bitterness that is tasty and even better when washed down with a cold beer. The green is made of creamy avocado and with a warm chip is absolutely delicious. Neither were very hot but that's the thing with real deal Mexican food, its not always hot and spicy. So you'll have no reason to expect the "burning ring of fire" the next day! With so many different and tasty sounding items to choose from, deciding was pretty tough as I really enjoy some good seafood. So imagine this, 8 large perfectly cooked shrimp, swimming in a creamy tomatillo and cilantro sauce, then topped with a sprinkling of cheese. If this sounds like something you would enjoy then go ahead and order the Camarones Culichi ($13.99). You will also get a basket of hot fresh corn or flour tortillas for dunking as well as rice, beans and a fresh lettuce salad dressed with lime juice. The beans have a nice texture with good flavor but the rice is nice! Well steamed and seasoned, the rice has a bright white color which might look bland, but after one bite you'll be wrapping it up in a hot tortilla and dunking it into the beans. The Mojarra Frita ($15), a fried whole fried fish, sounds and looks good, but decided to be more like a daddy's little girl and order something less involved. Crab Enchilada's ($13) are not only the house specialty but are good to the last bite. 3 corn tortillas over stuffed with sweet crab meat, rolled together with cheese and covered in a slightly spicy red sauce. Again with the rice, beans and salad this is a pretty large plate and for the money, a great value. The enchiladas were actually featured in Gourmet Magazine at one time, who knew?On the back of the menu you'll find a section called Camida Mexicana which are plates of regular Mexican fare such as burritos, taco's and fajitas. Not trying the Carne Asada Taco's ($6.99) would be a real shame since the meat is so tender and the flavor so beefy. A plate full of 3 tacos, double tortilla, chopped beef and onions, with rice and beans is both satisfying and ample. Douse the tacos with some of the guacamole salsa and you'll have a party on your plate! The Quesadilla ($7.99) is just cheese and a tortilla, while good it was quite ordinary. However the smell from the Fajitas De Pollo ($10.99) was amazing! I'll have those to myself next time!For dessert you can stick with maybe a Mexican Coke ($2) made with real sugar or a large glass of over ice Horchata ($2.50). Though for something more, the Flan ($4) was different than what you normally get. More cake like and dense than silky smooth, it was decent enough and a nice finish to so many savory dishes. Otherwise there aren't any other desserts offers, like you'll have room after such good sized portions anyway. Marisco's Playa Hermosa is a real gem and has the menu, friendliness and comfortable vibe to back it up. While the neighborhood feels a bit on the seedy side, as they say, nothing ventured, nothing gained?BEST MEXICAN FOOD EVER.Do not even look at the menu, people. Just order a Dos Equis and the Molcajete Caliente with verde sauce. My boyfriend and I found this place on the Yelp app, like most eateries we visited while in Phoenix. I cannot express how happy this place made us. We loved the restaurant, the service and the food so much that we actually came back and ate there again before heading to the airport.The Molcajete Caliente is $22 for two people. You each get your own ceviche tostada and plate of rice, beans and salad (all delicious). They also bring a warmer with corn or flour tortillas. But the main event... a volcanic-like cast iron cauldron (a molcajete) teeming with bubbling green sauce with various kinds of grilled meats and seafood hanging around the outside. The smell alone will bring you halfway to heaven, but ZOMG, taste explosion! SO GOOD. It comes with two breaded fish filets, two pieces of grilled steak, two of chicken and four big shrimp. Plus, there are little chunks of octopus in the sauce itself. If I had to choose a favorite, it would be the fish (or the seafood in general), but every bite of everything was honestly amazing. It may be the best sauce I've ever eaten. The service was superb both visits---super friendly, fast and helpful. The server was the one who recommended the molcajete in the first place, actually. The prices are almost unbelievable ($22 for a VOLCANO OF FOOD??). The restaurant itself is really clean and full ceramic tiles and colorful artwork. Some reviewers have commented about the dodgy location. The neighborhood seemed fine to me, though I don't live in Phoenix so I could be mistaken. It's mostly residential, but well-worth making a special trip (like, every single day) for this food!Note: If you're planning on ordering the ceviche as an appetizer, just be aware that you might not get your house ceviche tostadas. We didn't get ours the second visit because my boyfriend insisted on getting a full order of ceviche. He was hoping they would bring both (because he's insane and would eat an ocean full of ceviche if left on his own), but they didn't.On a recent vacation to Mexico, my mom asked Jared and I where the best Mexican food in Phoenix was... This place immediately came to mind for us both!When you walk into the door of Mariscos Playa Hermosa, you feel like you very well may be in Mexico.  It feels extremely authentic, with a festive atmosphere, a staff that doesn't speak too much English, and food that is delicioso!  It's nothing like the Americanized Mexican / Latin places  you've been to before. Don't load up on the chips and salsa as the portions are big and you'll want to save room for what is to come.  Their house iced tea is very good if you want something other than a cold cerveza.As Annie D said in her review, I highly recommend going with the Molcajete Caliente with verde sauce. You can't go wrong with that!  I ordered something else and ate off of Jared's Molcajete Caliente along with my own.  That sauce is incredible!Note that this place closes early during the week.  We met some friends there at 7pm and at 8:20 we were the last ones in there and we could tell the staff was ready to go home.  I can't wait to return to this local gem of a restauran for another memorable meal very soon.What a fantastic meal I had.  I've been desiring amazing Mexican restaurants in Arizona.  Since I moved here, I've been to several places that were underwhelming, at best, and generally just not good to me.  So, I'd given up on Mexican Food in AZ and I just didn't eat any.  Well, a conversation in Yelp Talk about Mexican Food inspired me to check out some different places and this one turned up in my searches on Yelp and other websites.I'm happy to say that I was so thrilled and enjoyed my meal very much at Mariscos Playa Hermosa.  Again, another hole-in-the-wall, but still quite the find.  Mariscos is located in a pretty seedy part of town, so don't get nervous going there.  They close early, so you'd better arrive early.  You will find that there is a full bar inside this colorfully decorated resto.  Don't eat at the bar.  That things not suitable for anything except decoration as the bar itself doesn't extend out far enough to make it comfortable to sit there.  (this is a tip from a person who opted to sit at the bar)I tasted a few items off the menu.  The shrimp in diablo sauce was my favorite.  I ordered extra diablo sauce on the side.   The sauce has a smokey taste with the heat of the peppers.  Perfect for my heat seeking taste buds.  They prepare the sauce "fresh to order".So there is a charge for $3 for the extra sauce on the side to go.  I used that sauce to make more shrimp diablo at home later that week.  I also enjoyed the camarones culichi... shrimp in green sauce.  Culichi is a tomatillio sauce made with some dairy product and cilantro and of course the poblano or tomatillio peppers.  The sauce is simply to die for.  I left there satisfied and happy!  I will return and take a friend for the Molcajete Caliente with verde sauce.  Can't wait.  I'm sure it will please.They have a check-in offer too, so be sure to check-in.Oh, that parking lot is TINY.  Be aware of that when you go.Mariscos Playa Hermosa was picked for May's International Supper Club UYE and we had a big turnout expected 14 but had around 26 to 30 and I have to say management & servers didn't blink an eye when I kept asking for another chair please.  Excellent customer service!  The parking lot is very very small, maybe can park 8 to 12 cars, but there is plenty of parking on the street, so that what I did, once inside the place is very colorful and inviting.I ordered the 3 carne asada tacos with beans and rice. They were great street tacos perfect for what I was craving. The beans and rice were ok, over all it was a good dish and with tax included came in under 10 bucks! That's a great deal for dinner!  After everyone was done eating they brought us out 5 different types of cakes/dessert to try, chocolate cake, tres leches cake, coconut cake, cheese cake & flan. I'm a chocolate lovin fool and the chocolate cake was perfect, it was sweet, rich and full of chocolaty goodness, but my favorite I have to say was the Tres Leches Cake, that stuff was amazing! Also the coconut cake was great too! I defiantly will be coming back to try a few other of their dishes for sure!
Tom's Diner=I have to say I really loved this place.  I love the mesh of old and new.  I love a greasy spoon.  Most of all, I love the fact that I can visit here any time of the day.I have heard of Tom's for a very long time.  I remember there being a Tom's in the South Side and visiting it many times, but this spot is so different.  There's a different vibe here, more laid back, less bustle.  Walking in here makes you feel as if you are entering a tiny road stop diner, you kind of forget that you are still within the Pittsburgh region, especially if you stop here in the wee hours of the morning.I grabbed a booth to myself and within a minute the waitress was there to hand me a menu and ask me what I wanted to drink.  Looking over the menu took me some time seeing how this was my first visit here.  I ended up ordering a BLT with a side of loaded fries.  While waiting for my food to arrive I looked around the place and took it all in.  The colors, decor, and furniture definitely give you that diner vibe.  When I think of a diner I think of the shiny chrome, the bright white and red checkered pattern and bar stools at a counter.  All of that is here!My food finally arrived and I started to dive into it.  The first thing that popped into my head was, "why did I order a side of fries?"  The BLT comes with a decent side portion of fries to begin with, I really didn't need more fries.  The BLT itself was perfect.  The bacon was greasy, yet crisp, the lettuce was refreshing and the tomato was just the right thickness.  Add a little mayo to the toasted bread and we are in business.  It was so good I wish I had just ordered two BLTs.  The loaded fries were pretty good as well.  Topped with cheese sauce and bacon (man, I just couldn't get enough of that bacon).The waitress on duty was super polite and very attentive.  Even though it was very early in the morning, she did not miss a beat or sit around.  The only gripe I have about this place is the prices.  Some of them need to be readjusted, but other than that, it's a stellar place to get a meal.**something to note: they do serve alcohol here.Tom's Diner is what you expect of diner food, cheap and filling.  The help isn't crazy fast but pleasant enough, and the kitchen is open.  They also have some unique selections, which makes them good in my book!The day I came in, I just wanted an omelette.  I think it was $7 or so, and it came with toast and potatoes!  The omelette was packed full of peppers, meat, cheese, and tomatoes.  There were plenty of toast options as well.  I wouldn't go out of my way to come here, but it is delicious all the same.There is a very small free parking lot behind the building for customers.
Long Wong's Restaurant=I am happy to report that after some quality hitches that I mentioned in my last review, Long Wong's is back to good!!  I've been in several times since my last review and each time the pizza and Pepsi were perfect and the wings were amazeballs.  Seems they took note of the issues and corrected them, good on them!If you haven't had Long Wongs wings then you really should try them.  In my humble opinion they beat all the other wing places, hands down.
Coach & Willies=So I went to a late lunch with the Moms this weekend. (One plopped me out and the other is her BFF that's been around long before I was doing boom-boom and creating crayon masterpieces on the wall.) They wanted salads somewhere downtown. And all the places I've never been to but have been wanting to go to for ages were either closed or greens free-- LoLo's (collard don't count), Palatte, Cheuvront, Cibo, My Florist, and so on.So Moms decided that Coach and Willie's was the perfect luncheon destination.(Cuz they thought the salads online looked purdy tasty, and they were right. But I shouldn't have "judged a book by its cover," since even McDonald's looks pretty good in commercials.)So I swing by to pick up my sis and we dash to Coach and Willie's. I thought the name sounded like a bastard love filly to a Pony Express stud. Or maybe some purebred dog name, like Sir Charles McWigglesworth.Easy to find. Parking was plentiful. Patio was neato. Sunken bar seemed like a novelty. Horseshoe shaped booths were comfy and inviting. Atmosphere was upscaley for a sports bar. Company was vivacious. Waitress was engaging and attentive. Bacon wrapped prawns were succulent and satisfying. My Woodchuck cider was tasting crisp and peary. And I had a big ole smile on my face.It was salad time. Now if a salad costs ten dollars, I expect more than a tasteless expanse of iceburg lettuce. What head chef uses iceburg lettuce any more? With all the varieties of salad greens to chose from, I end up with the tasteless, tacky trailer trash of the field greens world? I'm not saying you gotta get all pretentious with a salad by using micro greens grown in an organic hot house, but for fuck sake, iceburg? Airplanes and cafeterias are the only places I've ever encountered iceburg not in fancy pants wedge salad form, which classes it up some and acknowledges the fact that iceburg is tasteless filler devoid of nutrients of any sort.Is Coach and Willie's food comparable to airplane fare? Ahem, yes. My salad was anyway. Everyone else seemed to enjoy theirs, despite the offensive iceburg. I just ate the equally tasteless southwestern chicken mass that came on top and picked around the lettuce filler. So while the lunch was fun and the bacon wrapped prawns were rockin', the salad sucked. And since I've only been here once, they get a less than stellar review. (And I'm stating that straight up so nobody gets all persnickety. I've only been once. For lunch. And a crap salad.)I'm sure it's a fun place for drinks before a game or for a quick lunch with coworkers, but I'm taking a stand against iceburg lettuce. It should be eliminated on principle alone. (Aside from its uses as filler; see Navajo tacos and garnish.)Anybody want to join my one woman campaign?Came here for dinner with Scott after a wonderful baseball game.  Its right around the corner from Chase Field, and neither of us had been here before.  We had an excellent time together at Coach and Willies, but I think we both left with a feeling of something to be desired by this place.  Here's my take on the place:I dont think this place is bad.  I just think its not the greatest.  Scott and I did enjoy our time here, BUT, I think we both found the same things annoying about it.First, I feel like theres a conflict of decorating.  I feel like theres two completely different themes going on here, and they both clash with one another.  Part of it seems like it wants to be a nicer resturant....the other part wants to be a sports bar.  Neither one compliments each other.  When you walk in, theres a great patio area for dining.  Loved it!  But, then when you walk in, and kind of walk around, it shows signs of trying to be a sports bar.  The bar itself is set really low.  Lower then the tables themselves.  Heavy marble looking bar tops, with chairs.  At one point Scott and I counted 15 (YES 15!) flat screen TVs!  I will say, there was one particular TV in our area that I noticed that had amazing reception.  It was probably one of the better flat screens I have seen!  To my benefit, I ordered the half nachos.  The server ended up bringing me out a full plate of nachos (bonus!) and I was happy!  Food here is so so.  I feel like this place is a place I would probably bring my parents to, but it really didnt blow me away.I went to @coachnwillies last night, as part of the @downtownphoenix spring fling pub crawl.Coach & Willies is the reason negative ratings should be possible on @yelp.I will never, ever return.When we arrived, we ordered a beer, and a soda.We also ordered nachos. They were piled high. This is a good thing.Removing the first couple chips resulted in a couple olives falling on to the bar. I wiped them into a pile, but figured I'd wait until I was done, to catch anything else, and clean it up.A few of us decided to have a shot, to celebrate a birthday-in-progress. I flagged one of the bartenders down.He approaches me and says "Are you gonna stop making a mess on my bar?"Me: "Excuse me?"BT: "You're making a mess"Me: "I would like to order a drink, not get hassled"BT: "I don't care about your drinks, I only care about your tips"Me: "Well you're not exactly working for one at the moment"BT: "Are you going to order or not?"I placed my order without any further comments, lest I inform him of my true feelings.He takes my credit card and asks if I'd like to keep it open. I tell him no, because I have left my card in the past.He returns with the receipt. On the "tip" line I write "NoFuckingWay!"I work in a service industry. You don't treat me like shit and still get a tip. Fuck you.A while later I go to order a beer. This same motherfucker tells me I'm cut off.Yes, I am cut off.I have had maybe three beers, and a shot, in 5 hours.I ask another bartender, and as he is about to pour me a beer, the first SOB hollers to him that I am cut off, then proceeds to show him my receipt.Because, apparently, you not giving a tip is justification for him being a cocksucker.I demand to see a manager, and one comes over. I tell him that the guy is cutting me off because I refused to tip him, and he tells me that the problem is that there is a $10 minimum on CC transactions.Curiously, that isn't stated anywhere. Further, this "manager" took my first beer order, when I arrived, and made no mention of the minimum when I bought just the one beer, nor did the other bartender mention that when I paid for the shots, which actually totaled $24.This "manager" was gracious enough to let me pay their establishment for service again. /sarcasmI will recommend to every single person I know to never patronize that establishment, and I will never return to a place with such puerile and petty employees.I booked my birthday party here, mostly because of it's close proximity to The Duce. I was in contact with someone who said she was the Manager, Daron Harvey. She was great and said she would extend happy hour for my party. However, upon arrival, the night of my party, the manager on duty had no idea my party was coming. When I told him that I had spoken to a manager about having my party there and he snidely remarked, "that's weird, I'm the manager." Wow, way to be nice about the amount of business I am about to bring your bar. To top it off, we got there at 9pm, which is what I told the Manager I was e-mailing, just to find out they normally close at 10pm on non-Suns game nights, unless they have 20+ people. So, now I feel awkward 'cause we're keeping these servers past the time that they probably thought they were going home. The only reason I am not giving them one star is that they were still able to accommodate my party and give us the specials. Except after 1.5 hours of being there, the server asks me if we're all on separate checks. I don't understand how you just assume these things and we had to wait a bit longer to get our tabs. Lastly, I get the rule to add gratuity for such a big party, but the gratuity added was 22%. Random. Such a terrible experience.
IHOP=What do you do Sunday morning when you do not want any eggs or serial for breakfast? Well, we go to IHOP! And so we did this Sunday. Its 8:30am, there are ton of free tables and we get seated right away. Ohh wait! Its our server's 1st day!! OMG Horror! But, hey, you know what - kid was great! He did all just right and did not screwed up once! Kudos to you David! So, anyhow. Pancakes were good. Coffee was warm and OJ was fresh. There were no hairs in my plate nor weird stains on my spoon. What else can anyone expect from IHOP? 4 stars! If you wanna huge portion of pancakes go to IHOP, they got that!"I like"
Arrivederci=I am really quite surprised at the high reviews for this establishment. They truly don't deserve it! I purchased a coupon for this restaurant through my work (after checking the Yelp reviews, of course) so we were excited to give them a try but were sorely let down.When we arrived the first thing I noticed was the place was empty at 6pm. Well that's not a good sign! We waited for one of the employees to acknowledge us between their laughter and chatter between each other. Once being taken to our table we looked at the menu and couldn't believe the prices; they were extremely high. I told my boyfriend, its a good thing we have a coupon, this better be some dang good Italian food! Due to the high prices, we decided to share an appetizer and an entree, surely it would be plenty, it's an Italian restaurant! It took about 25 minutes for our appetizer of meatballs to arrive and when it did my boyfriend and I just looked at each other. There were about 6 tiny meatballs swimming in some marinara. I was expecting huge meatballs like what you get at Oregano's...nope, not even close! So we ate, and unfortunately the dish was nothing special. They tasted like they were from a frozen bag. As we were waiting for our entree I had been needing more water but regardless of the empty restaurant no one was checking on us. We waited for our entree another 20 minutes after that. Why was it taking so long? We were the only ones in the dining room. We finally received our entree. What the hell! It was just about the same size as our appetizer!!! There were three small rolls of pasta. Seriously? Did someone eat the other 3/4 of it back in the kitchen? We ate those in about literally a minute and then tried to scarf down some bread to help fill our stomachs. And the worst part, it wasn't that good. At this point I finally was given more water. Needless to say we would never come back here. Why pay such ridiculous prices for tiny portions of pretentious food with a side of crappy service? No thanks, I'll head over to Oregano's or RigaTonys!
Scott's Generations Restaurant & Delicatessen=4.5 stars... Minus a 1/2 star for the fact that I only experienced take-out and the fact that the kreplach in my soup didn't taste right.  Other than that, this is my new favorite place to get matzo ball soup.  The broth tasted just as good if not better than any I've had before.  The combination of vegetables, dill, seasoning, and fresh chicken soothed my sore throat instantly and warmed me up too!The menu is HUGE and the cases full of knishes, bagels, rugalach, muffins, smoked fish and more were impressive for the valley.  I noted that they have a section on the menu called "On The Liter Side" for those that are calorie or carb conscious.  I also noticed that they'll make egg white omelettes upon request (and for an additional $1).I'll have to return to Scott's Generations when I'm feeling better and my appetite is back to normal.  Hopefully that will be soon thanks to the soup I enjoyed today!Christmas really isn't my holiday...it's more for the Beautiful Carin, and I try my very best to play along and do what I should to make the holiday "joyful"...not my strong suit:)This Christmas is no different than 30 or 40 others that preceded it...it's the end of the year and that always bring its own peculiar brand of "troubles".Today, I had to visit with one of my attorney's (I know, pathetic)...some trouble with some partners in a business relationship and I am trying to figure out what the best course of action is...this attorney is my Doberman...he will chase people to the bowels of hell and bring them back screaming to be returned to Satan's loving grasp...if the compensation is right:)I don't Yelp him, because frankly, he scares me...a little bit:)I was bemoaning the holiday season to him during our session today (believe it or not our "chit chat" is quite brief at $425 per hour), and his legal advice was that I "sack up" and get over it:)To reinforce that, he took me to lunch (I must look like I'm going to be a gold mine to him!) at Scott's Generations:)That did indeed put a smile on my face and prepared me adequately for my next meeting this afternoon.I love deli...I get to NYC 2-3 times a year, and consequently I don't think very much of the deli's here in town...overpriced, under-sized...less than we should expect:(Even Goldman's, who's been good for several years, has fallen sharply over the past year.Scott's could change my perception of the deli landscape in PHX.I had a hot corned beef on rye that was as tasty as anything I've found in Phoenix...and it was huge...a restricted flight softball of hot, moist corned beef, between two thick slices of rye (from Karshes, next door, with plenty of caraway seeds:)Four salt brine pickle spears, and cole slaw, accompanied this behemoth:)I couldn't leave well enough alone and ordered a side of crinkle cut fries to "make the season bright":)$11.00 US money for the whole deal (no extra charge for "extra lean":)Everything was well made, tasty and nicely presented by the sweet ladies that serve the all the customers...I mean 20-25% tip service by these sweethearts:)I waddled out, with my mood adjusted back to "non-grinchy" (I'm sure this lunch will appear on the bill from my attorney, at some point...I just choose not to think about it right now:)I didn't even have room for a Black and White cookie from Karshes, after lunch...that's packing in the corned beef!While Scott's Generations is not, strictly (or even un-strictly) speaking "kosher", it is definitely in  the traditional "New York Style":)No, I would not claim it's as good as anything in Manhattan...but I gotta tell you, it's as good as a lot of neighborhood deli's in Manhattan...and easily the best of breed for PHX.How did I not know this existed?  It's within walking distance from home!Went with Chrissy P for a New Year's Day brunch.  It's so freaking hard to find a good NY-style deli up in here!Got there before her, so I grabbed a take-out menu.  Holy lox, Batman (I usually say "Holy frijoles, but it's a Jewish deli, get it??) the menu is HUGE!They have a full breakfast menu with omelets, Jewish staples like lox, blintzes and matzo brie.  There are huevos rancheros, skillet dishes to round out the breakfasts.Many different smoked fish dishes, too.  I had the egg salad sandwich on wheat bread.  *Real* wheat bread.  Though I think the egg salad was missing something, it was still delicious.  Also got a side of fries.  They were homemade crinkle-cut, with the skins still on them!  I love fries with the skin still there.  Service was ultra-friendly and we never had to ask for a refill on our drinks.I will definitely be back.  It will take forever to get through the menu, even for a pescatarian like me.I get into these wild food moods where Ill wake up and have a craving for something, its usually pretty specific, this particular morning it was corned beef. Sounds crazy but once I get it in my head I wont be satisfied until I give into my cravings. I wasn't hungry though for just any corned beef, it had to be Boar's Head brand, aside from a few grocery stores the only place you can get Boar's Head is a good delicatessen. I knew just where to go, Scott's!Situated between an Ace Hardware and a Basha's, this seems hardly the spot for a tasty sandwich. Let me tell you, they serve up massive tasty sandwiches with thick piled meat on your choice of bread and they have choices. Feeling helpless and at complete mercy to my urges I ordered Scott's Perfect Reuben-Reuben ($11.50). So tall you cant get your mouth around it, its stuffed with corned beef, swiss cheese and sauerkraut then grilled to a crispy buttery goodness.When the server set my sandwich in front of me my eyes widened, it was a thing of beauty and desire. As I managed my sandwich for the first bite, I felt the wafts of hot corned beef beckoning, eat me, eat me. Enjoying bite after satisfying bite, my morning craving was quickly becoming fulfilled like an ancient prophecy. Ordering a side of Russian dressing to dunk my fries into may sound slightly odd but after one dip I think you'll agree, its perfectly natural.For the health conscious who are rolling their eyes at my delicious choices, Scott's does offer lighter fare such as salads, soup and half sandwiches. However, I for one don't go to Scott's to eat light, I go to Scott's eat well.Scott's Generations is hands down the best east coast-style deli in the valley, particularly for breakfast. It's just as cheap as Denny's down the street and about ten times more satisfying and wholesome. Their baked goods and bagels are crisp, chewy perfection. No perpetrating steam oven biscuit bagels here like Breuggers or Einsteins.  And there's plenty of cream cheese options to schmear to your heart's content. I'm usually a pretty flexible diner, rotating through a menu to try new things, but here I get one thing and one thing only every time. Brandi's Breakfast Special for only four bucks: two eggs over easy, home fries and a garlic bagel with chive cream cheese.I guarantee that meal will sink like a satisfying rock to the bottom of your stomach and keep you full for hours. With coffee and tip the whole thing will set you back about eight bucks.Enjoy the surly granny wait staff that'll call you doll or sugar, and treat yourself to a black and white cookie on the way out. Trust me.I think this can give the Jewish delis of NYC a run for their money. The place itself is clean and spacious, and the comfortable booths were just right for the mini-UYE with Rand H., Mike C., and Robyn N. I ordered a half pastrami sandwich and a bowl of kreplach soup; these came with sides of coleslaw and pickle spears. A plate of bagel chips was also served with the soup. The pastrami sandwich was superb and overstuffed like it should be; really tasty - I thought I should have ordered a whole sandwich instead of a half. The kreplach was good; tasty and hearty, and a bowl could have been a meal. I really have to come back here to try other stuff, such as belly lox ... but return visits won't be too frequent for me, only because the food is quite pricey. The half sandwich, bowl of soup, and coffee cost close to 15 bucks.A Jewish girl walks into a (oh, wait, I am writing a restaurant review and not a J.A.P. joke)....When Scott's first opened many years ago, it was really good and had a lot more competition than it does now. In those days, there was Katz Deli, several Miracle Mile locations, Chompie's and a few other ill fated places (anyone remember Hollywood Deli?). I currently live in one of the best food meccas of the West Coast and can't get really good Jewish deli (Saul's is not great folks, and no, I have not tried Miller's yet). When Mom and Grandma picked me up from the airport, I had suggested we stop at Scott's to give them a try on the way to Sun City. None of us had been there in several years and I was really excited at a prospect for a delicious hot pastrami sandwich on rye. We got there, walked in and I noticed that the place itself looked a bit run down and dare I say, a little dirty? The owners are the same but the guy behind the counter who used to be friendly and Hamish just sat there like a schlub. We were directed to a table, and I immediately noticed how large their menu was. I ordered my sandwich sadly assuming that my regular hot pastrami would be (a) HOT and (b) on Karsh's rye since Karsh's is right next door. Neither was the case when my sandwich arrived and the pastrami was not delicious and I asked the waitress if I was mistakenly given the "lean" type of pastrami and she said I was not. Mom had a tongue sandwich and thought it was "okay" but she is not as picky (bitchy) as I am and Grandma had blintzes which did not look homemade but that of the frozen variety (I hope I am wrong here). Service was fair. Not warm and not quite the NY attitude that passes in these types of establishments.After our experience I will no longer suggest Scott's and will have them drive directly to Chompie's.A prompt, attentive service, and good Jewish deli will have me returning soon.I discovered this place when I went to get something at Ace Hardware.I noticed that they served breakfast all day, so I went inside the restaurant.I was seated right away and within minutes, I was given a glass of water.My server was friendly and accommodating.I was in a hurry, and without carefully looking at the menu, I decided to order the vegetarian skillet.It was okay, but I wish I had ordered something else.I do not like potatoes and onions in my omelet skillet.The restaurant is welcoming, and the walls are full of wedding and family pictures. It looks like it's a family owned and operated business. That's very nice and special.I will go back and try something else, but next time I will read the menu.Omg. MOLD, mold everywhere!!!! I bought two potato filled pastry's we get 3/4 through eating them and my boyfriend goes "Is that mold" we then pick the pastry shell apart and the entire thing is filled with thick black mold. This was hours after they were purchased! In about an hour we were both feeling sick, I threw up which was terrible. I'm posting a picture of the nasty moldy food we got. I'm shocked. I eat out everyday and have NEVER EVER had an experience like this. I ordered Borsch off the menu as well, and they were out so he just opened a can they had on the shelf and added tap water (for $8.95) I have to say one word...HORRIFIED!Pastrami, pastrami, pastrami, pastrami, pastrami, pastrami." on rye...that's the way I judge a dood Deli, by their Pastrami Sandwhich. Well this isn't up there with Chompies (portin wise) but it sure was close. The pastrami sandwich was surprisingly good. I prefer thick, hand-carved pastrami, "The pastrami was a perfect mix of lean and fatty portions and  and freshly carved. Definitely better than your ordinary pastrami. The pastrami here is to die for. Never in my life I imagined that pastrami, or any kind of meat for that matter, can be so succulent and juicy. It literally melts in your mouth. I got their Pastrami Sandwhich, my wife got their reuben. To go we got 6 bagels, lox spread, chopped liver, herring in sour cream sauce and some pickels.  What's good here, the answer is everything As for the desserts ... The massive slabs of Cheeese Cake was moist and ridiculously good (and ridiculously big)FOOD:  Unbelievably lean and tasty. I thoroughly enjoyed every bite of my sandwich. oh and their pickles..... don't even get me STARTED they were  exactly how grandma used to make them and the pickles just topped it off. PRICE: Although the prices are a bit high you will definitely have leftovers for lunch the next day. CONCLUSION:  The portions sizes are very generous,  especially for the price! I highly recommend giving this place a try!
Pink Pepper Thai Cuisine=I had the boofay yesterday with Ryan C. It was good. I liked being able to try it all and figure out what I do not like. There was nothing that was really bad, and nothing that was really great. It was all good. The coconut chicken soup thing was a little odd, but the chicken in it was really good quality and tasted good while added to other types of sauce. OH YEAH... They painted and re decorated. It looks really good in there.After a few parties left and we were the only ones in the place, we were just like the family from A Christmas Story christmas afternoon, although no one sang us a rousing chorus of "Deck The Harrs" like they got in the movie! We got several dishes to share family style.  Menu items more than hold up the 5 stars I gave the lunch boofay. Special thanks to the chef who rustled up khai yat sai, a thai omelet stuffed with minced chicken and veggies that wasn't on the menu, but a member of our party ordered in near-fluent thai, surprising both me and our server.Spicy pasta with chicken, Red curry chicken, blushing Buddha (veggies in brown sauce), chicken fried rice, spring rolls, Steak & Chicken with spicy thai lemon garlic sauce, and the khai yat sai were all superb.  Thai custard and fresh Mango sticky rice just sent this meal over the top, but for the portions the price was not over the top.
Star of India=I've lived here for three years and this was my first visit to Star of India. Not sure what took so long, other than I had no idea it was here ... buried in the back corner of the strip mall in Ahwatukee that houses the Trader Joe's I frequent. (That's where I procure my cornbread and my tea tree lavender liquid dish soap, among other staples.)Anyhow, I give Star of India 3.5 stars. The food was great and the digs were what you might expect them to be for an Indian restaurant buried in the back corner of a strip mall in Ahwatukee: simple but clean. We didn't come here looking for a scene, we came in search of fine ethnic eats, so the modest decorum was cool by us. And the eats were indeed fine and ethnic.The staff was friendly. I do have some advice for our server, however: you have a nice smile and were seemingly helpful in making suggestions from the menu, but try being a little more reassuring once I settle on something. I have enough uncertainty in my life. Example:Server: "How spicy do you like your food, on a scale of one to ten?"Me: (thinking, 'Gee, this is nice. I'm used to the one-to-five scale offered me by most Thai restaurants. There must be a favorable exchange rate right now, what with the economy and all.') "I like my food mild to medium, so let's say five."Server: "Are you sure?"Me: "Ummm ... I think so. Is that considered mild to medium?"Server: "Is this your first time eating here?"Me: "Yes."Server: "You may want to go easy, then."Me: "So ... three?"Server: "Really?"Me: (thinking, 'Don't do this to me. I have enough uncertainty in my life') "I don't know. Again, it's my first time eating here, so I don't have a barometer by which to measure your one to ten scale. What do you suggest?"Server: "Five should be good for you."Me: (perplexed) "That's what I was originally thinking."Server: "Do four then."Me: (again thinking, 'Don't do this to me. I have enough uncertainty in my life') "Let's go with that."Server: "Positive?"Me: (really unsure now) "YES!"The Aloo Parantha was great to start with. It's like naan, only whole wheat and stuffed with potatoes and green peas. Tasty. My Chicken Tikka Masala was very good, although I will do five next time. Alexis S. had Vegetable Korma and they were very accommodating so as to prepare it without nuts. (Something she has grown increasingly intolerant to, especially recently. Sigh. Lucky me.) I snuck a taste when she bent down to pick up her napkin. It was excellent. The Korma, I mean.Uncertainty in my life aside, one thing I'm fairly certainly certain of is that I'm pretty sure we'll be going back to Star of India. I must try the korma next time. And yes, I'm sure! (I think.)I feel really bad about not bestowing five whole stars upon this place in my previous review. In hindsight, the only explanation I have is that I was "holding back" because it was my first visit to ANY Indian restaurant in the valley since moving here and I didn't want to just go carelessly throwing five stars around before experiencing other Indian restaurants. To help you understand what I mean ... It's as if you were an ice skating judge at the Winter Olympics. And the first skater out, say, from the Congo, absolutely blows you away. Like, you can't believe it! But the whole time she's skating  you're thinking 'The Congo? Do they even have skates? Have they ever even seen ice?' And she finishes her routine and it's flawless. But you haven't seen any of the other skaters yet. So you can't go ahead and give her a perfect score, especially without seeing the Russian chick first. But you're not allowed to wait and see the Russian chick before having to submit your score for the gal from the Congo.  They need your score right now! So you ding her for some arbitrary reason, like her skate laces weren't the same length as each other. Or something.And then you get a chance to watch the other skaters, Russian chick included, and they were all just "meh." And you wish you could go back and change your score for Ms. Congo, but you can't; the IOC won't allow that. And you have recurring nightmares about the medal ceremony, where she stands on the podium with her bronze medal, just below the South Korean girl (who trains in the US) and yes ... the Russian chick. But she displays great sportsmanship. She smiles as the Russian flag waves and "Gosudarstvenny Gimn Rossiyskoy Federatsii" (that obnoxious national anthem) plays over the loudspeaker. She is probably happy with her bronze medal. She might even be a hero in her home country. But you know it's just not right. She was done an injustice, and YOU were responsible for it!!Luckily this is Yelp, and not the Winter Olympics. Now that I have eaten at several other Indian restaurants in the valley, I have become a regular at Star of India and would like my previous three star review stricken from the record and replaced with five strong stars. In fact, I'm gathering signatures on a petition that Star of India be renamed Five Stars of India. They deserve their gold medal.
El Mesquite Restaurant=El Mesquite is an outstanding neighborhood spot where tradition meets plate- and the customers are the big winners. As others have mentioned, this is a neighborhood place, where everyone knows each other, and the servers work here forever.If you need corporate clutter, fake ambiance, licence plates on the wall, etc. this is not a place for you. If you like authentic food, warm service and spicy tasty salsa, then grab a table, and tell your taste buds to buckle up.I first went to El Mesquite years ago when I worked downtown. I fell head over heals for their unique chips and addictive spicy salsa. Warning, it is hot, but it's not hot just to be hot, like other places (cough cough, Los Dos...).Being that this is a Mexican restaurant, beloved by locals- you will hear Spanish, laughter, English, and sometimes a combo of  the three. I really do love El Mesquite, they put up with my crap Spanish, and you do not need to speak Spanish to be comfy at El Mesquite. As others have said, when you arrive, you seat yourself, drinks, chips & salsa will be right behind you. Food is great here, and the price point is very good for the value and amount of food you get. I highly recommend the carne asada burro. I know right now America's Taco shop is reigning supreme, but if El Mesquite was near America's, there would be an epic battle because El Mesquite easily beats their carne asada. No bull!$%@.Also amazing is their guacamole, unlike many places, El Mesquite doesn't put a bunch of filler ingredients to make the guac go farther. Jus tasty ingredients, and your mouth will be happy. I also want to recommend getting a quesadilla, they are really tasty and cooked to perfection.Enjoy your trip to El Mesquite, you will not be disappointed, and if you are like me, this place will be in your rotation for 'go to' places!
Kam's=After seeing Jenna, Sarah and Melissa all give Kam's one star, I realized they are the most intelligent people reviewing Kam's and I had to follow in their footsteps. They're right - Kam's blows. It deserves ZERO stars. You know how you can pin point freshman when they come to the UIUC? Bingo! They're toting around bright orange Illini Union Bookstore bags. Same goes to the people who wait in line at Kam's. The majority are freshman. Underage drinkers who can't hold their liquor. Screw that.Some drunk guy peed on my foot here. True story. I was only eighteen and not proud to be in the bar.You can find cheap drinks with "attractive" and coherent people almost anywhere else in Champaign Urbana. LOOK!Are you a sensible, intelligent human being?  Are you older than 19?  Does your clothing generally obscure your breasts/underwear/genitals from plain sight?  Are you averse to fist-pumping?  Does the pungent odor of beer-tinged vomit make you nauseous?  Well, then, welcome to KAMS - your personal hell.
Carmon's Restaurant=I came here for brunch on a Sunday with my bf, and we had a pretty good meal. I'd been hoping to check this place out for a while, as it's located just three blocks from my apartment and I'd read good things about it. The food is French, mostly crepes, and pretty tasty. We started with the pate appetizer, which came with cornichons, sweet onion relish, old-style mustard, and baguette: no complaints, it was very tasty. I then had the special French toast, which came with peaches: for some reason I expect fresh peaches, but they were canned. Still, it was pretty good. My bf got one of their loaded savory crepes, which had cheese, ham and a few other things, and I believe he liked it. We also had two glasses of French hard apple cider: delicious.So the food was pretty good (but I still want to give it a try for dinner), and the service was also very friendly. Not too much of an ambiance, but it's still a good place to go.I am pretentious and I love pretension.  Carmon's offers pretension and delicious taste all at once.  I came in for brunch this morning, and loved the atmosphere, the overdone fin-de-siecle details, and....the crepes.I had a delightful buckweat crepe filled with eggs and bacon that was far more classy than a savoury breakfasty thing had any right being.  I was also incredibly nervous as I was sitting with a Harvard professor and talking about Woodrow Wilson, or perhaps just from the very strong double espresso they whipped up here.  Speaking of coffee, if you get a chance, order a cup of regular filter coffee.  They'll pour you a refill from a ginormous metal coffee urn that looks like it was filched from Scheherezade's palace.  No, seriously, it does.  Or from Toulouse LaTrec (at least the John Leguizamo version).Well worth a trip for brunch.
Jordan's Mexican Food=Jordans has been closed for 3-4 years now. Much to my dissapointment because I always enjoyed going here for lunch and getting their tostadas.RIP Jordans.
Buca di Beppo Italian Restaurant=I hate to do this...I just hate to...but I have never experienced this before. I don't know if I can ever return to Buca. Firstly, I knew there was something wrong with the server when we arrived. She just seemed...off...or high. She was very awkward and kept flirting with my date. Not only that, but she completely ignored me as if I wasn't sitting right there. To make matters worse...much worse, our yummy carbonara had a hair in it. A nice long blonde hair. I was done. I pulled it out and showed my date, he looked at it and told me to just get rid of it. Ok, I did, and I stopped eating. He kept eating lol, until...I found another hair!!!!!!!! Yuck!!!! There is nothing worse than someone else's hair in your food. The night was ruined for me, and we both stopped eating, I never speak up when I am unhappy about something. I am just naturally a friendly, non-confrontational girl, but I felt like I had to say something! No one should have to eat food with hair in it, and have to pay $19 for it. Alas, my date didn't want to make things more awkward since  out server seemed to be on the verge of an emotional breakdown. So, I kept quiet against my better judgement. She later returned with the check, which was wrong, and claimed that she would have to pay the difference out of her pocket if she tried to change it. Confused! Then she asked us to do the survey and give her 5 stars. Ha! I just started laughing, I was sure this entire night was a joke. She literally said, as she knelt down to our table and clasped her hands as if in prayer (I couldn't make this up guys) I'm new here, could you please give me 5 stars, for the good of humanity, and for all those people without jobs in the world.) This was entertaining. Then, she proceeded to take my dates credit card and flirt with him some more! She touched his chest and asked if he had any brothers. Holy...cannoli... get me out of here! I was happy to leave, and planned to never return. That woman just creeped me out. Sorry Buca, a previous visit was much better than this one.Booked on Open Table, right after I got the confirming email I called the restaurant and asked if the kitchen table was available. I happen to enjoy sitting in the kitchen. So I was disappointed that my wife and my daughter weren't fans of the experience. But Buca was awesome - they swapped us right out into another table immediately without a wait. Woot!We chose the large tossed salad to start and then three big entrees to share. Yep, that was probably too much food. Huge platter of Eggplant Parmesan. Big tray of cheese manicotti. Ginormous vat of shrimp fettuccine Alfredo. All really delicious, all really big servings. We took a shedload of it home with us.As for the desserts, they are ALSO sized to share. The brownie sundae, by itself, is enough for five people. And we also had what we thought was going to be ONE canoli but was actually three of 'em. Oy, my tummy hurts.
Ephesus Mediterranean Kitchen=Came here on a Sunday, it was slow and we got our food in good time.Ordered two personal size pizzas, spicy fries, fried zucchini & onion rings. The pizzas were actually really good but the other sides weren't worth it. Tastes plain & over cooked. Ok so the reason why I'm giving this place 1 star is because I saw soooo many health code violations! * A RedBull can on the pizza dressing table.* The woman who charged me was working on a pizza and didn't even wash her hands after she charged me! She just went right back to working on making the pizza! * The same woman who charged me -NOT kidding ...her nails were long & yellow, mind you she wasn't wearing any gloves while putting that pizza together. YUCK!! * Same chick went out for a cigarette break (in the front of the place) and when she was coming back in she brought AND blew the smoke inside the restaurant. Price range in Yelp language is $$I definitely won't go back because if that's what I was able to witness in the front of the place, I don't want to imagine what's going on in the back!!! I don't think I'm being harsh. That was one too many violations in my opinion.I stopped into Ephesus tonight with CM and two good friends before attending the PSO's concert at the Three Rivers Arts Festival.  We were planning to get take out and have a picnic at the concert, but alas, rainy weather struck (surprise, surprise!), so we ended up having dinner here before heading over to Heinz Hall, where the concert had been relocated due to the weather.CM and I ordered a medium Moroccan spiced chicken and plum pizza to share ($14.99), and our friends each ordered pide, with one ordering the Ephesus, and the other ordering the soujcuk ($9.49 each).  Both CM and I enjoyed the complex medley of flavors and textures comprising the chicken/plum pizza, which was complemented by a cup of seemingly homemade ranch sauce served with the pizza.  The plums were dried, and weren't overwhelmingly sweet or fleshy, and lent the perfect hint of sweetness to the savoriness of the chicken and the spicy kick of the sauce.  The sliced nuts (almonds, I believe) were also a nice touch, and the size was more than enough for the two of us.  My only major criticism was that the myriad of toppings made the pizza a bit unwieldy to eat, and often fell off as we ate it.The pide were rather long and thin in profile, and were each topped by a pepper.  I didn't try the Ephesus version, which is topped with ground beef, due to my aversion for that meat.  I did try a slice of the sojcuk pide, however, which is topped with cheese and Turkish pepperoni.  While the pepperoni were different in flavor than traditional pepperoni, the overall effect was reminiscent of eating traditional pizza that just happens to be long and thin.  I didn't try the greens that came with the pide, but they seemed similar to those used to top the chicken/plum pizza, and our friends weren't fans of the sauce, which they found rather oily and flavorless.  However, I did try the tzatziki sauce served with their pide, which was thick and had a great cucumber-yogurt zip.One important thing to note is that Ephesus seems to have relocated since several of the previous reviews were written--they are now located at street level on 4th Ave., and the space is actually rather nicely decorated for a pizza parlor.  Having said that, judging from the amount of phone calls and runs of the delivery guy, the majority of their business still seems to consist of delivery.  Overall, we were pleased with our experience, and would return to try some of their other offerings.
De Marco's Italian Grill=This restaurant was one of the best surprises of my last trip out to Fort Mill.  I was visiting one of our properties and the staff recommended this place for lunch.  Since it was almost literally next door to the property, I figured I would give them a try.  I'm glad I did because the food was delicious and amazingly cheap.I had the lasagna and it was so large I couldn't even finish it and ended up having to put some of it in the refrigerator for later.  Guess how much it cost?  Remember - this is homemade lasgna that tasted like it was freshly made that morning.  Ready to guess how much I paid?  $5.75!!  Yes, $5.75!!  In Atlanta the same thing would have been at least $9.00 if not more.This is a top choice for delicious food at a good price.  Honestly, you can't beat it.
Elie's Deli=Yowza....  Food so good you'll slap yer Momma!I've driven by this place a gazillion times, and I've been wanting to try it.  I hadn't quite sated my need for Mediterranean food, so I decided to get some take-home.  I'm *trying* to be sort of careful about what I eat and making sure I get more veggies, blah blah blah.  So I got the mixed meat salad -- because I still needed some gyro meat.  All I can say is WOW.  The veggies were fresh and crunchy, the chicken was great -- marinated and really tender.  And, FINALLY, gyro meat that dreams are made of!  Perfectly seasoned, and just freakin good!  I chose the house dressing -- garlic, lemon, and olive oil -- and it was a great choice -- it was awesome.  This big ass salad comes with pita bread, but I'd get an extra, so you can sop up whatever dressing is left.  The service was lovely as well.  The sister of the owner was working this evening, and was so friendly.  I will definitely be coming back.  I can't wait to try more!!!!!!
Slice of Sicily=I enjoyed a wonderful pizza here last night.  My toppings included black olives, mushrooms and artichokes.  My boyfriend enjoyed the baked ziti. We have been driving past this place forever and always want to stop in. Last night when we were decided what to do for dinner I said, let's have pizza and let's look on Yelp for a recommendation.  We decided that Slice of Sicily would be our choice based on closeness to our apartment and the good reviews it received.    We drive up and get a spot right in front!  Hooray for good luck!  There were only two people eating inside so we picked out a table and took a seat.  The tables were all red and white checkered and the walls full of Italian maps and posters.  The west wall was an interesting mural of an Italian landscape with bare trees and sunflowers.  The decor reminded me of how much I missed Italy. We took a look at the menu, ordered and looked on the huge map of Italy next to us.  I asked Gary if he knew where I was born... he knew it was up north.  So I showed him, I also showed him the placed I lived in Italy and the place we are going to retire too.  He always laughs when I say that.  He doesn't know how serious I am!Our waitress was nice and between her and the owner we got everything we needed.  The owner's family is from Sicily, but her mother was born in the states.  Our food was fantastic.  I no longer need to drive all the way to NYPD for New York Style Pizza, I can drive up the street to Slice of Sicily.There was a nice steady stream of people in and out of the restaurant.  They do many to go orders.  They had many regulars.  We will definitely be regulars. I would have given this place 5 stars but when we ordered two canolli's they went back to grab them and came out empty  handed.  They unfortunately were out of canolli batter.  We were a little disappointed but said we'd be back for more pizza and canolli another time.I definitely recommend this restaurant if you like family owned pizza places and great New York style pizza. I hope this review is beyond satisfactory to those who take this site way way way too seriously.  I tried to write a few more paragraphs, but there wasn't anything left for me to cover.
Comedor Guadalajara=I visited Comedor Guadalajara for the first time last night. This is a gigantic restaurant located in South Phoenix. The Good: The menu is extensive. The salsa they bring with your chips is hot and delicious. Ordered the "three meat plate" (for two) and was bombarded by a metal skillet (with it's own built in burner) heaped with a mountain of steak, chicken, pork, jalapenos, and onions. It was a meal for 4! The flavors were exquisite.The Bad: The decor is bland, and the lights are brighter than the sun.The Ugly: Nothing at all was ugly about the place. The staff and patrons were all very friendly. The bathroom was clean. The place felt safe outside even after dark (they have a security guard posted at the door).There's no better way to undo a 3 mile morning walk than to end up stuffing your face at the Comedor.  This place is muy grande and could be the perfect spot for a very very large dinner party. The parking lot is huge and is tended by courteous security guards who welcome you in at the door. The menu is extensive and offers some unusual items such as Chicharrone (pork rind) and Nopales (cactus) dishes along with an interesting   Caldo de Mariscos (Seafood Soup). Great if you're looking for some food adventure! Que suave~I started my post walk lunch with a cold Pacifico that came with a large frosty mug. Man that beer went down good!  The chips were delivered warm with a side of chili tepin style salsa.  For starters, we ordered the Frijoles con Chorizo dip. I'm not huge fan of chorizo but really enjoyed this dip. The chorizo was mild (not greasy at all) and was served with oven toasted chips topped with melted cheese. We shared a plate of the Chili Verde con Papas which is a rich green chili sauce with chunks of beef, potatoes, and onions served with refried pinto beans and tortilla. For our other dish, we had the Chilaquiles Y Huevos. This dish was the main reason we went to Comedor and it didn't disappoint.  This was layered corn tortillas soaking in a red chili sauce and topped with two over medium eggs and served with a side of frijoles and warm tortilla. The only problem I ran into was eating way more then I should have. It must be a good sign if you waddle out of the place whining and holding your gut.I'll be heading back very soon to try the Nopalito dish and the Pescado Entero Tilapia; Pan Freed "whole" Tilapia. Can't wait!I have been here once. Thank you Genny C. I had the chilaquiles y huevos ($7.95: cut up corn tortillas smothered in red chile and cheese and topped with eggs - i suggest over medium). A huge fan of huevos rancheros, I had never had chilaquiles (or heard of them) before this visit.  They took hold of me! I dream of them now. I wake longing for them. I wish they were served past 10:30. As for the restaurant: the place is ginormous! Don't let the security guards in the parking lot put you off. Instead, let them get the door for you and take comfort in a delicious meal served by friendly staff who will greet you in Spanish but just as easily will answer you in English.i use to go by here every day of the week and never knew this place was open. the parking lot always empty. in fact i've had several people i trust tell me how great this place was..and i never realized..THIS was the place they were talking about. gasp. so i came her with my BFF's family for fathers day. it was pretty damn good. after a very long wait and eventual long walk to the rear dining room we got seated. chips pretty tasty, sales pretty spicy. food was delish..i got carnitas and they were big porky chunks of awesomeness. they gave me large tortillas..which was ok cause i just tore off pieces to pick up meat. my one complaint...it reminded me of my highschool cafeteria. Jaguar Pride What!! anyways..the vast openess and still confined spacing of the restaurant. if there was a fire breakout..i don't think anyone would make it out alive tho. :(carnitas were bombdigity yaheard!! get on it. price is affordable, and the menu distinctly not, run of the mill "mexican food"It was the 2nd meet up for The International Supper Club and this time Comedor Guadalajara was the place to be!From the outside, you are not quite sure of what are you are getting into, you walk up to the place and you see a huge concrete pad that looks like it's used for outside parties maybe?  You go through the doors and then are shown your table and your mind is thinking how is it possibly this is the same building you were looking at on the outside.  It's huge, and opened, and I didn't even see the entire place. It's well lit and the colorful! A very nice surprise!We were a party of 8 and our server was Maria, and she was amazing, she made sure we had everything we needed and more. When you 1st walked in the podium for the hostess says NO SPLIT CHECKS, so our party didn't even ask, we would have figured it out, but when it came time for the check, Maria had already split them up for us.  Love great service!The chips are fresh, the salsa, well for me it's perfect! I could have stood it a tab bit hotter, but it had the perfect bit of heat for me, but for a fellow dinner, it was too hot for him.Ordered a cheese crisp and some guacamole for appetizers and the cheese crisp was just that, a cheese crisp nothing too exciting to write about, but the guacamole, omg it was soo fresh tasting, I loved that stuff!! I think I might have even licked it off my fingers, I'm sure I could have eaten the entire bowl myself  (or did I).One of the Wednesday night specials was a poblano pepper stuffed with cheese and topped with green chili sauce with grilled chicken, and it came with beans & rice. OMG AMAZING!!!!!!!!!! I didn't even see it on the menu but damn I want it again! The pepper was fresh, the green sauce was delish, and the grilled chicken just tied this dish together! The beans and rice were perfectly cooked. AMAZING!!!!My meal filled me up pretty well, but I did order a churro, and it was the perfect way to end a great meal. Love churros!!! Warm pastry stick covered in cinnamon and sugar. Oh yea I went home a happy girl for sure!We had been looking for a solid Mexican place that is genuine, but in the good way.. not that other way. This place delivered. When someone asks me if I know a good Mexican restaurant, this will be my recommendation. It has the standard quirks that Mexican restaurants usually comes with. What quirks you may ask? You know.. the quirks. Very roomy too, check out other customers pictures. They start you off with a tasty soup, that I only can imagine that is free. The prices can look like they are a bit on the high end for a place  like this (relative, they are not expensive), but then again when you have this rate of return customers, you can charge that little extra.. and you as a customer get it back in quality, and quantity. I didn't finish my full plate.The chicken chimi.A massive chimi. One! The size of 3 normal chimis. More than enough rice, more than enough beans covered with cheese. Yes, this seriously was not in my diet.. but I was hungry, and I got stuffed. I would definitely have this again. The waitresses is good and patient. No mistakes, and took our silly questions with a smile. No, I think I have found my go-to Mexican place for now. They deserve their reputation.. and they have been there forever, which means like 40 years or something.Comedor Guadalajara in S Central is housed in a great building.  Large restaurant - absolutely beautiful - high ceilings, with a comfortable waiting area, and spacious table arrangement.  Family oriented.  They definitely cater to the Mexi brethren.  The host guided us to the table for what seemed like the distance of an average Phoenix block and I was like, "Oh this is still part of the restaurant?!"  The menu is large enough for a nearsighted grandma complete with a few pictures for folk like me who are constantly asking:  what's that, how's it, who dat?  If you're short on cash that week or forgot your wallet you can easily fill up with the sopa appetizer (a vegetable pasta soup) they bring upon seating and the obligatory corn tortilla chips.  The chips were warm.  Mmmm.  And delicious with spicy salsa.  I also ordered some churros.  Made-to-order.  Hot hot hot and yum yum yum.  If I return to CG, it'll be with a different flock, and I would like to have a peck at one of the molcajetes or something out of the mariscos category because my own snobbish preference is for more upscale dishes.  Word to the wise:  if you want to eat here, you best be an early bird because they're not open all day.  And prepare to wait about 20 min for a table, even at the break of lunch time.  This place is more popular than a high school jock and cheerleader couple.Comedor Guadalajara was the place picked for May's breakfast club, let's just get the eh parts out of the way 1st, They do not take any reservations (so I was told) but they do have plenty of seating but you have to wait until at least ¾ of your party is there before being seating.  2nd, they do no split the checks and they said only a max of 5 cards per check, so if you are coming with a party, make sure to bring cash, and take in to account that tip & tax is per everyone in the party, not just what you order. The bill was sort of a cluster, but we got through it.I came for breakfast, but when I heard what my son was ordering dangit I wanted it too, plate envy right off the bat. I ordered the machaca chimichanga with verde sauce. It was shredded beef, eggs, jalapenos, onions & tomatoes, I figured even though it was on the regular menu and not breakfast, the fact that it had egg in it made it ok. The burrito was delish, the meat was tender and juicy the jalapenos fresh and vivid in color, the verde sauce was so good! Before I knew it the burrito was gone! It did come with a side of rice & beans as well.  Another great meal at Comedor Guadalajara, and fun time with the breakfast club!
Yunan Wok=Been ordering from these dudes for a long time and usually wait until my wife is on out of town and I'm not in the mood to cook. Ha!The inside of this restaurant is a little scary and pretty dark. I've never really seen anyone eating in here. They do have a little fish tank with some big fish swimming around in circles and looking for attention. I get hungry just watching them.Most of their menu is your typical American style Chinese and nothing that would be considered authentic or what they really eat overseas. It is hard to find the real stuff and when you do they end up closing.Always order the Volcano Beef and have them make it extra spicy. The House Lo Mein is also very good and my wife seems to enjoy that one the best. Usually upgrade to some Fried Rice to take things up to the next level.This place is probably best for a night of heavy drinking and getting it delivered to the house. The food is ok but the prices are higher than other places with a similar menu. The delivery times can also vary depending the crew that is working that night.More or less this place is a Meh experience with slight touches of A-OK. The best part is you will have some tasty leftovers the next day to work off any type of party residuals. BEER ME!2.5 STARS
The Great Impasta=We're new to Champaign-Urbana and decided to try The Great Impasta after reading that it serves fresh/homemade pasta. My husband and I went with our families who were helping us move in. When we arrived, we were promptly seated at our reserved table. I should have realized than an almost empty restaurant on a Saturday night is never a good thing. I picked up my bread plate to move it and saw a squashed tomato underneath.  We then proceeded to wait at least 20 minutes to even be served water or asked for our drink order. When we finally got around to order, we had to listen to a pretentious and inattentive server. When my  mother-in-law (not a foodie) asked for her tuna medium well, the server told her that it's only good if served rare and it was a crime to serve medium-well, which was very rude. I agree a tuna steak should be seared and gets dried out and flavorless past medium-rare- but- there are better ways to approach the situation. Perhaps suggest that the chef likes to prepare it medium rare, but we have a nice salmon that you may enjoy more. The menu indicated that the Fettuccine Alfredo sauce had egg in it (which is not authentic Alfredo) and I asked if the chef could leave out the egg because I was pregnant and unable to have eggs that were not fully cooked (Hollandaise and Bernaise  sauce, Caesar dressing, and homemade ice cream are also on the forbidden list for the same reason). A halfway decent chef should be able to do this with their eyes closed- especially since Alfredo is traditionally only butter and Parmegiano-Reggiano or Parm-Butter-Heavy Cream.  The waiter would not even go back and ask the chef about this- he simply refused (and this was for health purposes- not taste preference- I am visibly 7 months pregnant), again, rudely. We then inquired about the ravioli, which it turns out, is not made fresh, and the pasta with clam sauce- which is made with canned clams- not fresh ones. How was the food we actually ordered? Bad. I ordered a fettuccine with chicken and what was supposed to be a bacon/cream/white wine sauce. It was so bland, no amount of salt or grated cheese could salvage the dish. No hint of bacon or wine or any aromatics like garlic or shallot. The "fresh fettuccine", which should be thin and light, was so thick and dense- I would rather eat dried Barilla fettuccine or the refrigerated Buitoini stuff from the supermarket.  My husband ordered pasta with a red sauce that resembled Prego- it was so sweet and pasty. My mother ordered the salmon, which came rare. She prefers her salmon medium/medium-well and asked the server to please bring it back to the kitchen and cook further. He told  her "it's supposed to be that way." A good server would have said, I'm sorry, I will take care of this right away- and done it- NOT argued with the customer. You couldn't pay me to go back. I've had better meals at the Olive Garden- and that isn't saying much.
Salonika Gyros=I stopped by last night for dinner with CM after we'd spent the afternoon at Duquesne University, since I had a City Dining Card for Salonika, and it'd been awhile since CM and I had had Greek food. The first thing to note that surprised me a bit is that Salonika doesn't provide table service--orders and payment are accepted up front, and food is provided on trays that you take to a table in the dining area.  The staff bus the tables, which clearly needed doing at the time of my visit.Based on other Yelpers' recommendations, I ordered the rosemary half chicken with lemon potatoes ($7.39), and CM did the same.  While the flavor of this entree was decent, I found it extremely greasy, and I suspect the chicken wasn't of the best quality, since pieces of bone kept breaking off and ending up in my mouth.  As for the lemon potatoes, again, the flavor was on point, but the texture was off, such that they were mushy in some places and so hard as to prevent chewing in others. The sauce on the plate from the potatoes had a great flavor, which I used to dip the chicken and complimentary pita bread that came with the entrees into, but it was also quite greasy from the chicken.CM and I also decided to order dessert, with him ordering the baklava and me ordering the chocolate cake, which looked super-tempting in the case.  I'm happy to report that the cake didn't disappoint--it was substantial and moist with thick, fudgy icing and a pleasant, though unexpected, tinge of anise flavor.  I tried a piece of CM's baklava, and enjoyed it as well--it had a generous coating of honey, and plenty of chopped nuts.Overall, I found the food at Salonika to be inexpensive (at least, for entrees and the Cultural District) and flavorful, but to be lacking somewhat in execution.  I'd consider returning the next time I'm downtown and have a craving for Greek food, since I believe Salonika is one of the few gyro places downtown that stays open beyond lunch hours.  If I'm looking for a nicer sit-down dinner, however, I'll pass Salonika up for one of the many other restaurants in the vicinity. 3.5 stars.
Gorditas El Tio=They are very, very, VERY racist!! This is my 3rd time visiting this yummy Mexican place. The food is AMAZING! Sadly they are racist :( The first time I ate food from here my husband got it to go(my husband is white...blonde hair, green eyes), while I waited in the car. He ordered me nachos and got him self carne asada fries. The nachos were really yummy, but they didn't have a lot of toppings. I went back on my own about a week and a half ago and the food they gave me was AMAZING! It was 100 times better than what my husband got! I'm middle eastern, but can pass as Mexican. I assumed my food was better because there was a man working the register and cooking the food. I decided to go back a few days ago for lunch because the food was sooooooo good! Well, this time there were women behind the counter....they were super nice and friendly! I noticed some white people come in and her attitude completely changed, she was rude and almost seemed annoyed that they were there. Their food was ready before mine, the quality was the EXACT quality my husband got! My food was ready right after theirs, and mine was AMAZING wayyyy better than what they got!! I don't think they like white people....the whole menu is in Spanish! I can read and speak Spanish...so it's no problem for me. I think if they really wanted Americans in their restaurant.... they would translate the menu. I give it 3 stars because they are nice to me and the food is AWESOME! I take away the other two because they were not so nice to my husband :(I was in the area and decided to try out this Taco shop since I don't live nearby.  When I walked into the restaurant, I thought I would have an awesome meal...but it turned out to be mediocre.  Here's what I ordered:Beans/Rice/Cheese Burrito, $3.10Carne Asada Taco, $1.33The BRC Burrito was ok....the Beans didn't taste fresh.  The Carne Asada Taco was pretty good, but didn't have that "addictive flavor" to it.  I love Mexican Food and judge restaurants by asking this simple question..."Will I get the urge to drive a long distance (15+ min) to eat there?".....in this case, the answer was "no".Return Factor - 30%
Honey Bear's BBQ=Oh I don't know what the big deal is. OMG!...people scream at me...you HAVE to eat at Honey Bears. It is soooo good. So I go. Hmmm...WTF. I order a pork sandwich, side o slaw and side o potato salad. Sandwich came with all the s.o.s. which on one hand is good cuz otherwise the bun would fall apart like my Aunt Helen did when I told her I was a homo. But the meat suffers from not "marinating" in said sauce. Slaw was passable but the potato salad had that weird store bought, vinegary, mustardy, icky poo cocka flavor. Ya'll know what I mean! I guess I'll just have to wait til I hang with the inlaws in San Antonio cuz then we always go to Bill Miller BBQ and sistahs let me tell you Mr. Miller knows BBQ!Sure do love some Honey Bears!  Cheap tasty eats for us carnivores.  Luckily for me, this location is 5 minutes from my work making it one of my favorite lunch break spots.  I would give it an extra star if it had the cool ambience of the Van Buren location but alas, it feels like a 1980's fast food joint.As I left the Heard museum parking lot and headed north on Central, I thought I might stop at Fez and try their Feb. pasta special.  (What I really wanted to do was to head over to Rose and Crown to meet with new acquaintances, but I didn't want to worry about parking...)  On the way, I spotted HBB on the left, but I kept going north for Fez.  However, it seemed like I'd never get there, so I gave myself a stopping point- if I hadn't reached Fez by the next light, I was going to turn around and interrogate the poor soul that happens to greet me at Honey Bear's.  The poor soul's name was Rich, who informed me that HBB only has one sauce, and unfortunate for me, it contains *.  (I received the same response at the Glendale Chocolate Affaire, but I assumed the "one sauce only" was for convenience purposes.  See?  Never assume.)  He sold me on the fact that they marinate the meats in a spice and vinegar-based marinade.  Alright, I'll try a 1/2 pound (about $8 w/ tax) of pork (his fave) and beef (which the young man, who patiently waited behind me while I asked poor Rich so many questions, ordered after I stepped aside and considered my options).  No, wait, I'll have a full pound (about $15 w/ tax), and could you add chicken, too?  And bbq sauce on the side, please. While I waited for my take-out order, I asked Rich if I could sample the sweet potato pie, and to my surprise, he handed me a slice, told me to grab a spoon, and help myself!  It took only one teaspoonful of that slice for me to decide on purchasing a whole pie ($12) to go.  So how did the meats taste w/o the bbq sauce?  The chicken was very bland and pretty dry.  The beef was not much better, but at least it had some mouth-feel.  The pork was the clear winner, esp. since its marinade had the added benefit of red pepper flakes.  Would I go back for more meat?  Unless HBB designs a non-* based-sauce, no.  Well, maybe for the pork.  And only if I was carrying a bottle of bbq sauce in my purse.1 star each for the pulled pork, sweet potato pie, and for Rich being such a sport.  (Kudos for letting me sample the pie!  Letting people sample is always good for business!).  p.s.  If HB had a shack that only sold sweet potato pie, I'd give it 5 stars!p.p.s.  Honey Bear BBQ, please add candied yams/sweet potatoes to your menu!  While you're at it, add some sweet potato fries, as well!Allergy update: I concluded that the sweet potato pie must contain * ingredients bec. I went through two days of horrible allergy symptoms.  I won't be able to enjoy it anymore, but for those w/out allergies, do give it a try!Big  Thank you to Honey Bears to start off, why you ask ? Because they were open ! Wish I could give a 1/2 star extra for that.  Listen Downtown!  you   want me  to bring my family and friends down on the weekend,you want us to explore downtown and use the metro rail,   we need some family friendly , hopefully locally owned,  places to eat !  So 1 big ole star for that!  Now for the rest ...Honey Bears has that  hole in the wall , down south feel to me , and that alone will probably bring me back at sometime .  Especially if I have kids with me otherwise it's Switch, Matt's or Fez. Okay and now for the hits:This is a  good  place for pulled pork or BBQ chicken sandwich ...don't stray from that and you will be happy , husband and kiddos gave a big two thumbs up for that... lil mini me had a 1/2 chicken dinner  w/o BBQ sauce ( weirdo)  and pronounced it good.  Mine were  ribs which were very small, not meaty and I had trouble with tang of the vinegar based sauce.(BTW hubby loved it ) Portions were big on everything but my ribs.  Faux Daughter number 2 couldn't finish her sandwich. I could eat a big ole plate of the mac and cheese wow cheesey goodness... kids agreed.Fries were rumored to be good , one of my kids said  better than in -n-out the others shot her a dirty look .. so you try them and see. Loved the coleslaw and I wouldn't  share it with anyone .Corn was good but not memorable. They have RC and Seven up products which goes to show it's old school I guess. If you can't abide by that bring your own I guess. Service was great, the dude taking our order was personable, helpful and patient with our big order. They also redid mini me's order when it first came with BBQ sauce. Place is nicer than Stacey's for ambiance but I don't really look for that with BBQ , do you?Five dollars and thirty cents for a pulled pork sandwich with a side of sauce? Sorry, Honey Bear's, but I'm not feeling you. Why, oh why, did I go on a day when they didn't serve catfish, which I love from here. Perhaps when I blow off some steam over a sandwich this small with no side dishes costing over $5 I'll return for your fish fry. Until then, see ya.This is legit, I ordered combo #2 at 2:45 pm 3-1-14 and at 3:40 pm I had to walk to the counter and ask how much longer my food was going to be, the reply was 5 minutes there is one order ahead of you.NO "i am sorry for the wait, let me see whats taking so long." Nothing.I replied with you have three minutes or I want a refund. Well 5 goes by, Ok I want a refund. It took about another 5 minutes for him to get permission from his "manager" whom may or may not have even graduated high school. At this point I have been robbed 1 hour of my life, with no apologizes, with no interaction with management, or any  sense of customer service.  There would be a zero star here if i had the option. Absolutely yummy food, when properly serviced. I mean their was not one single resemblance of an adult in this establishment. Its like they all got high in the back and had no sense of time, or surroundings. I understand if you have a few new people that you are training. But WTF....Oh and on the way out some one told me calm down...Me calm down you robbed my of an hour of my life, made me hungrier than what i was, and told me to calm down. That is not how you deescalate a situation. Never again Honey bears will I treat you to my hard earned money. And frankly the gentleman before me should have been more furious than me, he called in his order and sandwich with whatever side, you handed him a bag with a side of sauce, no apologizes for him or any of your other LOYAL customers. Dam I am MAD.                                    Thanks for nothing,                                                        Augustina AKA ROBBEDThis was my first time to this place and probably the last! When you walk in to any service business you expect a certain amount of kindness and professionalism. Well not here. we were met with a rude cashier who kept screaming NEXT as if there was no one in line. Next I saw all these signs telling you what you can't do in this place like do not dump anything in the soda dispenser drain and check your order before you leave and so on. Finally when we were able to place a order the extremely rude cashier seemed so irritated that we actually had the nerve to enter this place that she had no desire to even take our order or answer any questions that we had. The price was decent but on the expensive side, 20 dollars for 2 people without drinks. So we finally get our order and knowing that i have to check my bag because i read the sign that had it printed in BOLD letters, I noticed that I was missing my potato salad. So the rude cashier looks over and says WHAT. And I said I'm missing my potato salad so she opens the cooler and basically throws it at me with very good accuracy as if she has done this many times. So then my brother asked her if she missed his potato salad also and she screams out I DON'T KNOW CHECK YOUR BAG, As if she has somehow forgotten what she put in there 30 seconds ago. Bottom line food is good but it's not worth the effort you have to go through to get it. The staff is so bad that I will go out of my way to go somewhere else. The owners should be aware that the service of this place has gotten to the point that people won't even go there so they don't have to deal with the worst service they have ever had. In todays economy where people are choosing carefully where to spend their money you need to have something special and this place should put up a big sign that says:GO AWAY WE DON'T WANT YOUR MONEY!!!!!They will never get anymore of mine.
My Wine Cellar=I took my staff here for a happy hour retirement party for our boss.  The service was prompt and attentive, the ambiance was nice, with soft lighting and non-intrusive music playing in the background, and the meat and cheese platters and bruschetta I ordered were all delicious.  This was a hit with the staff and I can easily see coming back here for another event soon.
Sacks Art of Sandwicherie=Looking for a casual lunch spot with moderate prices and a large selection of sandwiches, salads, drinks, etc...? Look no further than Sacks.  Not only do they deliver on the attributes I mention above, but they also deliver literally (with a minimum $25 order and they charge just a gratuity that goes to the driver).I used to frequent this Sacks when they were located at 48th St and Indian School, and just recently remembered that they relocated just down the street at 42nd and Indian School.  I've been several times in the last few weeks and have been a satisfied customer for sure.  I usually go for their Cobb Salad (no onion and add avocado) with balsamic dressing.  I love that Sacks is fine with modifications to their menu items!  I'm also a fan of their egg salad, the Sacks Symphony Sandwich, and the Sacks Impressionist Sandwich.  I love that they have Snapple drinks and lots of iced tea fountain options as well as Sun Chips!  Their cookies (they come with every meal) are another nice perk if you're not watching your sweet intake!I must say, I do miss the crackers that they used to serve with the salads awhile back.  Perhaps they will bring those back sometime soon?!I have yet to take advantage of the delivery service mentioned above, but I do plan on using that in the future when I can't get away to pick up or eat there.  Glad to have yet another reliable lunch option in the hood!
Primanti Bros=Have you ever watched them make this sandwich?  It's a special craft for sure.  They take two pieces of white Italian bread.  Pile on your choice of meat and cheese....then the grand finale....cole slaw and fries!  Then the put both hands on the sandwich and proceed to smoosh it all down flat. All this is done with their bare hands, no gloves here, so all you sanitary peeps beware! I don't know why it's such a fantastic sammy, but trust, it is!  I think it's just the combination of delicious (and fatty) ingredients that does the job.  It's just one more food experience that makes Pittsburgh's dining unique. If you're visiting Pittsburgh, go here?  If you're new to Pittsburgh, go here! If you just need your fill of a sandwich with more sides on it than you usually order in a regular sitting, go here!A solid 4-stars for a solid-as-hell sandwich! I mean, why mess with silverware?...just pile all those side dishes (slaw and fries) between those buns and get to work. You should be full for approximately 29 hours. On a recent beautiful day in Pittsburgh, my pal Rachel C and I popped over to Primanti Bros. Of course, an institution...visitors must at least try it once. Like Deep Dish pizza in Chicago or bagels in New York. You just gotta, ok? Locals seem to be split on whether its worth it...so, saddle on up to give it a shot yourself. Sitting outside on Market Square in the sunshine (and with Batman filming in the near distance!), we embarked on my first Primanti experience. Bros is right...these are definitely NOT dainty sandwiches, by any means! DO not come here on a first date, there is literally no way to eat this beast politely. My turkey and cheese was a "lighter" option, if that exists...but I will still full for the requisite 29 hours or so. Did it blow my mind? No. Did I find it fun and interesting and did it taste good? YES! Wash it down with a Diet Coke and we were set to jet to take Pittsburgh by storm the rest of the day. Or, needed a nap. Wear the stretchy pants. *accepts credit cards*great for groups*very quick *friendly serviceI like sandwich and stuff as much as anyone else. this place was pretty good. The prices were good also. the staff was good. Everything worked out the way it should. There were no negative surprise. No poistive surprises either. It was a nice resturant.
Bar-B-Q King=We saw this place on Diners Drive-ins & Dives, just like so many others, and decided to give it a try on our way to Asheville today.And...I am soooo glad we did!First...yes, the intercom system is dated, and hard to hear, oh well...I chalk that up to character. We didn't know what to order, so my lovey hubby went inside to ask what they recommended. David asked him, "How many you got?" And proceeded to invite us inside to sit and eat...they only have 2 stools, and we felt happy to be invited. (He also said, "bring your missus inside, and we'll take care of you.)The inside is just as dated as the intercom...but, we asked what to order and they recommended the BBQ chicken and BBQ pork plate.Now, I must admit, we are from Augusta, and as true Augustians, we have one BBQ love...Sconyers...it is simply the best in the world, and we have been bred to eat it.But, BBQ King does a real decent job of the pork!!! I was happy to share the plate with my lovey hubby, and we enjoyed it...the sauce was Texas Pete based...and very tasty.I must give a mention to their cole slaw...they have a "secret" ingredient, which just happens to be MY secret ingredient also!!! Celery seeds... and they really make for a tasty slaw! (try it next time you make cole slaw...it is so good!)I've saved the best for last...their BBQ dipped fried chicken. Now, I saw this on Guy Fieri's show...and didn't think it could be good at all...I thought, "Fried chicked, dipped in sauce??? It'll get all soggy...won't be good at all..." Well, folks...I was WRONG. They fry it so crispy...then dip it at the last minute before serving...so you get this absolutely delicious, crispy, juicy, tender BBQ chicken. I will go on record as saying: BEST BBQ CHICKEN EVER...possibly the best fried chicken ever!!! It really is that good...it is incredible and original...and I can't believe that every where doesn't serve chicken like this.Last, but not least...get the cherry sun-drop...yes, it is sun-drop, but with cherry syrup...I've never had it anywhere else. (I'm very sheltered, obviously!)BBQ King (which was featured on Diner, Drive-ins an Dives) is my go-to for comfort food for those days that happen once in a while ... Bad days, good days, days where it's raining outside, days where the scale is in my favor, days when the scale has a glitch and I'm five pounds heavier, days between Sunday and Monday, etc. I love the BBQ Friend Chicken. Great taste. Good value. Nom. Nom. Nom.Location: 3/5It's right on Wilkinson which is a pretty big, busy 4-lane roadway if not divided highway. Not the easiest to navigate into and out of but it's well worth the hassle and potential car wreck.Atmosphere / Ambiance: 3/5 BBQ King is an old-school drive-in joint where the car hops come to you car with your grub after you placed your order in a Charlie's Angels speaker-box. Think of Sonic but ya know, like back in the 60's and stuff. It probably hasn't been updated much since then either. But yeah, who's going here for a date? PSA: I would love to be brought here for a date, but that's just me. Cleanliness: 4/5See above.The facilities are dated but my food has also been on point in terms of hair to food ratio. Service: 4/5The Car Hops are cordial and friendly. The staff inside are likely as well.Food: 5/5Dear Little Baby Jesus, that BBQ Fried Chicken is amazing. It stays crispy even while slathered in tangy BBQ sauce. I can't string the words together that'll do justice to this culinary masterpiece. I love BBQ and I love fried chicken and I have become some what of an aficionado so yeah, I know my stuff. You will not be disappointed. The hush-puppies are legit too.
Tacos De Juarez=Gentrification be damed, this place is still (barely) standing. First off let me warn you that the salsa that comes with the chips is HOT. Not just a little spicy - like 5 alarm rip your own tongue out hot.That aside, the food here is really good. I usually order 3 rolled chicken tacos with gaucamole or the cheese enchiladas. They never get it wrong. Everything on the menu is cheap, fast and damn good. They are also speedy with the drink refills which always rocks.Also, you can actually catch a bus to Jaurez from their parking lot as the local scary bus to Mexico departs from the depot next door. That is pretty hot too."Are you kidding me Laura?!?!""OMG we are going to get shot!!""Dude this is a fucking double wide."This is what I heard upon entering the parking lot. "Hell yes we are eating here I don't care what you say!!"I like it no matter if Veronica R (my sister) did not like their green chili. Its a taco place order the tacos!! Yes the rice was overcooked and a bit crunchy hopefully its not like that all the time. The beans were FANTASTICO they tasted like the ones my Abuelita used to make. The salsa was not for the weak its nice and spicy just how I like it. I had the shrimp tacos as my entree see pics, they were delicious I cleaned my plate!!Cheapest beer ever I had a Bohemia for $2.50 they are $6 anywhere else!! We also took some Horchata and a Mansanita glass bottle to go mmmm. This place was clean and reminded me of Mexico inside, if I am in the area I would not hesitate to stop in here for a bite.Shout out to Danny S for recommending! TY!!five stars is simply not enough.i was always scared to try this place. i don't even think i knew it was still a functioning restaurant. i'm glad i was wrong.so two gringos walk into a mexican taco shop next to a mexican bus station....badump bump.OMG!! wtf have i been missing here. i got a carne asada burro and a soft chicken taco...taco was awesome. the corn tortilla was soft, supple and tasted awesome. piled high with lettuce some sliced radish and i squeezed some lemon ontop. i murdered this taco. execution style. imagine finding a duffle bag full of heads in Juarez...well this taco belonged to one of those heads..understand?the burro was very tasty. the meat seasoned well and only two bites did i find some grisly bits. the carne asada was rolled up with some diced tomatoes and a cup of pico on the side. i kinda prefer my CA Burrito with a heap of Guacamole like how FilliB's makes them. but this was really tasty and i will order it again...after i check out the other items on the menu of course. you will now find me here every saturday morning. the tacos at Tacos De Juarez will soon refer to me as the Chalupacabre.Power yoga class today. What great way to detox your body and find all the muscles and balance points you rarely use (you'll find them the hard way, BTW, but that's another story).As I was lying on the mat at the end of the class, listening to Max (our instructor/Chief Yogi), telling us to just be and to try to not think...try not to eat or drink for an hour after the session and just let our bodies detox, all I could think of was "what can I eat to retox as quickly as possible, that won't kill me where I stand?"Not an easy question to ponder, even with the existential power of yoga still pulsating through every fiber of my being...a chili dog from Ted's or Long Wong's?; an Italian Beef  from Luke's; Chicken and waffles from Lolo's?And then it hit me, almost causing me to stir from my yoga induced coma, Taco's de Juarez!!!!!As anyone who has read even one of my reviews will tell you, I am a "Trendinista" of the first order. I follow the herd, make no mistake about it! Why?Because, occasionally, the herd knows where it's going...and this is one of those very special occasions!I had spotted this place before...on my way by at high speed, to get to Welcome Diner for a burger.But since I wasn't packing, I never, ever stopped rolling, let alone got out of my car here. Yelp changed all that. This place has some terrific reviews, in spite of the fact that there isn't a Betos or Bertos in sight. Worth a try, right?Taco's of Juarez is a delightfully dirty little gem...the proverbial diamond in a goat's ass. I sat down and the sweet little non-english speaking waitress brought chips and salsa...The Two Grinders (Los Dos Molino's) need to take salsa lessons from these folks...some of the best salsa I have had (the salsa verde is definitely the best I've had in the US...makes me long for couple of places along the beach in Bahia de Navidad).In an effort to retox as quickly as possible, I ordered the number 16 lunch especial...a shredded beef gordita ("gordita" means "meat wrapped in lard, then deep-fried" in Spanish) and a cerveza (ice, ice cold BTW).Freakishly good...I know, it was almost pure lard that had been heated to point where it lost its molecular cohesion and liquefied...but it was damn tasty lard. I forked a little salsa chile and salsa verde onto the gordita (accompanied by refritos and rico) and dug in.I awoke to shouts of "clear" as the feverish paramedics worked to restart my heart...just kidding! I am fine:) !!So, go to the pawn shop and find yourself a nice little Sig Sauer 9mm pistol and holster, turn on the car alarm and go try Taco's of Juarez. Possibly the best Mexican food in town!And now, another one on my list of favorite places to retox after I've detoxed!I ended the work week on a nice note when I met Donald S and a new friend at Tacos De Juarez for lunch on Friday.  We enjoyed good conversation amidst the early Goodwill high back dining chairs, the Formica tables mixed with the old Ethan Allen desks serving as tables (thanks for that insight Mark) and crowd of diners from a broad swath of life.The chips were good, standard stuff.  The red and green salsa was also tasty, although the red is mild bordering on hot and the green is just hot.  I recommend waiting until your drink arrives before starting in on the green salsa.I wanted 2 enchiladas.  They come with cheese and I wanted one with cheese and one with chicken added.  There was a bit of language difficulty and I ended up with 2 chicken enchiladas.  But let me start with the basics because that is where my judgment of a Mexican restaurant begins:  rice and beans.  If they miss on the basic rice and beans then they will have a hard time getting me back.  The rice and beans were good.  Not greasy, not dry.  Great.  On to the enchiladas.The chicken enchiladas were smothered in a generous amount of enchilada sauce and cheese and filled with a hearty portion of stewed chicken.  Good stuff.I will absolutely add Tacos De Juarez to my list of good & cheap restaurants.  And having been in the El Paso/Juarez area recently I can say that even though the neighborhood immediately surrounding Tacos De Juarez looks a little sketchy it is not.  For example there were no poor souls executed and left hanging from a chain link fence here as there was a couple weeks ago along the border.
Islands Restaurant=We were out this way yesterday just exploring and when we drove by my daughter said that looking like a good place so we had an early dinner there.  I like the atmosphere, cool and laid back, very island like.  There is surfing stuff all over and surfing videos on and the staff is friendly and laid back too.  We had great service.  Drinks arrived promptly and we were checked on several times during the meal.  My daughter had an accident with her milkshake and our server brought her another one quickly, napkins to wipe up with, and wet wipes for her sticky hands.  I had the Baja soft tacos.  They were good but lacking something...I dont know what though.  I had guac, sour cream and salsa too.  They were good but they needed more flavor.  Maybe it was the way the chicken was cooked, I'm not sure.  My daughter had a kid's meal of a hot dog and fries and she ate it all.  I would probably go back and try a burger sometime.Mostly I thought the atmosphere was good, very island ish and I liked it.I've been a diner at Island's for a very long time and they have never failed me. You always know what to expect when you walk in the door. I love a restaurant that can be so consistent for so long! Some of my favorite dishes include their burger (always a good choice), their quesadilla, the tortilla soup (my favorite!!), the cheese fries or plain fries, the chicken tenders, their Shorebird sandwich (LOVE), their BLT, and their Yaki Tacos. As you can see I've tried a lot of their menu options and have enjoyed them all. Island's is a reliable, yummy restaurant that the whole family can enjoy. I will always be a customer!!
Bell' Italia Pizzeria=I brought my boyfriend here as a date for his birthday. We were very surprised at how small it was! The decor was cute and the tables were pretty close together but we liked the homey and family feel of the restaurant. We did have a reservation and I would recommend getting one if you plan on eating there in a high volume time. As it was we still had to wait a few minutes but our waiter was very attentive and helpful. We started with just the bread. It honestly wasn't anything special but it was good and we really enjoyed the seasoning and balsamic that came with it. We couldn't decide whether we wanted pasta or pizza so we settled on sharing both pasta and pizza. The waiter suggested that we try to the bolognese pasta and that came out first. The sauce was so tasty and the pasta with the cheese inside was cooked so perfectly. It was really awesome. When the pizza came out we were a little weary because it didn't look like anything special but we were so wrong! It was sooooo good. We got whole pepperoni and half sausage and half black olives. The pizza was hands down the best thing we have had in this city. We recommend it to anyone who enjoys pizza. My boyfriend was especially happy because his family is Italian so he is very picky about what Italian food he likes and he LOVED this food. The prices were well worth the food and not too expensive. GREAT for a date night! We live in Scottsdale but we will definitely be making the trip to Chandler to eat here every once in a while....with a reservation of course :).
Coronado Cafe=Cozy, cute and yes, a little claustraphobic...Coronado Cafe. Perhaps the latter adjective is my own issue, but at 5 foot  9 inches I felt REALLY tall. An adorable little home, with creaky wooden floors transformed into a comfortable cafe with approachable American fare. After navigating the dicey, sandy, lumpy parking lot I accidentally entered the kitchen door. My bad. I was redirected to another door and entered through the rear. Yikes did I  just say I entered through the rear? Anyway a lovely staff person told me to go to the front and check in. Meandering through the cafe I really did find it lovely. Very neat, old yet modern and strangely very loud. It was a booming lunch crowd on a Monday. Taking Mom and Dad out for a Mother's Day lunch. We waited a few minutes for a table and were constantly being said hello to and asked if we've been helped by a friendly, friendly staff. Shout out to the staff! The menu, while not especially inventive, seemed fresh and yummy. The soup of the day was a tortilla soup with its own stamp on it. No tortilla strips atop the cup, yet and especially flavorful soup, creamy with a twinge of tanginess to it. Mom and I both had the turkey sandwich with cranberrry sauce. HUGE mother of a sandwich. I always wonder about the big sandwich because you cannot possible bite into it without making a mess. Not a strike against them, cuz it was very good, bread was fresh and turkey seemed unprocessed. Dad ordered the ham and cheese, but stripped away all the interesting flavors, because, well, because he's a dad and likes the meat and potato type menu. Dessert was a wonderful and decedent brownie with ice cream, chocolate and caramel sauces. Very good. Brownie was more like a cake though. Again, no complaint, cuz it was dee-lish. Service was so great I have to say. Friendly, professional and fun. I like the idea of eating in an old house. The contrast of old Phoenix with striking photography of modern New York strewn about the rooms was quite cool. I recommend a visit. I'm craving the tortilla soup and would love to try other items on the menu. Most importantly it was a wonderful way to hang with mom and dad (who ventured in from Sun City in their mini van, navigating the Central Ave. mess, God Bless 'em) and we truly had a good experience. Coronado Cafe. Cute. Cozy. Comfortable. And in the end, not so claustraphobic.Coronado Cafe has character!  What a nice change from the strip mall restaurants that make up most of the Valley.  It's a cute little house, friendly enough staff, and pleasant menu as well.I've been twice so far and was pleased both times.  Once, awhile back, for dinner - Jared and I sat outside (it was obviously not the summer) and had a delightful little date... If I recall, we had one of their homemade soups and a fish special of the day.  Most recently, I met Katie F there for a perfect girlfriend/business lunch.  We met on a Thursday at noon.  I actually arrived a bit early but they will not seat you unless the full party is there.  Not a problem, I had a refreshing raspberry iced tea while i waited.  We were seated promptly when Katie arrived - in a back room that was quiet enough to talk and actually hear each other!  Katie went with the chicken pasta and I opted for the Cobb Salad (I was told it is the newest addition to the menu).  We were both happy with our meals and practically cleaned our plates.  The dressing for the Cobb has a kick; be forewarned, but I enjoyed it.  We didn't leave room for dessert, but the menu was tempting.  Thanks Coronado Cafe for bringing some character to the Valley - I'll be back to see you soon!In the hot AZ summer going to Coronado island is a great idea, however if you can't make the commute the Coronado Cafe is a great 2nd choice.This place has everything you need for a great date.Quaint and romantic old house setting and patios.Table cloths and faux candlesMenu full of artfully presented itemsWines by the glass or bottleBackground music in lieu of background noise.We started our meal with a gargonzola salad, which they did a split plating for us. $6 The greens were fresh the cheese was bountiful and pungent the walnuts were candied and the slices of apple were crisp, what more could you want from a salad?For our main dishes we had the Cherve Rellnos $12, Two large pablano chilies stuffed with well dices zucchini other veggies and goat cheese on top of a generous pile of polenta and a roasted red pepper sauce, it was amazing.The other main was miso glazed salmon with sauted spinach and basmati rice. The fish had a nice crisp crust, the spinach had a nice flavor and the rice was well just rice, it could use a veggie in it to to spice it up.Bottles of wine start at a affordable $12The meal included bread with olive oil.Bottom line great romantic place for dinner or lunch.Never sat on the patio before...  Love that it is November and we can sit outside and enjoy the weather!  The staff is super friendly and always aiming to please.  I ordered the Blanco Flatbread (roasted garlic cream, mozzarella, parmesan-reggiano, and added roasted chicken).  Less the onions for me on this.  It is crispy, light, and delish!  I tried a slice of the Carne Flatbread from Shane's plate.  YUM!!!  The spicy was the right amount.I've never been to Maryland, but I'm pretty sure CC marries their best with old school Phoenix's best.I'll start with what I don't like: I don't come often enough. That's it. My raves: Cutest house turned classy restaurant ever. I've been discovering more & more places like this and CC is by far my favorite. It still feels like walking into mamas kitchen except you get first class service & it's not free ;)Look out for Triple J! Jillian, Janel, & JR always take great care of me!! They all have great attitudes, very personable, and know the menu very well. You can't go wrong with the crab cakes!! Or the miso salmon, mmmm!! Any seafood really. I've complained about my salmon not being cooked properly at other restaurants but that is not an issue here!!I also love the Gorgonzola salad, chicken Caesar wrap, and meatloaf!!!As others have mentioned, it's a great date place whether your date is a spouse, friend, or family member. I noticed a lot of people come in before a play- perfect ambiance for a romantic evening.Get a sitter for the kids- I would give you a Samantha Jones style stare down if you brought in loud grubby children who would definitely ruin my dinner in a cozy place like this. ( I am a nanny who loves children as well as dining out with children. But I also believe in adults having their happy place considering I don't go to the playground with cigarettes & beer to be in the way of 12 & under spring break! Thanks.)Parking lot works, location is great- super close to I-10, but far enough away to not have the noise while on the patio. Sometimes I come in just for a beer since I am in the neighborhood a lot and just melt into that patio. I'll be back soon! (Maybe tonight!)*Tip- Call ahead
Ruth's Chris Steak House=I used to like their foodHonestly.It was my one year anniversary.Me and me man went here to celebrateI had a lobster tailAnd a filetOn the way home, I got violently illLike, within ten minutes of leaving this place.And no, I only had a few glasses of champagne :)I ended up going home, and laying on the floor for awhile crying, moaning, vomiting, etcAfter about an hour, I couldn't take it anymoreI called 911The paramedics showed up, I was naked and crying on the floor.It was a VERY romantic anniversary, let me tell you.After a long night at Scottsdale Osborn hospital, it was determined that the lobster tail was undercooked/tainted and made me severly ill.I'll never eat here again.Simply because I've never been so sick.It's a shame though, because on the way down, the lobster tail had these cajun seasonings and really was exceptionally delicious.HOWEVERI contacted Ruths Chris and they refunded my dinner amount, paid my hospital copay, and were SOOO nice and accomodating to my every demand.  Bravo.Although, Boo for almost killing me.Eh, I'm torn.
Mimosa Grill=Folks, hands down this has to be one of the best brunch spreads in Charlotte!!! I met some girlfriends here for brunch on Sunday afternoon. I scored a parking space on the street but they do offer valet and there are plenty of parking garages. The inside of this place is gorgeous. There's plenty of beautiful tile work and it's all windows in the dining area so you'll have a great view. In the warmer months, there's even a lovely patio section! For Sundays there is no regular menu! It's brunch or nothing! But that was totally fine with me! It's one price for all the brunch and tapas plates (mini omelets, french toast, eggs benedict) you can eat.  That brunch bar is loaded! It's got everything:Mac and cheese (cheesy goodness) A Grits Bar (Yep! There are tons of toppings like ham, cheese and bacon crumbles to add if naked grits aren't your thing)Smashed brown potatoes (like hash browns but 10x better) Peel and eat shrimpBiscuits and gravy (mouthwatering good) Herb Crusted Prime rib (tender and delish) SalmonBacon and Sausage EggsShrimp and Grits The grits were nice and creamy! Just the way they should be. And the shrimp were tossed in a gravy sauce mixed with andouille sausage and spinach. With just the right amount of spice and flavor...I could eat this every day!Chili (forget everything you know because it's freaking fantastic) Whew! I'm sure I'm missing a ton of things but it's more than enough variety for you to make sure you leave full and happy. What the heck are you waiting for? Oh and if you somehow manage to have room left after sampling all those goodies....they have chocolate covered strawberries! Yum!
Wongs To Go=Located in the deep hood on the southside, near the corner of 7th street & Roser in between a liquor store and a recreation center infront of the high school that still holds the record of most student sponsored riots and most confiscated guns in the Nation. Nestled in the crossroads of three of the largest gang's territory in the state, Wong's To Go has been a firm establishment in what can be a very chaotic environment. I personally love the southside... it's tension, it's colorful characters and colorless buildings are beautiful to me.Open primarily for lunch, Wong's has been open for along as anyone can remember. A serious hole in the wall needs to be approached with serious caution - not because of it's surroundings... but because of the curt and often moody cashier. "WAI!" screeched the elderly Chinese woman as she slid the take out window open. "Nee Hoy Sha Yin-Wah-ma?" I asked to the amazment of my good friend Jackie who has never heard me say a word of Chinese in her life. "English?! YES! You speak Chinese?!" She said as her face brightened up. "Wahhh hoy shwah id-yar." Indicating that I only spoke a lil bit of Chinese. We quickly ordered from their very limited menu with limitless flavor. One order of 4 pieces of chicken wings (the entire wing btw) and a quart of beef fried rice. Standing around in tiny parking lot talking about whatever, I noticed how there was a small fridge displaying different energy drinks and sodas. and my friend explained how there used to be picnic tables and even shade for ppl to wait under while their food was being prepared. After the riots between rival gangs, during which one gang used the tables as a randez vous point - the city had asked the Wong's to take out the tables. She described to me how there used to be an open window like in fast food places and how after getting robbed on evening - the wong's changed their hours to closing during the early evening and now have large bars over their windows. I really felt for the Wong's to put so much into their business only to have the tremultous neighborhood love them so much and at the same time be the cause of much of their woes. Just as I was beginning to wonder off into oblivion - our order was up and it was gooooood!!The chicken was crispy and simply fried. No batter, no dredge - nothing... it was delish! As was the beef fried rice that boasted sprouts and a lil char that Jackie requested. Burnt bits are good!  yum! Our entire order was $10! We drove away as a gagle of teenagers hungry after their last class walked up to place their orders. To my fellow yelpers: The southside is a place that is special to my heart. Perseverant, rough and colorful... there are places where it can be scary to venture into... but stay on the main roads and be a polite driver and you should be alright. Go and pay the Wong's a visit but don't be surprised if Mrs. Wong isn't exactly a happy camper. lol. Try the chicken wings, they're GREAT!
Teutonia Mannerchor=The Teutonia Männerchor is a private club promoting German cultural traditions in the Pittsburgh area. It has over 2,000 members from all walks of life. Mostly, the Männerchor is known for its Ratskeller bar and lunch restaurant and the many German cultural food festivals it has throughout the year. At Lunch, you often find a good German buffet and inexpensive German beers from their bar. Their German cultural festivals are usually well done and very authentic, but mostly populated by an older crowd. Membership (or the company of a member) is required to eat at the Ratskeller for lunch, but non members can attend their German festivals. This place is by far the most "authentic" German club in the area and the food is mostly good. The beer selection is great and the prices for everything are reasonable. If you like German food or have a connection to Germany, you should try this place at least once.
Canyon Cafe=After reading all the other reviews of this place I have determined one thing. You all were obviously on crack when you ate here. Or maybe they gave you crack when you ate here...either way my experience was not the same.Went at about 4:00 on a Saturday, not a busy time for a restaurant so I wasn't scared away when we were the only ones in the entire place, next time, I'll make sure to think twice.They started us off with chips and salsa, and I'm rather shocked that no one has mentioned their chips are a total fail. Salsa was decent, but the chips were an assortment of sweet potato chips, stale blue corn chips, sweet fried chips (sugar and everything), and stale normal tortilla chips. All in one bowl. If they weren't stale, the blue corn and normal chips would have paired nicely with the salsa. But rubbery sweet potato (don't get me wrong, I like sweet potato)  and sugar coated with salsa? Really?We decided that we were going to order an appetizer and then a meal to split, and I love a good artichoke-anything so I ordered the artichoke dip. When it came out (like 20 minutes later) I had to ask them if they brought us the right dish. It was a bowl of queso and no matter how hard I searched, there was not an artichoke to be found. They didn't bring us any other chips to go with it, and let me tell you, sweet potato chips and queso don't go so great together. To make it worse, the menu said it was $6.99 but they charged us $7.79, if it was good I wouldn't have cared so much about $0.80 as I do.I thought a good beef fajita dish with a cup of chicken tortilla soup would be a safe bet, but they couldn't even do that right. They brought out corn and flour tortillas with the fajitas. Word of advice, if they ask you which you prefer save yourself the trouble and get the flour. The corn ones were so wet that they literally tore to shreds when I tried to peel them off each other. There wasn't a whole lot of beef in the beef fajitas either, and what was there was lacking in good flavor. And for the soup, Half Moon Sports Grill makes a better tortilla soup than this place...and they're a sports grill. Overall, food was bad. Service was very slow considering we were the only ones there, and I would never, ever eat here again. Did I mention they didn't give us silverware? We had to go steal it off another table.The other day my coworkers and I decided to go to Canyon Cafe.  Also this restaurant used to be called Sam's Cafe.    They changed names back in February.  So, we got our drinks and we order the Queso dip to start our meal off and then we ordered our food.   Then the Queso dip came out.  It was really good, but it was also a little runny.  Now for our food, when they were handing us the food.  The lady was passing the fajitas across me to my coworker and the juice from the fajitas spilled all over me and my meal.  Luckily I had my napkin in my lap, but it still got on my jeans.  You would think that a manager would come over and apologize for what happen or at least comp my food.  Instead they told me that they would pay for my dry cleaning bill, if I wanted to get my jeans dry cleaned.    Other than the spill the meal was great. I ordered the basin Meatloaf. I totally recommend the meatloaf.  It was one the best meatloaf I have had in a long time.  Last but not least our waiter was really nice and did a great job taking care of us.This place has so much promise, I need to come back and try it again!  The chips and salsa are spectacular.  The service was quite slow, but the restaurant was also quite busy.  It still took an hour and 15min and all I ordered was a salad.  Don't get the Calamari Salad if it is on special.  I should have known better than to get that at a TexMex restaurant, but lesson learned.  The dressing was very good, but the calamari was over-fried and the cucumbers were mushy and disgusting.  Long story short, for lunch I had lettuce with good dressing and amazing chips and salsa for $15.  I saw plates of tacos go by that looked and smelled much better than what I was mulling through.  The waitress felt bad though, she could tell I was not enjoying my meal.  As a consolation prize I was hooked up with a delicious white chocolate tamale when I got my bill.  I will be back, I will choose more wisely, and hopefully things will be better!
Kim's Chinese Kitchen=In spite of the name on the glass facade, they do not  (or no longer) make dimsum. In fact, the main exterior signage just says, "Kim's Chinese Food." It's a regular take-out place that serves good, standard Chinese take-out dishes. It's strictly take-out, no dine-in.
Hillstone Restaurant=Awful, awful customer service - so bad in fact that we were too thoroughly disgusted to stay for the meal. We came here on a Sunday afternoon, which was my first and last time.  I've been to other Houston's locations in California - and have had decent times there.  In fact, I love the thai steak salad. However, this time some 20 year old idiot host walked us to our table (and before we even sat down) and told us "My mom taught me good manners, so I've always taken my hat off at the dinner table."  Huh?  First of all, I was dressed nicely in a button up shirt, and was wearing my favorite football team hat who had just won the championship the day before.  Secondly, I hadn't even sat down at the table yet, asswipe.  Thirdly, while I understand this isn't Applebees, this also isn't Ruth's Chris Steakhouse, douche bag.  And don't talk to me like I'm 7 years old.No sooner had the idiot host left before we walked into the kitchen to get the manager  to bitch him out about his insulting employee.  The manager was pretty much dismissive.  Well, guess what - I'm pretty much dismissive about this poor excuse for a restaurant. 1 STAR - not going back!!Houston's - you have not let me down yet... I've been on numerous occasions to this location, and I have not one complaint.  Today for lunch, I met my friend and future yelper Ryan H, and I not only enjoyed the amazing company, but the meal itself.  I chose the ahi tuna salad and a side of spaghetti squash.  Each bite of salad was better than the next; i especially love the dressing, avocado, sesame seeds, mango, and ginger... yum!  And as if the salad wasn't enough food, I had to order the side of spaghetti squash since it's a daily special and I love it so much! Ryan had the ribs and seemed to enjoy those as well!A few weeks ago Jared and I were at this location before seeing a movie at the Esplanade Theater upstairs... we each had a glass of wine and shared the veggie plate which was also divine!  Albeit a bit pricey, but worth the splurge...I'll for sure continue to frequent both this Houston's and the Scottsdale location - one of the few 'chains' in AZ that are worth it.Dependable. Like your favorite uncle who would always sneak you sips of beer. Dependable.Like shrinkage after a cold shower.Dependable.Well. Like Depends undergarments. Houston's. Solid. Dependable. And you know what? Damn tasty! Rickie and I had a pre Slumdog Millionaire lunch and shared the Hickory burger and the oh so famous spinach dip. First off, I have to say I forgot how much I LOVE the fries at Houston's. Totally my fave in all of fry land. The burger was cooked MW as Rickie requested and come out MW. I'm more of a MR kinda guy, but even at MW, this burger did not disappoint. Service is really great. We all know that. It was less robotic than I remember and for that I was grateful. God, I hate those forced, learned corporate bullshit greetings! Ugh...folks here seemed to actually have their own personality! Wow. Thank you Stepford Houston's. Have you loosened that Bolo tie recently?The crowd was uncanny for a Sunday afternoon. Rickie asked me if there was a hooker convention in town! Seriously. It was like a slut buffet parading around. Thanks Houston's. Good to know we can depend on you still. Like humidity in Houston.Or scorching summer temps in Phoenix. And asshats on the yelp threads.Chow my yelpitas!Mediocre and overpriced. There's nothing "New" about their "New American" menu and underwhelmed is the most positive spin I can place on the entire experience. It's a very limited menu with 15 dollar sandwiches and salads, or 25-30 dollar cuts of meat.  Way to cater to the vegetarians out there with a veggie burger or an overpriced "entree" of seasonal vegetables. Do restaurants have any idea how boring it is to eat a veggie burger every time you go out? Get a little creative for christsake, it's not like you're lacking possible ingredient combinations.I had the ahi tuna burger, which was ground down to a mealy consistency and cooked until bone dry.  It was then garnished with grody, unimaginative toppings like pickles and iceburg lettuce. Top it off with a cloying sweet remoulade that did nothing to moisten the sandwich and you've got a bone dry tonsil scraper. The roasted chicken was on the greasy side but well seasoned. The couscous it came with was a misstep though. Someone threw a ton of whole mint leaves into it that made it inedible instead of "fresh," which I'm sure was the intention. The spinach dip was teensy tiny for the price, and why the heck is it served with canned, crappy salsa and sour cream on the side? Weird.The fries were the one saving grace. Skin on, super slim shoestring cut with the perfect amount of salt. But I've had fried and battered bulls balls and they've tasted good. Fry anything and it'll improve the edibility. Service was nearly nonexistant, although as a whole the etiquette was top notch when it was present. But it was a complete disconnect when compared to the cruddy food being slung. You're serving a French dip sandwich, not some wild Top Chef creation. Dial back on the smug.I don't ever see a need to return to a place that serves traditional (nothing new about it!) American food I can make better in my own home. I expect more from professional chefs than chicken sandwiches and steaks.Yawn.Bye bye Phoenix Houston's, hello Phoenix Hillstone!I've been a huge fan of Houston's for years, and had mixed emotions when I heard that they were closing the Phoenix location and opening just down the street under their parent company name, Hillstone.  But after one visit, I'm sold... Hillstone has the same favorite dishes that Houston's had (spinach dip, grilled artichoke, veggie burger, fresh vegetable sides, fries, desserts, etc...) and they have a huge wine list as well.  Service is attentive and sweet (thanks McKenna who was our waitress last night).  Thanks also for going above and beyond and creating rootbeer floats for our table upon request!The Hillstone group did a fabulous job building this new restaurant - it's got a great outdoor seating area, a huge bar, an awesome wine cellar, and comfy booths inside as well.If you still want the old name (Houston's), the location in Scottsdale / Hilton Village is still open, but I highly recommend checking out Hillstone to change it up just a bit.Welcome to Phoenix, Hillstone, and yay for me... first to review!Welcome to Houston's with a happy Hillstone hat on! One thing that always bothered me about the former Houston's was how dark and dreary it could be, but that is definitely not the case with Hillstone. I absolutely love the architecture, location and openness of this building. It's fresh and airy with plenty of large windows, an open patio, and rock finishing. The restaurant seating isn't cramped and you've got plenty of room to relax and enjoy the meal with those you came with and not 20 other strangers. Before I got to Hillstone, I read up on the yelp reviews and noticed Kat S's note about the ice cubes. So, when I sat down and ordered my Diet Coke, the first thing I glanced at were the ice cubes and Kat's right! They are old fashioned and pretty great! They are the type of ice cubes they place in whiskey to make sure they don't crush when they are dropped in, but I also think they make the soda pour without fizzing up. So now I will move on to the meal. The reviews are right in saying that this is exactly like the Houston's menu but with a nice improvement. I ordered the rotisserie chicken sandwich with the couscous. Warning: the sandwich is huge and way too big for one lunch, but that could be a good thing if you want to have the other half for lunch. We didn't have dessert but I glanced at the menu and while they have several of the Houston's signatures, I think they should add apple crisp to the list. I will definitely be back to Hillstone and think this is a nice addition to the area.I had a $20 club sandwich at the Ritz Carlton in D.C. I had a $30 lobster roll at Mary's Fish Camp in Manhattan.And this weekend I had a $19 French Dip in Phoenix.All of them worth every penny. The French Dip was pure perfection, served piled high on warm, soft bread which soaked up the horseradish cream and au jus served on the side. And served with some of my favorite fries. Skinny and salty. Much like myself so I've been told.Critics pan the limited menu. Boo to you. I'm so OVER Cheesecake Factory style menus. They scare me. I will say if they claim to be New American, I don't get that. It's American. Steak house style. And the decor! I could TOTALLY move in and not change a thing! The sandstone. The masculine wood panels and burgundy booths. And I love the photography, specifically the entire wall of swimming pool photos. Hillstone. Good move!i love this restaurant so much. i have yet to have something i didn't like.i have nothing really special to add to all of the amazing reviews except to order these things:thai steak noodle salad- mango, avocado, tomatoes, noodles, marinated steak...i meannnnnnnnnnnnncaesar salad - their dressing is my fav and so are the croutonsbacon, cheddar burger- so juicy, so exquisiteroast beef sandwich- raw horseradish on the sidefries- order extra bc people will eat these babies UP! service is ALWAYS good, it's always clean, it's always pleasant. seriously, you can't have a bad time unless you're just a miserable person.IF YOU HAVE KIDS YOU MUST READ!!!My husband and I have never been more insulted at a restaurant than tonight at the Hillstone Restaurant (Biltmore).This is the same restaurant group that includes Bandera and Houston's. We deliberately went out early-- at 5pm -- with another couple and our son. He started to fuss on and off during dinner. Mind you the restaurant was already noisy when the GM Miranda Geranios instructed us to leave; other patrons were complaining. That was news to us- and we've seen far worse outbursts in the past from children. Ironically, our son at that moment was playing happily with the other couple when she rudely asserted herself. We were in the middle of dinner and to add insult to injury, she didn't even offer to compensate us for a future visit without our little guy. Just go home without dinner and pay the bill. Of course, she herself has no children. To ask a repeat customer to leave is absolutely disgusting. We will never visit any of their establishments again and wanted to share our unfortunate experience with our friends who also know the challenges of having a family.Hillstone, meet the Hillstone...Have a yabba dabba doo time, A dabba doo time, You'll have a gay old time!!!   I loved this place!! The food was awesome, the service was incredible, our server was super funny and the vibe of this place was so relaxing and fine!!My favorite thing here was the Shrimp Coconut Sushi!! MUY DELICIOSO!!!!! Oh and the Ribs are a massive thing to behold, at first I though there was no way I would even finish half but I did, it was that good I guess that eating it was a very smooth journey of pure meaty goodness that I was able to accomplish to about 3/4 of the way that was because I was full to the heart!! We really enjoyed and loved this place!! We cannot wait to go back again and sink our teeth into another dish of pure goodness!! This place is a must for those who haven't decided to go on in!! Thank us later!!! :)  High five and an A+++I know this is a chain and found that there is one in SF. We ended up coming here for a late lunch after picking up the husband and daughter from the airport when they flew into Phoenix to celebrate my Gram's 90th. My mom had yet to come here and the fact that this used to be Houston's which used to be located across the street which well, everything that once was has changed in Phoenix. My mom ordered the artichoke and claimed it was one of the best she ever had. I had one of the best house side salads ever. It had all sorts of goodies from beets to goat cheese to hidden gems of avocado. Perfect. The husband had a French Dip he said he would fly back to have again and the DD ordered seared Ahi (she is much more adventurous than I) and loved it. Service was friendly, we left full and I look forward to another experience with Hillstone.IF THERE WAS A ZERO THAT WOULD BE TOO MUCH RIGHT NOW!!!  This star used to be at the 5 mark especially due to their salads, BBQ, and French Dip!!!!  Here's the story!    To give a little background about myself it is that I am married to my husband who is 70 and I around the 40 mark.  We are opposites in sight....He is buttoned up shirt and shorts and I am full sleeved tattoos and am more of a t-shirt kinda guy (The t-shirt in question is a cartoonish glow in the dark skeletal outline)  Don't get me wrong I do dress up well when the occasion calls for it.    On July 26, 2015 at approximately 1 p.m., my spouse and I had run errands, met with people and went home, showered and put on our CLEAN weekend work clothes.  We decided we wanted a good salad and the first place that popped into my head was Hillstone.  We get to the entrance door which was propped open by I am assuming the last patrons who had exited the building.  We walk in and close the door behind us.  We are greeted by a sweet smiling you woman all in black and asks how many; we say "Two please".  She says "Right this way".  We follow her up a slightly slanted ramp to a dead end and take a right to a standard table for four.  She places down the menus on the table and my spouse begins to sit.  As I pick my chair which was the one where my back would face the window and begin to pull it out to sit, the lady in black says "Do you have a different shirt with you?"  OKAY this pissed me off!  I turned around and shooed my hands towards the table in a "whatever" type of motion and walked out mumbling things I don't wish to repeat past 3 occupied tables, pushing the door open and realizing how embarrassing that was.  I understand if there is a dress policy (Which we did not see anywhere and later are told it apparently is on one of the doors as we entered, perhaps the one we had to pull shut.  If we were told I had "inappropriate" attire on when we walked in the door at the beginning I would not be so disappointed, hurt and embarrassed. On Yelp it states that the dress is "Casual" which could mean many a thing.  I am sure professional musicians who have stepped in the doors of this establishment have not even been questioned about the dress code.    I felt I was misrepresented as a client.  The worst thing you can do is make a person feel so inferior for the most trivial reasons and think it can just be categorized under an "oops" moment.  I am not one to play the "gay" card; however, I do feel that tattoos and the appearance of someone based on their tattoos is a different card altogether.....No!  It is a different GAME altogether!  I usually let things slide off and carry on with my day, but this was humiliating.  I don't care what people think of me, but I sure as hell do care about other people like me who have the same type of situations happen to them.  For being overpriced the food WAS wonderful!  I would take clients as well as family, friends and my attorney here to eat on occasion.  I think its time to look around for less judgmental companies to accept my hard earned money.Welp, I think it is safe to say that Hillstone really never disappoints and it shows by their long wait on a Wednesday evening! {Hint Hint: Always make a reservation when coming here!} Their service is spectacular, prices are great for the quality of the food and the ambiance is cozy and romantic. I have been getting their Classic Caesar Salad with chicken for YEARS and it is the best. I am also in love with their prime rib and loaded baked potato. The sushi is fresh and fabulous too, you really can't go wrong! I know we'll be back soon for another family outing!
McDonald's=I haven't eaten food from McDonald's in years, but I've stopped by this Mickey D's location several times recently for their ice cream cones... $1.64 for two ice cream cones... you can't beat that!  And they are reduced-fat too!For those that want something fancier, they also offer McFlurries (the McDonalds version of DQ Blizzards) with toppings such as oreo cookies, M&M's and Rolos, and sundaes with hot fudge, hot caramel, and strawberry.  As their slogan goes, "I'm lovin' it!"
The Cheesecake Factory=Loved it years ago in LA....feel as though with any enormous chain restaurant, quality is suffering. Do I love that the menu is longer than the Bible? Or does it actually just drive me mad causing me to drive my salad fork into my forehead while perusing the ad-riddled pages? I'm always here for the comfort food. And I don't order those ridiculous salads, large enough to fill the salad bar at Soup Or Salad! Frankly I simply cannot digest all the raw roughage in one sitting. Cauliflower is no longer my friend. Yesterday I ordered the Hungarian Beef Ghoulash. Meet was very tender, gravy was too salty and the egg noodles that came with were a bit bland. I guess you need to ask for a gravy or sauce for them, cuz they was jest naked. Rickie's meatloaf, tasted just like my entree...I swear...I tasted no difference in the sauce. The Buffalo Chicken triangle thingy appetizer was different and tasty. Crispy, spicy triangles of lightly battered something or other filled with chicken. With so many newer places opening up all over town done in minimal/urban decor, The Cheesecake Factory really sticks out like a loud relative at a dinner party. Hmmm...will I go back? Probably...too convienent after movies at the Esplanade. And if I try everything on the menu eventually, I know I'll be navigating my walker with the yellow tennis balls attached, but I'm bound to find the fresh, consistent and comforting dish I so want.The cheesecake guys are the best. The cheesecakes are so great. foods and drinks are even better. the big problem is that you have to always wait and I hate that. even during weekdays that are not over crowded they keep you waiting for at least 10 minutes unless you only come here for lunch.
Rosita's Place=I drive by Rosita's all the time-- and have never stopeed to go in... until 2 days ago and I am so glad I did.  It looks really tiny from McDowell but actually it is a pretty decent size.  I ordered the good ol standby: beef taco and cheese enchilada and rice.  I was very pleased with my meal.  It was affordable and tasty.  I will go back again.  The only drawback is the pond inside-- things like that skeeve me out. Service was normal, food came quickly (like most Mexican food places) and the chips were good- warm when delivered and the salsa was great!Location, location, location...  Yes, the type of service you receive at Rosita's all depends upon where you sit.  My experience:  4 visits sitting in the bar = great service.  1 visit sitting in the dining room = painfully slow service.  So, the bar is definitely the way to go, and not just because it offers closer access to the margaritas.  ;)Now that we have that out of the way, let me tell you about the three main reasons I love Rosita's:Hot, salty tortilla chips with spicy salsa - the perfect starter that sets up the appetite perfectly for...Powerful and potent margaritas - the super nice female bartender is not skimpy on the tequila in these!And, best of all, the most wonderful carne asada burro I have ever experienced.  This is not your average burro with a bit of meat and lots of 'filler' - rice, etc.  No, this is an enormous tortilla packed with meat, meat and more meat!  If you get it enchilada-style like I do, it will be topped with a delightfully messy mix of cheese and red sauce.  Bite after bite of goodness!So, clear your afternoon (those margaritas pack a kick!), grab a friend or two and get going!Can I tell you how much I love this place! I am going to!!   The absolute best Mexican food in the Valley. I love the Chicken soup here. Nothing is better.I was sick with a respiratory thing and this Chicken Soup was my saving soul food.I stopped in to get it to go about 5 times during my illness. I drove 22 miles round trip and worth every step.My experience here with the food has been above and beyond our expectations every time. The food is fresh, and delicious. The Chicken soup is heavenly and if you do not feel well. It is all you need.The chips and salsa and fresh and wonderful!Cheese enchiladas, Chicken tacos(hard shell), and the Beef tacos,my favorites on all of these. It is family owned, which might be another reason it is so good. They really care about the food,how it tastes, if it is hot, and fresh.It is very clean here, as well as the restrooms. You must park in the back ,that can be a little tricky if you have a large vehicle. Just go slow. One way in , and one way out. If I could give them 10 stars I would.
Ruths Chris Steak House=We dined here on Father's Day. Surprisingly, a lot of others were also treating the "Dad" in their life to a legendary steak. I had requested a romantic booth not knowing that they didn't have such a thing. But we did get a small table stuck in the corner. While you don't seem to get a lot of privacy, you do get good service and a pretty decent meal. We started with a with a Crabtini to share. It's lump crab meat tossed in vinaigrette and served with Creole remoulade sauce in a chilled martini glass. Very yummy! As for our steaks, they were amazing. I had a filet mignon. It was very flavorable and cooked to perfection. This is one of the best steaks that I have ever had. For our sides, we shared a one pound baked potato and asparagus with hollandise. For dessert, we shared a crème brûlée with fresh berries. Very delicious. Definitely a very nice special occasion restaurant.
Zoes Kitchen=I SOOOO wanted to love this place as it is cute as a bug's ear. Not that I'm saying there's bug's here,  I just think it's a lovely, modern clean space, with lots of light. My friend was craving the Greek pita. "OMG...it's soooo good, you have to go get us some." So, I get our to go pitas (chicken, lettuce, feta and tomato), certainly not inventive, yet it sounded like it would hit the spot. "OMG....the side pasta is sooooo good, you have to get that." Fine. Two Greek pitas both with pasta sides to go. Oh, and the chocolate cake. He said to get the chocolate sheet cake. Well, let me just say kiddies, the pita was dry, dry, dry. Sauceless and dry. Did I say it was dry. Chicken was dry. Pita was dry. It totally fell apart. And then so did I. Dry. Dry I say. Pasta side was actually quite good, all 2 oz. of it. BUT THE CAKE...OH MARY....THE CAKE! Truly a slice of chocolate heaven. I will go back and try some other items. Staff was friendly. I liked the space. Cake was, cheap, like a penny or something.From the street, my husband and I thought Zoe's Kitchen would be like Panera - that is, we thought it would serve fast, flavorful, and good-quality lunch fare. None of these adjectives turned out to be an accurate descriptor. In fact, the food at Zoe's kitchen took 30 minutes to come out and was disgustingly bland and in a few cases, quite gross. We stopped in for lunch last week. The place was packed, but the line to order moved quickly, so we incorrectly assumed that we would also get our food quickly. More on that in a second. In terms of the menu, we were shocked at how uninteresting the menu options seemed. Even though the menu was decently sized and we are open to lots of different types of food and flavors, we found ourselves completely unable to choose and not drawn to any individual option. Even though I'm not a vegetarian, I prefer lunch sandwiches with no meat, so I was also quite irritated that the only vegetarian sandwiches were the grilled cheese and grilled feta. This is 2008, and the non-meat options at a lunch spot should be more imaginative than cheese slapped on some bread. In the end, I still ended up ordering the grilled cheese (nothing else sounded good!) and my husband selected the Greek Chicken Marinara. We sat down at the table, displayed our number card, and just waited. And waited. And waited. After literally waiting for 25 minutes, I checked in with the assistant manager who was manning the pick-up counter. She went into the kitchen, checked on our order, and said it would be just a "few more minutes." She even had a server bring us two slices of chocolate cake as some sort of  token of their sympathy, but it was super-dry and totally gross. Thanks, but no thanks. I'm just glad we didn't pay $2 for each slice!It wasn't until 10 minutes later when I lost my patience and told the same server that we wanted our food immediately that we finally received it. We have a higher-than-average awareness of the difficulties of working in food service, but we found it un-acceptable that a non-full-service restaurant would take 35+ minutes to bring us two sandwiches. If they can't handle the catering, to-go, and eat-in order volume, they should hire more staff members. As if the slow service wasn't painful enough, my grilled cheese was completed charred (literally burned and black). After one bit of the accompanying slaw, which was soaked in mayonnaise and soggy, I  immediately walked back to the assistant manager, handed her the plate, and asked her to refund me for my plate. To her credit, she complied, but the wait had already been so egregious that I wasn't about to just write the long wait and gross food off and decide to return. My husband's Greek Marinara was not as terrible but was still bland and completely un-memorable. The bread was a plain roll, the chicken breast strips were formed and tasted totally processed, and the "Greek" marinara tasted like Prego. The only tasty part of his meal was the side of bagged chips!I guarantee you that we won't be back to Zoe's Kitchen. We are huge fans of fast, casual, and fresh lunch food, but we found the food at Zoe's to be anything but.I went here despite Yelpers telling me not to bother.  What did I get?  An overpriced, bland sandwich, confusion at the menu, and feeling awkward in the location.  It's an uppity cafeteria that makes you want to believe that their food is good for you, but it's not. Don't make the same mistake I did!
Tip Top Tavern=Man, Madison is getting so many great new places that it is hard for me to keep track! The Tip Top Tavern is one of those spots I always drove by and thought "Man, what a dive. I bet It's great", but never got around to visiting. So, when I found out they had opened back up with a new owner, a food menu, and a new look I decided I had better get over there. Seriously, folks - what a great little place. After a bit of a rough start where-in I ordered a beer that I couldn't even look at because it was so awful  (the Dogfish Head T'weason Ale - what a disaster of a beer. They were super cool and replaced it with their house old-fashioned, which was one of the best takes on the cocktail I have ever had) the meal went really smooth - especially considering how crazy busy it was.Between the three of us we ordered 2 burgers, cheese curds, and the fish fry special. The burger was delicious, moist, and cooked extremely well. The coleslaw was tasty, but had way too much vinegar. The fries were crispy and free of excess oil which was nice. Apparently the fish was delicious as well. Finally - the curds. Oh man, the curds! They were seriously (tip) top-notch. Lightly breaded, crispy, and gooey with some nice tasting ranch on the side. These are the closest to perfection I have ever had. Hopefully it wasn't a fluke!Beyond the food and drink, it really was a nice space. The lighting was great, the decorations were were fun, and it just felt like a cozy place that I would love to hang out at on a Wednesday night to grab a burger and a beer.I feel like all I have done lately is write about how awesome the spots I go to are, but hopefully that says more about how great Madison is than it does about my (potentially) overly-optimistic ratings.Time for an update, as it's been 6 months since my initial review, and I've revisited at least 15 times since then.+ The atmosphere can't be beat. Love the space.- Still quite noisy; certain voices (and annoying laughs) seem to really carry here+ The staff is excellent; honest, helpful, friendly, courteous - truly professional+ Beer list remains nearly identical to what it was 6 months ago, and that's OK by me+ Several taps on nitrogen - yummmmmmm+ Now has outdoor patio behind the bar+ The food is superb+ Fried pickles - get them. (oh, and you're welcome)+ Sandwiches - all are outstanding+ Fish fry is very, very solid+ Onsite ATM with reasonable service fee- Cash onlyRemains one of my very favorite places to visit.
Desert Jade="2 stars for disappointing food, one star for great service."Had I read Iain B's review prior to my dinner at Desert Jade the other night, I could've saved us $46.  Instead, my husband and future yelper sister Alexa M and I headed down Indian School road in search for some decent Chinese food.  We were all pretty hungry and it was my bright idea to try a new place.  We passed by Shanghai Chinese and actually pulled into the parking lot of another restaurant (maybe China Village?) but decided since the parking lot was close to empty, that was not a good sign.  So, somehow we ended up at Desert Jade.Ivan was our server and he was fantastic.  I just wish I could say the same about the food... Unfortunately, the egg drop soup, Kung Pao Vegetables, Spicy Chicken, and Beef and Asparagus dishes were nothing to write home about... all were mediocre.Next time, I'll go to one of our regular spots instead... or at the very least, I'll check the Yelp reviews before wasting time and money.  You live and learn... they cannot all compete with Tottie's or Jade Palace!Sadly, I have not been impressed with the Chinese food offered here in Phoenix. I had high hopes for Desert Jade and was hoping the food had improved from Gabi's 3-star review back in 2009, but I was not impressed and it seems that the reviews range widely here. The three food items we tried tasted fresh, but were seriously lacking in flavor. The Wor Won Ton Soup came with a generous serving of shrimp, pork, and beef pieces and vegetables, but the wontons were dense balls of dough that, as another reviewer mentioned, tasted more like gnocchi rather than meat-filled wontons. The Beef with Broccoli came with the thinest sauce I've ever had that had the flavor and consistency of beef broth. The beef was a tad overcooked and the broccoli was limp from being overcooked. The Chicken Chow Mein was the biggest disappointment as I was looking forward to the big, fat soft noodles that I have enjoyed and every other Chinese restaurant I've ever dined!! The lady on the phone said "Pan fried?" when I ordered, which I guess I was supposed to know meant, "Be prepared for thin, vermicelli-type noodles." Again, no real flavor to the chow mein dish, though the chicken was tender. On the plus side, the service was friendly and the food was ready quickly. I just wish the food was up to par with the service.
Niccoli's Italian Grocery & Deli=Roland hit the nail on the head here.... BREAD.  Bread is the most import part of Italian Sandwiches.  Niccoli's has it to perfection.  Everything about Niccoli's reminds me of my Italian neighborhood in Toronto where speaking in English was never needed at the local market, doctors, bakeries, service shops, or church.  It was little Italy.  Niccoli's has some of the best tasting food in town and it is locally onwed-- which is very nice.  PLUS, it's next to Burland Jewelry.... so pick up a Mortadella Sandwich AND some diamond studded earrings all  in one stop = HEAVEN ;o)As you walk into this friendly little Deli Packed to the ceiling with what you can expect to find in any establishment that calls itself an Italian style Deli in the heart of Manhattan. . . Only in the north part of Phoenix. The owner and his wife have been bringing this authentic NY experience to AZ for around 35 years. All the Cheeses! The LASAGNA ! The Garlic bread!I was making a "HAVE TO" trip to Trader Joe's on Saturday and pulled out my yelp app to see if I had anything worthy of lunch bookmarked in the neighborhood.  I did not, so I then searched and filtered based on highest reviewed.  Niccoli's came up, and it was settled.The parking lot, for the most part, was empty... but that didn't deter me from going in.  The smell that hit me upon entering reassured me that I had made the right choice.  Since I'm rarely in that neck of the woods, I ordered a meatball sub and an antipasto salad - knowing full well I would not be able to eat both in one sitting.  While waiting, I struck up a conversation with the female owner, who proceeded to tell me a story about a photo on the wall I had noticed of her and her husband, over 50 years ago, on the night of their wedding night.Just the fact that she took a few minutes to tell me about their lives that long ago while I waited for my food was worthy of at least four of these stars.  Then, as I was seated in the dining room next door, listening to Sinatra's greatest hits, the food came and it was out of this world.  Easily one of the best meatball subs I've ever consumed - the bread had the perfect chew - and wasn't soggy from the delicious fresh marinara.The salad had banana peppers, delicious olives, provolone, three different meats (salami, mortadella and pepperoni) and quite possibly the best Italian dressing to cover it in.  There were not many others who came to eat - but plenty were in and out for various Italian needs.  Their store is small, but appeared to have anything you might need for an authentic Italian meal.  Check this place out, whether you go for ingredients to make your own meal or want to try something they make fresh it's totally worth your time. If they're not that busy, ask about the beautiful picture on the wall and you're sure to hear a great story about Joe & Peppy's wonderful life.I have a serious crush on Niccoli's Deli and even though I don't live in the area, I will be sure to find my way to this little mom and pop shop as often as I can! I stumbled across this deli after reading all the raving Yelp reviews and having some time to spare before an event. I am so happy I had time to spare because it helped me discover one of my favorite delis! This Italian Market reminds me of someplace you'd find in a big city, but instead it's situated in a strip mall along 16th street. Upon entering, you're immediately welcomed by fresh meats in the coolers, fresh bread behind the counter, homemade raviolis waiting in the refrigerators and several rows of Italian imported products waiting for your kitchen adventures. I spent some time exploring each rack filled with exotic olive oils, fresh pastas, olive spreads, canned tomatoes and every other Italian product imaginable. First the owner welcomed me and led me to a reasonably priced yet delicious bottle of olive oil. This is after I accidentally picked up the $70 bottle of olive oil! Whoops. After filling my arms with products to make a homemade Italian meal, I then made my way to the counter and my mouth started watering as I read about all the sandwiches and menu items they offer. Unfortunately I was going to an event, otherwise I would have purchased a sandwich. However, I did purchase two rolls to make a sandwich later! During check-out, I began chatting with the owner's lovely wife who started giving me kitchen tips. She even gave me a recipe for a summer pasta sauce! She took the time to carefully explain the recipe to me and then wrote it down. I feel like I received a special gift! I've already tried the meal at home and it was just as amazing as she promised it would be!If you're in the area and want some delicious Italian products, or you simply want a tasty sandwich, this is your spot!
Sweet Tomatoes=While I generally avoid any place with a sneeze gaurd, Rickie and I had a hankering for salad bar. And while we were smart and got our See's Candies first in case the salad bar experience didn't pan out, we were ready for 93 toppings to pick from. Upon entering I was impressed by the cleanliness of Sweet Tomatoes. Every station was stocked and ready for the pilling. I'm NOT here for a healthy salad. I want the egg, bacon, cheese extravaganza. I want ranch AND blue cheese. I want a difibulator!!!! All fresh. All pretty darn yummy. We had a Canadian Cheese Ham soup. Yowza! Good, gooey, salty...really, it was more like a dip. But we polished off that cup. They have pastas, desserts, focaccia, food, food, food. All in all my low expectations were exceeded by a good foodie experience!Being on a No Meat Diet makes you think outside the box sometimes when your accustomed to being an omnivore.....so, when we were looking around for a place to grab some lunch a friend suggested we stop by Sweet Tomatoes.  It has been over 10 yrs since I've been to one, so I thought why not.We arrived just before the lunch rush at 11:30 am.  There was a short line, but nothing crazy.  I piled a bunch of Salad and Pasta Salad on my plate and then made the rounds over to the Bread section.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/NZAxQxXH0YkSzPOKd_Nv-w?select=jRysLhaB-0yg5Wa2EYYQswhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/NZAxQxXH0YkSzPOKd_Nv-w?select=L3xqRAzbnoT7e2khkOUW6wThe food was very good, tasty and satisfying.  I went back to grab a small bowl of Mac n Cheese too, which was ok.I had a coupon for 2 for $9.99, so it was a great deal.  Overall, the meal was perfect and I left full.Return Factor - 90%
Fatburger=It's no secret....I love Pizza & Burgers.  Fatburger is one of my favorite Burger joints.  When I found this location, I was ecstatic.  I ordered a Fatburger w/Cheese combo w/Skinny Fries.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/xWMZJd0_Azfcx3VWJCxNng?select=4_UEKgyVSElmZoYUkqg2XAhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/xWMZJd0_Azfcx3VWJCxNng?select=CvyTY9R0VhkQfybbqfnoPgThe Burger was fresh & tasty as usual....yum!  If you've never been to Fatburger before, be prepared to wait for your food....it always takes a while for them to make your Burger, because they make it fresh, to order.  It's worth the wait though.Return Factor - 91%
Cheese 'n Stuff=My favorite favorite favorite place. Possibly ever. When I was in highschool my loitering teenybopper friends and I used to get kicked out of here on a regular basis, but I don't hold that against them. We were idiots.cNstuff has been around forever and is owned by the nicest family on the planet. The minute I walk in there the smell of cheese (or is it sandwiches?) makes me instantly hungry. And there is lots of cheese. The sandwich menu is extensive and I always have the hardest time deciding what to order. It seems like there is a new sandwich added everyday. Do I want the Doe Boy or just a plain ol' Tuna? Russian dressing or mustard? Sub roll or wheat? For extra you can get a side of chips, potato or macaroni salad (which is a little too sweet for me). There is also a plethora of little extra snacks to fill up on, candy bars, twinkies you name it. Last time in there, there was noticeably less Swedish products on the shelves which was a little sad. Maybe they weren't selling very well? They were always enjoyable to look at. Anyway, please stop in to this delightful little sandwich shop, you won't be disappointed.Edited to add: German products, not Swedish. They were Umlaut-laden names so I got confused.Dough boy...dough boy...dough boy...Cheese n stuff may have a large menu with something for nearly everyone but I just can't walk in there and not order my Dough Boy. Top it off with macaroni salad and an iced tea and I'm all set.On top of being mildly obsessed with that amazing sandwich, there's much to love in their little space. The friendly family that runs the place is always smiling and happy to see you and welcome all guests... high schoolers on their skateboards, businessmen in their Mercedes, white collar guys in their beat-up pickups...they all are mingling in that little deli. I've yet to go there, and I've been probably 20 times, and not have the owners know at least one guest by name when they walk in.This was orignally a meat and cheese shop back in the day, hence the name, and they still have some deli products to pick up if you feel like skipping Safeway's. It's an old-school, quiet place. It's always nice to dine-in and enjoy the quiet atmosphere and feel like you're not in the big city for a short time. It may be hard to spot the store in that little strip mall, so just look for the Dairy Queen...it's right next to it.There is a lot of hype for this pretty average sandwich joint. My co-workers and I heard about this place through a listing of 20 great American Sandwich shops and it apparently even had an Oprah mention. After seeing these glowing reviews here as well I was pretty much certain that I would be let down in some way, but its hard to even imagine the reason for the hype this place achieved.It is an extremely tiny shop stuck at the end of the strip mall with central music. It's so tiny I've parked in front of it before and haven't even noticed it. The inside looks to have been renovated circa 1982 with faux wood paneling and shelving, and vintage boar's head advertisements that have been left to rot. The menu spread out across the entire wall on a confusing mix of chalk boards and computer print outs. The eating space is an extremely claustrophobic setup of folding tables and chairs stuck between the deli counter and the half-assed market shelves that sported international items that were mostly covered with a thick layer of dust.The actual sandwiches, solid quality deli stuff using primarily boar's head meats and cheeses. That's it? Why would you fall in love with this place? I went with five other guys who ordered a mix of their signature sandwiches (Doughboy, Bizmark, Manhattan), and all agreed you can get a similar sandwich at grocery stores and preferred even the likes of Sack's to this place. There is just nothing inventive about the sandwiches or anything that stands out here other then the friendly Mom and Pop ownership and sweet vintage sign.
Stockyards Restaurant=This is an easy review for me... because the restaurant was accomodating, (we two business travelers arrived around 630p unannounced), the service was friendly and efficient, the interior is simple western motif, and our entire experience was both comfortable and delicious.We were staying at the Hilton Airport Hotel on the South side of the airport. When we quickly decided that a "petite filet and a baked potato" sounded like a winner, we hit the Verizon GPS. We only saw the name come up on our Verizon GPS, and we followed the instructions from the hotel, around the West side of the airport, and then East on Washington to the restaurant. I joked that if it had turned out to be like a Black Angus, or an Outback, I'd still be OK with making that our destination. We didn't want to go wandering all over Phoenix looking for a steakhouse.It's a historical landmark building, and we saw both business people and locals doing dinner. I really think it's what many of you guys call "a hidden gem." I say that because the location is in a sorta' bleak, industrial portion of Washington, just North of the airport. So don't go looking for a modern strip mall of fooderies. To me, the place looks more like the corporate offices for a rock quarry. But once you go past the copper clad double entry doors..... you'll know you're at a down home, upscale steakery!So, my simple recommendation is this... if you're in town like I am on business, this is a great place to take anyone! For the most part, steaks run around $30 to $45, depending on cut and size, and unless someone's cut out your tongue, I'm pretty sure you'll enjoy, or probably love your food! With a great bar and wine inventory, you'll probably float around $50 per person with one drink. Add app's and, well, the tab climbs a bit. And by the way, regarding your steaks... if you say "rare", then it's rare. And if you say "pink in the middle"..... that's what you'll get! Again; well worth what we paid.While I appreciate a good steak occasionally, I don't appreciate $9 baked potatoes.  I'm sorry, but if I'm paying $40 for a piece of meat, is it too much to ask to throw in the potato? This quirk has eliminated a growing number of steakhouses from my list of dining options.  I'm happy to report that Stockyards agrees with me.Although the area leaves a lot to be desired, I love that this restaurant is rich in Arizona history.  I love the building (check out the bar) and it's Old West charm.  And I love that it's still here after decades of change in the Valley.  The restaurant is quite large with several rooms.  Nice enough to dress up a little, but still comfortable enough for casual attire.  That's "casual," not pajama bottoms and bed head.  This isn't Safeway.My dining companion and I shared the Chateaubriand for Two (in other words, me and the dude I married ate a big tenderloin).  The steak was really good and perfectly tender.  It was served with the expected Bearnaise (which I didn't care for) and a house steak sauce which was better.  Also included were mashed potatoes, whiskey sweet potato mash, mushrooms, and "seasonal" vegetables, in addition to the salad, corn muffins, and biscuits served at the beginning.  A lot of food for $80!  The mashed potatoes were average (but they weren't $9), and the vegetables were a disappointment, consisting of nothing but julienned carrots and some broccoli.  The sweet potato mash was very tasty, however.  Did you know it's possible to eat sweet potatoes without marshmallows?  Crazy, I know.While I thought some of the food was closer to 3 stars, I can't help but bump it up to 4 given the overall experience.At the recommendation of a friend, I met a client here for lunch.  My client was arriving from out of town and this joint is very conveniently located near the airport.  I guess once upon a time, it was an actual stockyard.  Now, it's an old school restaurant that has a lot of character.After browsing the menu, I opted for a BBQ Pulled Pork Sandwich & Fries, $10.  To wash it down, I ordered Iced Tea.The Pork Sandwich was awesome, very tasty and a large portion.  You will get full.  The Fries were tasty as well.My client was impressed with the restaurant and put it on his "best place near the airport to have a lunch meeting" list....+++The service was great and we were able to have a good lunch meeting that left us both satisfied.Return Factor - 100%A flawless experience at this icon of old Phoenix, and a better value than most other premium steak places I've visited.In more cases than I can recall, a place with the history and legacy of the Stockyards would have fallen into complacency long ago, milking the same group of dedicated customers and giving less value to anyone who's not a regular. However, our visit was great from the moment I made the reservation. The menu is very traditional, and they've even played the retro angle by bringing back a prix fixe option that includes Steak Diane. We opted for the Chateaubriand for Two, and it was some delicious melt-in-your-mouth beef. No complaints on the service, either. As far as attire goes: It's a fancy restaurant in some ways, but remember that it's in Phoenix, and that it was originally located next to one of the largest feedlots West of the Mississippi. You won't look out of place in jeans and a polo.I wanted to like this place but the service we experienced here was awful and soured everything. It didn't start off bad, we made reservations and the hostess was friendly. She seated us promptly in a nice comfy booth and we received a breadbasket with crudités to munch on. When our waiter came to take our orders, we informed him we'd be ordering off the Restaurant Week menu and he made this face of dismay and haughty superiority. Apparently Restaurant Week offended our waiter? This is where it went downhill as from here on out, our waiter had an attitude. As a first course, we had the option of salad or soup. We asked if we could have Caesar dressing on our salad and at first the waiter looked upset that we'd make such a request and looked ready to refuse but relented and said yes. However we found out later that this was an additional charge that he did not mention to us. (Extra $10, really?) The salad was average, nothing to write home about. For our second course, both of us ordered the prime rib with creamed horseradish, which was disappointing. (Again, when placing our order, the waiter seemed really upset - like we were asking him to butcher the cow and then cook us the meal himself.) The prime rib was average thickness, about half an inch and a rather large portion, but the flavor was lackluster. Even the horseradish, which my husband loves, didn't help. For dessert, I ordered the chocolate mousse and my husband ordered the cheesecake. I wasn't very impressed with the mousse as it had a citrusy flavor - which was not mentioned on the menu and ruined it for me. (I like my mousse decadent - a deep chocolate flavor. This wasn't.) The cheesecake was good, but my husband would eat any cheesecake.Then, we waited. And we waited. The waiter had disappeared on us! We waited for a good 20 minutes before we saw him anywhere near our table. My husband had to flag him down and request our bill. Again, the waiter looked like we were asking him to chop down a tree, make both the paper and ink, and then write our receipt in calligraphy. After a few minutes, he came back with our bill and promptly disappeared again. We were shocked to see the extra fee for our salads, as it wasn't explained to us (we would have been fine if it was expressed to us) but unfortunately we couldn't find our waiter. Obviously we couldn't use our credit card (no waiter to process the card) and we had enough cash to pay for the meal plus tip. This is the first time we ever did not want to leave a tip but lucky for this waiter we felt so unwanted that we just dropped our cash and left.We won't be back.This is my go to steakhouse. Been here many of times and always enjoy my time here. This time we came here with a large group. They basically have a large main dining area, a smaller back group which is quieter, and the bar area. Not too many people hang out in the bar area so it's pretty quiet there. Today we got all the tables in the bar area so it was almost like a semi private party. They start you off with their jalapeño muffins and raw vegetable tray. Everything is so good but I always have to watch myself cause I don't want to fill my self up. Next came their seafood chowder. One of my favorites. It is so good. All I remember is the salmon in there but I know other seafood is in there. I ordered the 16oz ribeye with a baked potato. The ribeye was cooked perfect. Juicy. Not too much fat and just melt in your mouth meat. I'm an fan as you can tell. My wife tried the buffalo meatloaf and she really loved it. I stole a bite and it was so tender and smooth. Really liked it with that gravy. She had sweet potato mash and grilled vegetables. The veggies where cooked perfect and tender. It's a really good dish. To top it off I had the pecan pie. It's was good but I had better. Taking nothing away from this pie. It was really good and not to sweet with a nice flaky crust. Our service was great. Got our drink orders and always filled out glasses without being asked. We had one person at our table who had there steak cooked a little too much for their liking and they made no fuss about it and brought her another one while continuing to apologize to her. So I've been here and had multiple ribeye, prime rib, and baby back ribs and it's all really good. The reason I like this place is they give you so much for your money. If you go to those other steakhouse you got to pay for all your sides and appetizer. Here you get a soup or salad and a potato side. Well worth the money. Of course, I'll be back.
Fiori's Pizzaria=This is a 5 star pizza place period. There is no better pizza in the world. I live in California and when I'm in Pittsburgh I always stop here. I recommend the cheese pizza. Fiori's uses the best and freshest ingredients. Their cheese pizza is very flavorful. Adding anything else to the pizza takes away from the crust, sauce and cheese. Caution let the pie cool down a bit. It comes out burning hot. The subs are good here too.They've get a line out the door. They must be doing something right.
The Inn on Negley=Without a doubt one of the nicest places I have ever had the pleasure of laying my head......having wine and cheese.......or breakfasting.The Inn on Negley is gorgeously appointed.  The individual rooms, all named for varieties of apple, are spectacular.  We were in the lovely Northern Spy.  The bed was wonderfully comfortable, the linens unbelievably soft and luxurious.  L'Occitane bath products smelled divine.  The Shadyside neighborhood outside of downtown is quiet but still conveniently located to all the Pittsburgh doings.Breakfast each morning, cooked by the hospitable Chef Jackie, is pure pleasure.  Each night on your pillow a menu card appears; check off what you'd like in the morning, what time you'll be eating, and drop it off in the dining room.  The next day, Jackie is ready and waiting with a fresh fruit plate, the pastry of the day, and fantastically strong and flavorful coffee.  Omelets and fritattas are made with local produce and eggs.  Irish oatmeal is served with milk from a nearby creamery.  Toast bread changes daily but is always whole-grain and delicious.  Breakfast meats are lean and filling.  Afternoons, iced tea and cookies are set out, and in the evenings wine and cheese served.  Enjoy them in a rocker on the front porch, relaxing on the back deck retreat, or in the privacy of your room.  Staff is not only eminently professional, but warm and gracious.  Heidi at the front desk was beyond helpful in making suggestions for what to do in the city or where to eat (I will be forever indebted to her for recommending what was probably our best meal of the trip at Soba).  If you ever find yourself in Pittsburgh, lodgings can't get much better than the Inn on Negley.That's probably sufficient gushing.Absolutely adorable!  On my quest to be a refined English lady I've been on a hunt for the cities best high tea service.  Probably not the most popular past time, but you can't knock it until you've tried it!  And... You MUST try this place!This is a proper setting for such an event, you almost feel like you need white gloves and a parasol!  And surprise, the Inn is actually an Inn!  Apparently it dates back to the olden days of yore (late 1800's) and is one of those old Shadyside mansions that was converted into an Inn at some point.  But if you have relatives who want something more unique in the heart of a vibrant Burgh neighborhood, I'd suggest here!Let's get to the tea service though!  It's served from noon to four daily, which is nice for a "ladies who lunch afternoon" or a Saturday or Sunday outing for mom.  It's in a parlor, which is small but charming.  There's also an outdoor patio that would be nice if it's not too hot out (drinking hot tea in 80 degrees isn't too appealing).  There's a full High Tea Service for $20 per person, which seems a little steep, but for tea service isn't too bad.  There's also other combo's for around $12, but I'd say go big or go home!The tea menu is VERY large and there were tons of choices. They give you the main choices between black, green and herbal, but you can also blend them together too.  I chose the caramel vanilla, which I guess is being taken off the menu sadly.  It was delish though... so maybe they'll bring it back at some point.  There were honestly a lot of different ones I would have been more than happy with too!The one thing I think is very cool and very different is that they offer you a different tea selections with the different tiers of food.  I've never heard of them doing that before.  Usually you get one tea choice and that's it.  I love that you can pair the foods together with different teas for no up-charge.  Very unique and a definite perk of coming here.  I've been to several High Tea Services and this one would definitely be on the light side.  The portions were small, but surprisingly filled me up for the entire afternoon until a later dinner.  I mean, it's tea service, not a five course meal!  There was a chicken and egg salad sandwich and a mushroom and cream cheese on a crisp baguette.  The winner was absolutely the mushroom and cream cheese choice.  It was amazing and I definitely could have eaten ten of those!  There were two scone choices of blueberry/peach and lemon/lemon ginger.  Those were actually surprisingly tiny.  I thought they were both moist and fresh, but I would have loved them to be a bit bigger because they were so good and I love to slather clotted cream on them!   Oh, and there was also fresh fruit.  Which is great and all, but more scone please!The last tier was the desserts.  Forgive me for not being accurate enough, but there was a delicious chocolate piece, cheesecake with lemon curd and blueberries.  Loved the chocolate, but I like my cheesecake plain.  While it was good it wasn't life changing.  BUT, the coconut macaroon was honestly thee best macaroon I had EVER had.  Again, ten of those in my possession would have been scarfed down in like 5 seconds.  I would buy a batch of those if I could!  Seriously, can I??I can't wait to bring my mom here, total mom place fo sho!  But I also love it for myself too!  Or for a bridal shower... If I could do another one (since I'm married I don't think that's proper).  But it's a great place, that's what I'm trying to say and I'll for sure be back to get my proper English lady on!
Panda Express=Me 10 years ago: Panda Express, mmm good, and they give you lots!Me today: Panda Express is crap. It's got to be the most average, bland, over-Americanized "Asian" food around.I challenge you to find more average/below average food chain anywhere in the state.
Emperor Chinese Restaurant=While I hate nailing a place that has so few reviews, I'm afraid I have to give this place one star.  Some of you might say, "well, what did you expect from a strip mall Chinese joint?"  Well, some of the best Chinese food on the West Coast is in a strip mall or even in a bad part of town.  Sadly, this restaurant is not only shabby inside and out, but their food is just as shabby.Their sauces taste bottled with a one-size fits all sort of technique:  pile on thick, gunky brown sauce on everything and call it Chinese.  Plates that are old and worn.  Dirty glasses.  Shelves that appeared thick with dust.  A faded "Best of Charlotte" frame on the wall that dates back to many years ago. It's sad to see a small business that just doesn't get it.  The food here falls short of the worst  Chinese food in a mall food court. That says it all.I don't think it was that bad.  I think some yelp reviewers over exaggerates their reviews and make it worst than it is. My colleague and I ate here for lunch because she recommended it. I didn't feel like eating Chinese food, but decided what the heck. I'll try this hole in the wall Chinese joint since they offer vegetarian options.I ordered the lunch special "Sa Cha Tofu" and a sweet tea. The total? $6.00. Straight up cheap! My dish was hot! I didn't know what Sa Cha Tofu was, but I was feeling adventurous, so I ordered it. It was good vegetarian dish that came with a complimentary egg roll. "Sa Cha Tofu" is basically a stir fry with Siracha. It's hella hot!  I didn't care for the egg roll though. I prefer the Philippine lumpia version 'cause the wrapper is thinner. They have a variety of vegetarian dishes here that range from $4.75 to $7.75. This is a great option if you are on a budget. They also deliver which is nice. I usually stay at uptown Crowne Plaza, so the next time I come to Charlotte I will order something here for delivery.
Soba=Dude.  Pittsburgh.  Who knew you had such a refined and sexy dining scene???Well, your good citizens, that's who.  Which is how husband and I were referred to Point Brugge, Salt of the Earth, and lastly Soba Lounge, thanks to the brilliant hostess at our B&B who told us Soba was her favorite spot within walking distance.  I don't usually dine without Yelping these days, but I am *so* glad we recklessly heeded her advice.  Our meal at Soba was one of the finest, most delicious, and wholly satisfying that I can recall (joining Salt of the Earth, no less, in that prestigious category...).The subtle lighting and modern décor of the joint is coolly lovely, setting the mood right away for a relaxed dining experience.  Attentive, professional service is provided by servers who explain that most of the produce used in Soba's dishes is locally sourced and are happy to make recommendations.  Husband and I started out with an Asparagus Maki Roll appetizer, with tempura asparagus, tamago, roasted local shiitakes, scallion, and a spicy lemon ponzu.  The soft, sticky rice didn't overwhelm the crunchy asparagus, earthy 'shroom, and slightly-sweet tamago; the ponzu dip was a pleasantly sour foil.  We also had an order of Thai-inspired Blue Bay Mussels with crispy soba and aioli, which were *fab-u-lous.*  I eat a lot of mussels, but these were some of the most enjoyable I've ever had.For entrées, husband and I split the Soba Noodle Scallops -- which arrived at the table with root spinach, cuttlefish, wild mushroom, and fresh wasabi -- and the Seared Tuna -- with a sesame crust, cucumber-red-onion salad, kimchee, ginger fried rice, and peanuts.  Both dishes were out of this world.  Husband I had trouble cutting ourselves off at half and switching plates, but were both rewarded tenfold for doing so.  The scallops had a perfect sear, the soba was fat and chewy, the ponzu wasabi broth was soul-warming.  And the tuna was seared expertly, still gorgeously garnet and cool in the middle, complemented by a crunchy, nutty sesame crust and that flavorful rice.  I don't think either of us wanted that meal to end.  And all things considered, husband and I thought the bill at the end of the night was ridiculously reasonable.  Soba FTW.Pittsburgh, I have a crush on you.  Your perfectly-priced fine-dining scene makes me want to pull up stakes and move in with you.I've never been to Soba to eat a proper dinner. Only for drinks in their old bar. I remember it being tiny and pretty unremarkable. But now... wow! It's really a beautiful space. They must have replaced the lounge and the drink menu... because now it's memorable!We were sitting there enjoying the open air windows looking onto the street, as the slight summer breeze rolled in, trying to figure out if this was an unused space or a new building they bought. Either way, the expansion is incredible! I truly enjoyed sitting in the lounge sipping on some pretty phenomenal cocktails. I think sometimes I just assume Meat and Potatoes and Acacia are going to be the joints were I'm going to enjoy a stellar cocktail and that's it. But how narrow minded of me? I should be equal opportunity cocktail, right?! I loved the Docksider (silver rum, aperol, agave nectar, grapefruit bitters, lemon, basil). I'm super into any cocktail with grapefruit, because that equals refreshing to me, and less sweet. But what blew me away was the Rebellion (beet infused wigle whiskey, luxardo maraschino). I love beets, so if you don't, this may not be the drink for you... BUT I thought it had a light beet taste with just the right amount of whiskey. And those maraschino cherries. Geez. I could eat gallons of them!We also sampled some grub from the menu. The spicy noodles were very good, with just the right amount of spice to make my noose run (a sign of good spice). I could have used a touch more veggies, as the mushrooms were very good, but I find noodle dishes never have enough veggies in them. I thought the pork rolls were okay as well as the calamari, but really dug the yellowtail sashimi. Fresh and delicious. Like it should be! I want to try every single drink. So let's begin...Had the famous "Birthday Coupon" and decided to make it worth the free entree. This place has been on my list for a while, and I was finally able to convince my husband make the trip for date night. The only seating available without a reservation was at the bar, which is never a problem for us. We were two of the only three people there, and it was really quiet, so perfect!We were greeted by the bartender who was very knowledgeable and friendly. He provided us with drink menus and gave us an ample amount of time to decide. We started with the hamachi sashimi, which was a brilliant blend of pomegranate, pear, and avocado with amber jack tuna. A spicy little sauce was plated along with it, and the mix was really tasty. Beautiful presentation as well. My main course was the Thaikkal curry, which was a fun, educational dish for me. First, the eggplant was fire-grilled, which blended so well with the curry sauce. It was plated with bean sprouts and slices of fresh mango, which I had never thought to pair with a curry. The roti was fried, which I didn't prefer. My husband ordered the seafood hot pot. Quite a full portion of seafood with a side of rice, this vast array of shellfish went down quick. His comment was "It's Big Burrito salty."Really savory food and pleasant service in an atmosphere drowned in Massive Attack. That's Soba.
Canton Wong=Four stars with a caveat, DO NOT ACTUALLY GO TO THE RESTURAUNT,---ONLY ORDER BY PHONE!  Inside is way nasty, it's old, kinda dirty, with an old man sleeping in a chair in the next room, etc. etc.Food was very fresh, full of vegetables and the chicken and shrimp were both better than PF Changs, IMHO.  I'll order by phone next time and forget that I ever went inside that place.
Ritters Diner=I stopped into Ritter's for breakfast this past Sat. morning at 11am.  Despite living two blocks away and having driven by many times, I'd never dropped in until now.  Given that I needed an inexpensive and convenient place to meet someone who also lives nearby, I figured it was as good of an opportunity as any to try it out, so I suggested it and we met for Sat. breakfast.Fortunately, my friend arrived 15 min. before I did and was able to secure a table, since Ritter's gets quite crowded on Sat. mornings.  Also fortunately, the interior is quite large, which is necessary given its popularity at peak hours.  Once I was seated, our server promptly took our orders, which was appreciated.  However, it took almost half an hour for the kitchen to get them out, which seemed long, given the amount of time that my friend had already waited, and that I've received prompter order fulfillment at other diners, such as the Dor Stop.Once it finally emerged, the food itself was pretty standard quality diner food--nothing to write home about.  Given that it was Halloween morning, I ordered the pumpkin pancake special ($5.99) with a side of bacon ($2.50).  I could definitely detect pumpkin in the pancake batter, which was nice, but I've been spoiled by the Dor Stop's pumpkin pancakes (which are available year round, BTW), and these didn't hold a candle to them.  The bacon was also disappointingly chewy, to the point that I didn't even finish part of my last strip.  My friend ordered the chicken sandwich, which seemed of similar mediocre quality, though I didn't try it.Overall, Ritter's met my standards for diner food, but didn't exceed them, and failed to meet them in some respects (chewy bacon--argh!).  One thing Ritter's has going for it is that the prices are quite reasonable; however, come prepared as only cash is accepted.  I realize that a lot of their business comes from inebriated customers late at night, so if that describes your situation, it probably hits the spot.  If you're willing to travel and are looking for a good weekend morning breakfast, though, I recommend the Dor Stop in Dormont or Central Diner and Grill in Robinson, both of which illustrate that diner food can be better than mediocre--in fact, it can be great!
Go Go China=Have you ever had a day, where you just didn't want to get out of bed at all?  I mean not even to go to the bathroom?  Well, if you are anything like Mr. Dallas G, you may ask, what could implore you to stay in bed all day?  Well Mr. G, the company of a lovely woman was number one on my list on this particular Saturday.  At about 1:30 in the afternoon, we both started to get ravenous.  I had been having cravings for Chinese food since about 11 PM the previous night.  My lovely bed mate suggested Go Go China.  I had never eaten here before and am a little reluctant to branch out from my usual go to Chinese place.  Once the stunning sack-mate informed me that they deliver and I would not have to leave the bed, I was sold.  She even went downstairs and got the menu! Goddess material, right?  We perused the menu and made our decisions.  I had the task of calling in the order.  A man answered and it was barely discernible what language they were speaking.  After inquiring about placing an order for delivery I was told that they would call back in exactly 6 minutes.  I began to question this, but the other line had already gone dead.  So, we waited the 6 minutes and by golly the phone rang.  I ask to place the order, but am first bombarded with what seems like a CIA inquiry.  After passing the interrogation I am finally allowed to place the order.  Sesame Chicken lunch special for me, which included wonton soup and pork fried rice, and Chicken Lo Mein with chicken fried rice and a pork egg roll.  We also got a shrimp egg roll.  I was worried when they quoted a 45-60 minute wait for delivery.  So, when the food arrived in 20 minutes I was ecstatic.  The beautiful woman next to me went downstairs to retrieve the food and everything.  From atop Mount Olympus she must have come.The wonton soup was really good, the fried rice was really good,  the Sesame chicken was really good, and the egg roll was really good.  The ravishing Ms. M next to me said all of her food was really good too. Overall, the food was really good.  The best part, aside from being in a bed with a gorgeous woman, eating Chinese food, and not really worrying about anything, the total with delivery and tip was only $21!  To this half-breed Jew, that is the silver lining my friends.   If you find yourself stuck to your mattress and are in need of some sustenance, call Go Go China, wait 6 minutes for a call back and get it delivered.  They truly did.
Thai Basil=I don't understand the people who have caused the rating of this place to be so low.  I am not a Thai person, but I know delicious food when I put it in my mouth, and this place is great.First the atmosphere: This is a fairly small place with a warm, pleasant feeling.  It's usually not crowded, so it's not a bad place to go to have a little dinner conversation, and maybe get a little bit romantic.  Maybe move in close with your lover and get some kisses in before you order those spicy dishes.The food is great.  Fantastic flavor, good spice (I order 'medium' which is just enough to make me keep reaching for my drink), and reasonable sized portions.  A hungry person can go away fed but not bloated, and someone with a little appetite can have a little to take home!I pretty consistently order the Beef Drunken Noodles (without onion, because I am a lover and have to keep that fresh breath) which have incredible flavor, and are a dish which I haven't been able to find at a lot of other Thai restaurants.  I definitely recommend it, and if you don't like it then you probably don't know what good food tastes like!
Flavors of India=OK so maybe I'm just a simple Scandanavian man, with an easily pleasable palette. But judging by other yelp reviews, my first FOI experience stands alone. I get a kick out of most Thai/Indian/Asian strip mall restaurants. The decor is pretty tacky. So, I tend to get my chow to go. I had the friendliest, most helpful lady guide me through the menu. We picked out a vindaloo, a tandoori, 2 orders of naan, some veggie fritters and a tikka masala. Vindaloo 2 starsTandoori 3 starsMasala 5 starsFritters 0 stars ughhh Naan 5 starsKing Fisher Beer 10 stars...can I do that?Service 5 starsFalse ceiling with stains 1 starTo go boxes and packaging on full display behind bar 1 starDecor...Bollywood meets flea market meets storage roomWell, as they say in India, um, hmmm...I don't really know what they say in India. So, I settle for see you later yelpers!I used to be scared...I used to be petrified.  I was never one to branch out with my variety of cuisine, which meant that I never had Indian food before...until a couple of months ago when I was invited to a dinner party. And at Flavors of India...my Indian Food cherry was broken.I decided to review this place now...since I have experienced other restaurants since.  I tend to always come back to this location.  The place seems very clean, I love the Bollywood videos that they play, and I love the service.  And I think that they have the best buffet!  Now, I am really bad at names of the food that I order there (which is why I end up at the buffet...I may not know the names, but I know what I like looks like)See me there at lunch real soon :)I'm finding more and more great places to eat in the central Phoenix area and I can add this to the list,  thanks to fellow yelpers Rand H and Mike C who invited me to join them for lunch buffet here. Seating is ample, with booths available. Lighting is toned down to a comfortable level and the TV screen playing Bollywood dance videos had the sound turned down.  I enjoyed pretty much every item in the lunch buffet. The main dishes were really savory; I especially liked the onion and cauliflower pakora. The  heat level of the dishes that were spicy was just right for me. The two desserts offered - mango pudding and rice pudding - were superb and an excellent way to cap a great meal. Service was very efficient, and the cost of the buffet was 10 bucks, tax included - truly a great deal.Yesterday was my first time trying Indian food (don't judge meeeee!) and I'm now HOOKED! Anyone who hasn't tried Indian food, or is curious and wants to sample - go here. This review is based on the lunch buffet, which beats out Chinese buffets any day of the week. You have a selection of 9-10 choices, plus dessert. The neatest part is the variety of food switches every day, so you're never eating the same thing over and over. Yesterday's buffet consisted of chicken masala (chicken, spices, tomato sauce cooked), daal makhani (lentil soup), bhindi (bombbbb okra!), chicken curry... and a ton of other goodies (dessert was shahi kheer - basmati rice pudding with almond and pistachios). My only complaint was the bread, as it felt like it was covered in oil. However, for $11.99 and all you can eat - I don't really care.Side note: they play this channel on their TV that's an Indian version of MTV - so freaking entertaining.
The Downtown Deli=The Downtown Deli is my go to whenever I'm jonesing for loads of meat or a fat juicy dog. I've had every meat sandwich on the menu over the last 10 years and my favorite is the Skyscraper. Mounds of Corned Beef & Pastrami w/ melted Swiss, Dijon slathered on Marble Rye, with a side of French fries, a pickle wedge, and large Root Beer. I'm not a huge hot dog fan but I'll break down once in a while and go for the 1/4 lb all Beef Dog with Straw. It's a pretty darn good dog! The dogs go for around 3 bucks and the specialty sandwiches start at $8.25. But they are well worth it. Warning: This is not the place for people who are looking for a light meal or can't stomach a Motha of a sandwich. You will get dirty looks from waiting patrons and you'll throw the line cook off his game if you ask for a healthy alternative to the specialty sandwiches. Stick to the menu and you'll be just fine except for needing to take your belt out a notch; no harm in that.Ah excuse me? Am I the only one bothered by the way they make their omelette's here? I ordered breakfast here this morning and was mortified when I saw the cook about to place my omelette in the microwave to melt the cheese!  He was shocked when I told him to stop.I know Microwave foods has become an integral part of modern life, but you don't ruin an omelette by nuking it after you cook it in the grill. That's just weird.
Vincent's On Camelback=THE BEST OMELETTE I'VE EVER HAD!!!!Saturday Brunch Review.You can custom make your own omelette. My friend who is a regular ordered mine for me. Her concoction consisted of bacon, ham, cheese, sun dried tomatoes, fresh basil, and pesto.  Wow, it was hands-down the best omelette I've ever had.The price was reasonable at about $10.The next time I'm back visiting Phoenix, Vincent's On Camelback is on my list of places to re-visit..
Vincent Market Bistro=Welcome to Paris in the desert. Je t'aime Vincent's. Anything Vincent's does I love. Whether it's the 5 star dining in the front, the market bistro in the back or the Saturday morning marketplace outside. They really know how to frenchafy AZ. I've been to Vincent's Market Bistro several times and most recently, last night for a friend's birthday. The Market Bistro is the more intimate, kitchen style dining at Vincent's and actually my favorite way to dine there. I walked in and immediately felt like I'd entered a cozy and intimate restaurant in the heart of Paris. The food was cooking, the guests at the tables were laughing and having a great time and the waitstaff knew almost everyone by name. The authentic french decor helped the cause as well. When I hear the name Vincent's, I immediately think "oh yikes, here comes a pricey night," but the best part about it is that the market bistro keeps the evening at an incredibly reasonable price without losing the quality of food. Are you ready for this? I got the pre fix meal that began with a delectable crab cake on a salad with avocado garnish, followed by the lobster chimichanga and topped off with the chocolate tart which was really a chocolate souffle. How much? $20. Only $20 my friends! It was delicious. With each savory bite, I became a little happier. The wine by the glass was only $5-$6 dollars and at the end, the waiter brought us a couple additional desserts to make sure we tried them all. Just what my waistline needed...but I had a bite, and I think the lemon tart is my favorite. Vincent's Market Bistro has definitely been added to the rotation of favorite places to dine with character. And when I walked outside and the heat hit my face, I didn't even mind because I had such a great time at Vincent's.Id love to share with you my new go-to date night spot. It's filled with so much charm and romance we both were simply glowing with post dinner elation. The place, Vincent's Market Bistro is the scaled down version of the fine dining classic Vincent's of Camelback. It's funny that a place like this is so well hidden without even a hint of signage beyond a sandwich board on the street. Just look for the main Vincent's sign and follow it around back to the Market Bistro entrance, they're housed in the same building. Chef and owner Vincent Guerithault keeps the menu decidedly French with hints of Southwestern flare that he's so famous for. You should look this guy up; he's got some accolades including a James Beard award under his belt. Does kudos translate to good cookery, you bet! For one of my favorites, be sure to look for the Curly Endive Salad ($9) with mustard dressing, bacon, and a poached egg. I saw it, I ordered it, I swooned over it. A well balanced ratio of salty, sweet and sour then fresh cracked pepper completes the equation. Pizza offerings are done well with a tender pale crust that seemed more akin to pastry then to your typical chewy crispy offering. Tarte Flambée ($8) was topped with a light cream sauce, bacon, onion and thyme. Another pork laden pizza was the Caprese ($8) topped with pesto, arugula, mozzarella and prosciutto. I just wished that the greens were put on after cooking instead of before.For dinner you'll find classics including the cooked in its own fat Crispy Duck Confit ($16) with lentils and bacon, sensing a porky theme here? The tender mallard leg was succulent and intense in flavor while the lentils performed well by countering the richness of the meat. For something a little bit lighter, I use that word loosely, order up the Coq au Vin ($10). Red wine braised chicken served atop gratin potatoes were hearty and comforting. Vincent's Market Bistro also offers a $20, 3 course Prix Fixe menu. On my last visit delights were abound with the likes of creamy Butternut Squash Ravioli, Rainbow Trout and a scrumptiously sour Lemon Tart. This has to be one of the best deals in town that I know of. I mean really, food from a James Beard award winning chef at these prices is unheard of. Great food, good prices and excellent service all set in a romantic atmosphere, well; there is one caveat, the hours. Vincent's Market Bistro closes at 8pm, so plan on eating early. We arrived around 6pm on a Saturday night and by 7pm the place was completely filled. Be sure to check their website for times including breakfast, brunch and lunch.This place is a solid 5 Stars in my book. We took our N. Scottsdale friend here for her Birthday Dinner based on reviews from some friends on Yelp and were blown away with every aspect of this Beautiful Market Bistro. Once you find the entrance and park your car you walk up to a colorful patio decorated like you would see in a French painting by Claude Monet. You notice everyone there enjoying themselves with a glass of fine wine and a table full of tasty goodies. The inside is interestingly charming and colorfully decorated in the same eloquent fashion. Nice.We got there early to avoid the crowds and it was perfect. We were also greeted instantly and told to sit wherever we wanted. The server showed up faster than if I had a magic wand. He informed us of the specials while he got our drink orders going as well as bringing us a complementary plate of some of the best tasting buttery croissants I have ever had before. We asked a few questions and he happily answered us with no hesitation and was most informative.We started with the Smoked Salmon Quesadilla with Dill & Horseradish Cream for $10 and it was delicious. For entrées, the ladies ordered Sautéed Salmon with Herb Rice and Basil Beurre Blanc for $12.50 and Beef Bourguignon with Mashed Potatoes for $14. I selected the Seafood Skewer with Pesto Sauce and Scalloped Potatoes for $13 off the specials menu. We were all amazed at how nicely the vegetables were cooked just right. The fresh ingredients, textures and flavors were spectacular with all the dishes. Could not help asking for another plate of croissants to sop up all the extra juices and sauces since I was told by the wife not to lick the plate. When we thought we were done the server brings each of us a small plate of flourless chocolate cake topped with a mini scoop of vanilla ice cream and a drizzle of chocolate syrup. Yummo!We had such a great time there and the bill was very reasonable for the quality of the food and the friendly service we received. We will definitely be coming back again sooner than later. Fantastique!We've eaten at Vincent Market Bistro several times over the past year, and we never have had a bad meal.  The restaurant itself is very cozy and cute, the prices are very reasonable, and the servers and staff are really sweet and professional.  It's a great place to get brunch.My boyfriend and I both like the smoked salmon quesadillas and the 3 cheese tartine.  For entrees, I often get the herb shrimp crepe with avocado corn salsa, but my boyfriend prefers the crispy duck confit.  We both really like the sautweed salmon, too.The chef uses really fresh ingredients.  So, everything that comes out of the kitchen is really yummy.All the desserts are wonderful, too.  We usually share either the creme brulee or peach tart at the end of our meals here.
Christo's Ristorante=I was here with a very large group, so I'm trying to take that into account when judging the service... and actually the service wasn't bad. The restaurant itself had a bit of an odor to it near the front, but it was nice enough inside. Our table was next to a baby grand where someone was layin out some decent lounge. It provided an interesting atmosphere.The food... they had a lot of specials and it was really too much to keep track of - I come to find out they are 8 - 15 bucks more than a regular menu item anyway, so I abandoned that idea. I ended up with Fettuccine Alfredo with Chicken. The bread they gave us was good. For our first course, they brought out some potato soup for every one - including me, even though I said I wouldn't eat it... kinda wasteful when some of their dishes "go to feed the homeless" (whatever that means). They brought out a salad as well - I ordered a Caesar which carried an up-charge from the standard house salad of 3.50. The Caesar was drowning in dressing and all the salads just seemed plopped on the plate after being slathered in heavy dressing. At these prices with courses and such, I kinda expect a little more attention to be paid to presentation. As I said though, we were a large group and they were very good about getting our food out in a timely fashion.Our entrees were also drowning in sauce. My Alfredo was tasty and the chicken was really good, but the noodles were a little chopped up and difficult to fork up and it was a little too rich and heavy for me. I still feel kinda greasy.I think this place would earn 4 stars if the prices were more reasonable. We paid 85 bucks between two of us and that included a bottle of wine for 24 bucks (their cheapest red - which I had before elsewhere and was actually very good). I think this is a good place, but I think it sees itself as being better than it is. In some ways, it lives up to these self-imposed expectations and in other ways it doesn't. I liked it, but I didn't love it.Highlights of Christo's* The neighborhoody Italian cafe feel of the restaurant.* Decent food with run-of-the-mill upscale Italian variety.* Piano jazz player serenading guests.* Crowd with a decidedly old-money North Central Phoenix feel as opposed to the "I eat cat food and go to buffets" Sun City feel. * Professional servers with the memory of an elephant and the attitude of a menopausal woman.I had not been to Christo's in a few years, but upon returning I found the food and atmosphere to be just as consistent.  The restaurant is very neighborhoody and inviting. The white tablecloths and piano player in the corner set the mood just right. You see diners here running into old friends at the bar. I did as well.  Little old bitties threw their judging looks our way from the bar, since our table of 20 is young, mostly female, we must all be lesbians, right?   Right.  Consistently good food, not great and not excellent, but good.   Modest soups and side salads here are part of the drill.  I ordered the chicken limone, breaded and prepared similar to chicken picatta but minus the capers.  I tasted my friend's grilled salmon and penne and it was delicious. Considering out large party, the restaurant handled us OK, especially given the the busyness of the evening since it was Dining Out for Life evening where they donate proceeds toward HIV charities.I extended the benefit of the doubt, but expressed concerns over the somewhat long wait time.   It was nearly 10 pm when we left given our 7:30 reservations, in which we were promptly seated.  Our server,  who was skilled at reciting the dozen or so specials of the day, was accommodating, up until the billing situation (which I prepared him for beforehand) - when he turned a little catty, but all was well in the end. This is a 3 star place with potential for four stars.Christo's is OK if your into three courses in less than 45 minutes. I was expecting to dine here but it was much more similar to a diner experience were you get whammed bammed and thank you'd as we were in and out in a jiffy.My husband loves classic Italian Foods and according to reviews Christo's seemed like a top destination. Honestly in general the food was OK but not great and nothing I'd drive out of my way for. I almost never consider service as part of my review since it varies all the time everywhere but in this case it sort of even lessened the experience so MUCH that I have to consider it otherwise I would have given Christo's three stars.Our waiter quickly greats us and ask if we want the menu or the restaurant week special. Despite being around 70 years old he was very quick talking and very speedy and sort of made us nervous but what really bothered me the most was him  and his helpers standing there not to far from us with his arms crossed just watching us like a hawk eating the whole time. Now the food.I started with a Christo's Caesar Salad. I could tell the dressing was house made as well as the croutons. The dressing wasn't properly emulsified nor was it balanced in flavors and was super heavy with lemon. The croutons were crisp and buttery. I pointed out the faults since I know them but it really was an OK salad. I do note I wasn't offered fresh ground pepper, nicer restaurants do offer fresh ground pepper for Caesar Salads.I was sort of excited to have the classic dish Sole Meuniere here. The Christo's Version is nontraditional as the fish seemed heavily coated (maybe battered not sure) with flour in a lemon white wine sauce in stead of a traditional lightly floured and prepared in browned butter. The fresh spinach on the side was just plain without anything on it. Desserts seemed house made and were OK. We both liked the lemon cake better over the mousse.A glass of house wine was included with our dinners and during the meal we finished it and my husband ordered another round. He noticed a price difference from the menu and questioned our server. The server confirmed it wasn't the same price as the menu and said that for restaurant week they up charge the wine. It was only a few dollars but I feel this is bad business and not good for customer relations.I was really torn between two and three stars but the surprise of the wine up charge, being really rushed though dinner and with the waiter and his help all standing across from us just watching us the whole time in a unprofessional way sort of spoiled the dining experience.2.5 Stars
Spinato's Pizza=I have an obsession with Spinato's pizza. It could have something to do with the sauce, or the homemade Italian sausages or the soft chewy pizza dough, but whatever it is, I just can't get enough. This past weekend, I finally had the chance to visit this location. We dined in the intimate dining room amongst families enjoying a pizza on the town. The service was on par, the atmosphere was nice but the best part of the night was the delicious pizza. It's so good I force myself to enter a food coma just to have another piece. The pizza is Chicago thin-crust pizza with fluffy and soft square pieces of pizza with their signature sweet pizza sauce that makes their pizza what it is. For pizza parlor pizza, this is hands down my favorite. I just wish they had one closer to where I lived!News alert: While there, I learned that they are moving locations in the next couple weeks, so before you visit, give them a call to make sure they haven't moved locations yet!
Blue Restaurant & Bar=The atmosphere and the service made my evening with friends so much more pleasant that I will definitely be back. The food was good, the Mediterranean salad was amazing, that dressing was tasty and not overbearing, the orange chicken was well cooked but not as special as I hoped for, then again, I can't expect miracles from chicken. The desert (tres leches) was great, super sweet so not for everyone but tasty.We decided to check out Blue during the Dine Out Charlotte weekend since the menu looked pretty darn appetizing. We dressed for a night out on the town, and despite her dress and my shirt and snazzy dress jeans we still felt slightly under-dressed. Blue has the looks of a fancy smancy place and dishes out food that exceeds expectations.We arrived on a Saturday evening at 6 and were blown away the second we walked in the door. The place simply screams "swanky" with a sharp, classy interior and interesting dining room layout. The host and servers were extremely formal and proper, which only made us feel like we were somewhere we didn't belong. But enough about the ambiance...on to the food!After taking our drink orders (the wine list is like gigantic!) the waitress brought over some complimentary bread and butter. The bread consisted of a cheese focaccia which was warm and cheesy, and there was also a dark cranberry walnut that was equally tasty. The bread is served with a dish of kalamata olive butter which I'm always a fan of. I can't explain it...I hate olives but I love it when they are infused in butter!For an appetizer I ordered the caesar salad with pork belly croutons. The salad is served a la wedge and lightly drizzled with a caesar dressing. Alongside the lettuce was some roasted tomatoes (not a fan of tomaters, but the missus loved them) and carmelized red onion, which went good with the lettuce. But the real kicker was the pork belly croutons. Don't let the name fool you...these are not dried, hard chunks of pork. There was at least six decent sized balls of pork belly on top of the plate. Each one was deep fried to perfection, giving it a hot, crunchy outside yet retaining the juicy, succulent pork belly inside. It was like eating a deep fried ball of the white fatty part of bacon...it was just that damn good. This pork belly is not for everyone, but if you're proud to be a bacon fat kind of person, this little tasting of heaven is something you can't miss.The missus ordered the calamari as her appetizer. The calamari was kind of "meh", and the batter was way too heavy and just wasn't good. The plate also comes with some fried olives and hot peppers which she devoured in a heart beat. I wouldn't recommend the calamari since I've had better quality stuff at lesser restaurants.For dinner I ordered the bison osso buco, and it was nothing short of tastetacular. Six huge hunks of slow-cooked bison meat sat upon a bed of roasted root veggies. The bison was awesome, and I love getting it when it's on a menu. It was also refreshing to see bison as an actual dish and not just a burger. The meat was lean yet still moist from whatever magic the cook worked on it. The bison juices all mingled with the root veggies which consisted of carrots, potatoes and some others. Oh, and I almost forgot the spetzel! There's spetzel mixed in with the veggies and it was crispy yet chewy, and simply perfect. This was one heck of a dish and a great alternative for the steak lover who wants to try something new.The missus got the pan seared scallops, and these things were massive! The sea scallops were cooked to perfection and served with a great seasoning and sauce. The dish came with broccolini and other veggies that were SMOKED (awesome!) and a potatoe puree that was pretty darn good. Now the portions here are huge...you're getting a full meal, not a small fancy tasting. We both ate half our entrees and took the leftovers home for dinner the following night (still tasted awesome reheated!) We weren't fully stuffed yet, but we had to save room for dessert. I ordered the sticky toffee pudding, and if you have a sweet tooth this is the dessert for you. The toffee "pudding" is actually baked so it's more cake-like, and its served upon a sea of melty caramel sauce. There are some hard toffee chips sprinkled about to give some texture, and on top of the pudding is a heaping scoop of dulche de leche gelato that was awesome. The toffee, caramel and dulche flavors were all great on their own, but when combined into one mighty spoonful I achieved dessert nirvana. This is one of the best desserts I've had in the area, and there is no way I would go back here and not order it.The missus had the baklava for dessert and gobbled it all up. There was pistachio and pear stuffed inside this huge Greek pastry, and it was served with a side of marscapone cheese. Bakalava isn't normally my thing but I won't deny the tastiness of this dessert, though it was definitely second to the sheer power of the toffee pudding.Blue is a swanky place, and you will pay for the ambiance through your food, which isn't exactly on the cheap side. We would not want to pay full price for a meal here (simply because it's a bit out of our price range) but it would make for a tempting Restaurant Week visit.
Palm Restaurant=It's quite rare that hubs and I give a restaurant (or any business for that matter) varying star ratings. In fact, I really can't name one other business we've been to where our reviews span more than one star apart. Therefore, I'm surprised to say that, overall, The Palm didn't knock my socks off. Was it a nice meal? Yes. Was it worth the money? No. And here's the why to it all.The place: The Palm Steakhouse, SouthPark, Charlotte-NCThe occasion: Our three-year wedding anniversaryThe channel of reservation: Open TableThe scene: Beautiful night on the patio, very empty on a Monday eveningWe made an Open Table reservation and noted that it was our wedding anniversary...it was a special night, not just a fly by for a quick steak. As mentioned, the patio is great although you really just look out into a wide driving lane that heads towards the Hampton Inn. Our server, Fernando, was top notch. Really, five stars for the service all the way around. Very formal but completely in tune with the cadence of the meal and the guest's needs. The food, however, is where I take issue...especially for the price.Beefsteak tomato Capri salad: 4/5: Big slices of bright red tomato with hunks of fresh mozzarella and basil. Props to Fernando for lightly pouring on the oil and balsamic at the table. Nice touch. Chilean Sea Bass: 3/5: The fish was beautiful - really a great filet. However, I knew it would be sauteed in a white wine butter sauce, not swimmin' in it. The delicate fish was sitting in a pool and drowning in the sauce. Goat cheese whipped potatoes: 3/5: Fairly tasty mashed taters, but nothing out of the ordinary. I didn't taste too much of the goat cheese and they required a heavy hand of salt and pepper to liven them up. Creme brulee: 2/5: As some may know, I'm a total treat monster and the creme brulee came highly recommended. The flavors were bright - light with just a hint of citrus, but the bruleed top was ice cold and the middle of the creme was also super chilly. I have a feeling this was refrigerated for a long time and the texture and temperature suffered. Other notes: The shrimp cocktail is $18.90. Are you kidding me? That's insane. Also, there is not a petite filet...only a 9 oz. option for $43. This served as the reason why I went with fish instead of steak. I did, however, try a few bites of hubs' steak and it was cooked perfectly and was very well flavored. Additionally, I was a bit surprised that, considering the great service, no one wished us a happy anniversary in any way. Overall, our meal for two people, with a few drinks added in, came to $200. I'm completely fine shelling out some coin for a great meal, but The Palm fell short for me.
McCormick & Schmicks Seafood Restaurant=This is easily one of the best if not THE BEST happy hour value in the Valley.  I hold Caffe Boa very highly in that regard too.I was a regular for McCormick and Schmick's happy hour in Downtown LA.  Since moving to Phoenix, I seem to forget it's even here, in it's hidden Esplanade office tower location.Five appetizers are $1.99 and another handful are $4.99.  Their claim to their happy hour fame is the 1/2 pound angus burger.  The Angus burger, which comes with steak fries, is decently sized and pretty good for $2 bucks.  Not the best burger I have ever had, but good considering the chump change you pay, it's a steal. Bobo and I splurged and ordered enough food for everyone in the bar, where you could just about hear a pin drop.  The calamari strips and grilled salmon cakes were pretty good too.  Bass and Hef on tap are $5 each.Granted we were also there at 9 pm for their reverse happy hour, (which is another added bonus) and watched as the last of the douchey corporate expense account 24th and Camelback crowd dwindled.Service by the outgoing server Teresa was solid, and if you're even remotely in the area, I highly suggest it for some good cheap fun post-work.If it wasn't for the happy hour it would probably be a three star place for the corporate seafood chainey feel.I usually have a hard time persuading Mom to join me for a restaurant meal.  Not so when I bring up seafood at McCormick & Schmick's!  We both enjoy the sour dough table bread and butter that is only given when requested.  Lunch items are decent in prices and portions.  I find that the dayshift staff here are more friendly and efficient than the night shift.  The lunch meals flowed very smoothly: glasses always full and extra hot bread brought to the table when asked (w/out our having to repeat ourselves).  Happy hour and dinner services are something else entirely.I don't deny that happy hour apps are nicely priced.  I've only experienced HH here once, and it took awhile before I found a table I wanted to sit at (outside was noisy and smoky, and the only chairs available by the bar inside were at the ends).  It took quite some time before my server arrived.  I usually only order HH apps since I rarely drink, but she told me I had to order a drink, any drink that costs at least $2.75, before I could take advantage of the HH app specials.  So I ordered my first (and so far, my last) Arnold Palmer, which is a beverage that is half-tea and half-lemonade.  For apps, I tried the clam strips, fish tacos, and the cheeseburger and fries.  I thought the clam strips were too bread-y: not much clam-meat, just batter and seasoning.  It tasted pre-frozen.  The fish tacos were decent, but not filling.  The star app here were the cheeseburger and fries!  The burger was HUGE!!  The fries were numerous in quantity, too!  The pleasant surprise in the value of the burger and fries mitigated the disappointment I felt over the clam strips.  One huge complaint, however, was the fact that my server only saw me once, and that was to get my drink and appetizer orders.  She never came back to check on whether I would like another drink or something else from the HH and dinner menus.  Mom and I had dinner here last night (Saturday).  I couldn't believe how dead it was, considering it was only 8:15p.  We already knew we wanted to order the Dungeness crab and shrimp bisque for her and the mixed grill special for me (salmon, seabass with coconut rice and asparagus, and the shrimp-crabcake, which Mom could have since I have a shrimp allergy (sob!  I LOVE crabcakes!).  The mixed grill entree also comes with creme brulee!  Mom wasn't sure which size soup to order, but our male server told us that the cup was very small in portion, so I asked for the bowl (which, in the end, was too much).  We also asked for bread, which thankfully arrived within a few minutes.  The soup took another ten minutes.  Mom didn't think it was anything special.  Indeed, she thought that the Red Lobster bisque we enjoyed in Illinois years ago was much better.  I do remember the bread bowls of deliciousness from years past; we loved the chunkiness of the RL bisque, as well.  I told her that the higher-tabbed venues seem to serve less-chunky and more silky-smooth pureed bisques (we both agreed that chunky bisques are the best!). The mixed grill took more than 40 minutes from the time I placed the order, which is unacceptable.  Grilled seafood doesn't take long to cook!!  The entree was very delicious, though, but I would be hard-pressed to order it again if it is going to take this long to prepare.  I was also disappointed to see that the coconut rice contained *.  I LOVE *, but my immune system doesn't, and nowhere in the menu description was it mentioned that * were included.  Mom took the tainted half, but I still ended with vertigo and painful abdominal cramps from eating the "clean" half (it seemed like the rice was pre-molded in a tiny bowl or ice-cream scoop with the * in the bottom of the mold, and then placed onto the plate).  The * looked beautiful in the presentation (and Mom thought the rice tasted fine), but had I known sooner, I'd have requested them to be omitted, or at least be placed on the side.  I loved the salmon and the seabass, which were perfectly seasoned, but I found the rice too squishy, as if too much liquid was used.  The sticks of asparagus were perfectly crunchy and great in flavor!  Mom absolutely loved the crabcake... I was so jealous!  Service was objectionable: long waiting time, 2nd request for bread was forgotten, and the wait times for the seafood, brulee (yum!), and ticket were too long in between.Hope to give a favorable happy hour update!  I'd like to try some of those grilled salmon cakes Stevie P. mentioned.  I'll have to take everybody's word on the margaritas' goodness... Not much of a drinker to justify my spending $10 on one drink.  (Although, Roy's Hawaiian Martini is definitely worth paying $10 for... so smooth!)Sat at the bar and had Byron, nice guy, waiting on me.  I wasn't too thrilled when I saw that the $5 happy hour red wine selection was a Penfolds (?) cab/shiraz blend, but Byron said it was good, so ordered it.  (I'm not fond of shiraz...)Chose the deep-fried zucchini and the blackened cajun-spiced chicken sandwich with fries off of the $1.95 menu, with the chicken sandwich selection entered first.  It's a good thing I added the zucchini, as it arrived much earlier than the sandwich.  I'd already polished the dish off (nice, light, crispy coating of panko with a side of rather tasteless ranch dressing), as I ended up waiting another 8 to 10 minutes for the sandwich to arrive.  The sandwich was good (loved the spice rub!), allthough I had to throw away the **.  Still a good-portioned meal without the omitted items, as it came with a side of fries.Didn't feel comfortable enough to take photos of the food... Don't know why as I usually don't let what others think influence my actions, but there you have it.  I think happy hour at Roaring Fork's spoiled me a little bit...11/25/102.5 stars.Wasn't able to secure a reservation at either Chandler's or Ahwatukee's Mimi's Cafe, but I did have two reservations at Rustler's Rooste and McCormick & Schmick's.  Mom didn't relish the thought of having to dine outside at RR's, so M&S it had to be.Reservation was for two at 8p, and knowing we'd be slightly tardy (we arrived at 8:05p), I'd called before we left and was told that there wouldn't be any problems keeping the reservation.  It took about 10 minutes to be seated, which wasn't so bad, considering that the hosts seemed disorganized and slightly frantic, and there were about 10 or more people waiting in a scattered formation before us (it was VERY cold outside, and no one wanted to feel the breeze everytime someone opened the doors!).  However, it took another 15 mins. before our server greeted us, which also meant we had to wait that long before getting a sip of water!Food was, on the whole, delicious (w/ a few exceptions), but it was the timing that ruined the experience for us.  After being served water, we both ordered the Turkey dinner, each w/ a choice of side (Mom chose the sweet potato crumble, and I the macaroni and cheese), plus a side salad and dessert (cheesecake or upside-down apple pie- we both chose the pie).  Mom also wanted the calamari app.  How I wished I'd listened to our server when he recommended the crumble over the mac 'n cheese after I'd asked him which was better :(  The SPC was heaven (!), while the mac needed more cooking time.  Even the replacement wasn't any good.  The sliced oven-roasted turkey dinner was terrific, which included mashed potatoes, stuffing, fresh cranberry sauce, crispy green beans, and sliced carrots.  We were served cheesecake, instead of apple pie, and when we nicely pointed out the mistake, we were told that the apple pie would take a little longer as it was still baking, and the cheesecake was taken away.  Mom didn't care for the pie; I, on the other hand, really liked the homemade filling!Run-down of the timing of food delivery:8:25p- Water and server greeting.8:35p- Salad and app. delivered.9:25p- Turkey dinner entrees arrived.10:10p- Cheesecake slices placed on table and taken away shortly after.10:40p- Upside-down apple pie slices presented.10:55p- Credit receipt delivered and signed.As I mentioned above, food was solid (w/ exception to the mac 'n cheese and cheesecake mis-step), but service was extremely lacking.Even the women's restroom needed dire attention... Perhaps M&S' 4th year of T-day dinner will be more successful (I think this was the 3rd year since they first offered it), but I won't be back to find out.  Next Turkey day dining out, I'll make sure to place my reservation at Mimi's ahead of time!
Uncle Sam's=Just not "all that".  Pretty much bar food.A yelper recommended this place as being the BEST cheesesteak in town.  Sadly my cheesesteak ...  was .... well ... just a pretty good cheesesteak.  I guess I don't know how you can screw up or enhance such a thing so I don't know what I was expecting.The atmosphere is straight up sports bar and they seem to dress their waitresses in "Hooters-esque" tops ... not my thing.  Not a bad place ... just "there".Memories, pressed between the pages of my mind ... Memories, sweetened thru the ages just like wine...Oh the memories this Uncle Sam's has for me. My entire extended family used to use this as our impromptu reunion spot when I was a wee child.  We still meet up here on occasion for nostalgia's sake.My two female cousins used to torture me and I would end up in the bathroom crying every single time. That is until I called my cousin a hooker. Nobody knew what it meant, but it stopped their constant berating so it did the trick.I cannot imagine a better happy hour. Pitchers of premium beer are $2.99 and their food is like $3. You can get a bud light on draft for $0.75 if you are into that sort of thing.I always get the cheese hoagie (Cold) with the sweet peppers. Delish. Everything here is good, though, including the pizza, fries, and mozzarella sticks. The only reason they don't get a five is because they have horrific service. Sorry, it's true.Come. Enjoy. Watch Football. Play the Vintage Pacmen Game. Just don't let your cousins torture you for five years.. just call them a hooker from the get go. Trust me, it works.That awkward moment when you realise that you get what you pay for. I actually use to really like this place. Great happy hour. Good flavors on the wings. I guess the awkward part of it all is that I'm not 23 anymore and my expectations are higher than they use to be. Like tonight, for example. I placed an easy order of happy hour wings and a brew. Well... no. I got a full order. When I informed the server ( young red head with tats behind her ears and plugs) that I only ordered a small order of wings, she offered to get me a box. I figured this was so she didn't have to get management involved with the switch or what not, despite my eager suggestion. Needless to say, the evening continued. I eat one wing... literally one! A cockroach walks onto the bar. It was small and may have been a beetle, but still... ew! ! There goes my appetite!  Words of advice.  If you do decide to come to good ol' Unc' Sam's, wear protection. Serves with mediocre at best. The gals working there are 12, so I don't expect much I suppose. However,  the Peoria location is much better and cleaner ( it seems like). I'm only giving two stars because of the cheap beer and the decent wings. Not good!!! Just decent. I think the beer helps. Long story short. If you have a party and want cheap cheapness... well then you've found... omg... an other cockroach just walked up on the bar! Are you absolutely kidding me!? Im seriously about to freak out and walk out. I don't care if I haven't paid. This is embarrassing!!! DO. NOT.  EAT. HERE!!!
Red Sea Restaurant & Bar=Meskerem is to Red Sea as Harris Teeter is to Food Lion. As in, less atmosphere, spottier service, but good deals and (in some cases) surprisingly good food. A complaint I often hear about Ethiopian is that it all tastes the same - whether that's actually true (I don't think so) or it's a result of our western minds being so used to each separate dish having, well, it's own, separate dish, that when it's all piled onto a delicious piece of Injera, the way we experience flavor shifts is a mystery to me. At Red Sea, there is no mistaking Wat for Alicha - the flavors in each dish (even just stewed lentils) are distinct. Some things are sweet - others salty. And there's none of this "spice level" stuff - you get the full range, when ordering a combo (at 10.99, veggie combo is a steal).Dings - nuked Sambusas. Service was both good (presence, smiles) and cranky (unhappiness about splitting a bill 3 ways, each portion on a card). Warm, as in tired A/C. But really good, thoughtfully prepared food. Lovely.
Chuck E Cheese's Pizza=Why on earth would anyone come to this location?  I don't know where to begin with my issues with this establishment.  From the salad bar that needed maintenance to the restrooms.  This is a place with kids, most of the them under the age of 12, the bathrooms need to have a regular schedule for cleaning and restocking, especially on the weekends!  Kids in general are messy, but now you have a couple hundred running through a restroom, it needs to be cleaned regularly.I was so disappointed to see that the staff only appeared for the birthday party and to drop off food, but when I looked around, I only saw one person out sweeping and trying to clean up and the person at the entrance.  Other than that, I would occasionally see a person come from the back and look around and go back to the back..  You have kids running around wildly.  Everyone at work that's not cooking should be out trying to man the restaurant floor.  Hand sanitizers ran out in the play area, but people working there were waking around doing nothing.I will return if a kid I know is having a party there, but I won't be eating the food.
Malee's Thai Bistro=Well I am probably going to be pretty unpopular with this review but sometimes you just got to have your say. I find it astonishing that most people criticize places like this because it is not "authentic". I understand what they mean but please. This is Phoenix Arizona. Not Bangkok or Chang  Mai, Thailand. And I'll be honest. I've been fortunate enough to spend time in Thailand and the food really didn't appeal to me as much. Same with Indian food. The Indian food in London is stellar. A really special blend of different regional fares. In India? It seemed pretty ordinary.So yes, I am making a crazy statement. That possibly the most "authentic" food might not actually be the most interesting.With that ridiculous statement made, I love this place. Yes, I agree the place runs with the efficiency of a zoo sometimes. And sometimes the wait staff need a good kick up the arse. But for the most part, the food is excellent. Tasty and satisfying. Every now and then a dish comes out ill prepared. But I've had that experience in many places, bar the expensive ones.So forget trying to frame the place against "the real deal" and enjoy it for what it is!
Burger King=Let me start with I have seen cleaner homicides than their bathroom /: I should've left but I was starving. Place not even busy stood there for 5 minutes to get ask "what you want?" I ordered sausage croissant meal w coffee to go.The sandwich cold, the hash browns hard enough to break a tooth.I know its fast food but come on. Now sitting at dr office starving.NEVER AGAIN BKYeah, I know. It's Burger King. It's a chain. But I've got this veggie burger fix list, and honestly, the BK Veggie is my default when I'm also in a hurry. I mean, it's quick, it's easy, and BK's the only fast food place that's got a veggie burger. I mean, it's Morning Star, they can't fuck it up. Stick it in a bun, throw on some mayo, some ketchup, some lettuce, you're good to go. No cheese - you gotta ask for cheese, and I'm sure they charge extra for it, like 20 cents or something. I just spent like 5 minutes looking for the cent key on my keyboard btw - wtf? What happened to the cent key? Didn't there used to be a cent key on keyboards? Over the 6, right? Is it a Mac thing? Do you have one? I just got this effin arrowhead looking thing.. ^ WTF?
Ken's Meat's & Deli=I stopped here after a friend recommended the place for steaks. Impressive selection! There were several cuts that are pre-marinated. The prices were extremely cheap compared to other places such as Metcalfs.To compare, I spent almost $60 on steaks for 6 people and bought the same amount of meat here at Ken's for $20...and they were marinated. I tried the burgandy peppercorn steaks...WOW!! These guys melt in your mouth!Usually leftovers steaks are tough but after several days in the fridge, the leftover steaks were still as tender as the day they came off the grill. I'm doing all my meat shopping here from now on!
JT's Bar & Grill=This is first and foremost a neighborhood DIVE BAR. However, it is a dive bar with old school charm, style, and personality. The food here is shockingly good. The wings I ordered were fantastic - they grill them AFTER they apply the hot sauce to impart a less slimy texture. I sat at the bar and watched burger after delicious burger roll off the grill - I will be trying one of those on my next visit. Downside: it was warm, and the bathroom needs serious help! Note: It gets really packed around dinner time and the service can be slow - so take a deep breath, relax, and they will get to you in good time... I really enjoyed the change of pace.Jt's Bar & Grill is exactly what I have been looking for in the Valley! Neighborhood dive bar where everyone seemed to know each other, insanely friendly service (shout out to Kerri!) and killer bar food and chicken wings of epic proportions! I am a chicken wing connoisseur, and frankly Jt's may have the best chicken wings I have EVER had! They deep fry those baby's, sauce em and throw them on the grill. They have several choices of sauces the best was the works which featured all of their sauces mixed together minus their suicide sauce which produced a delicious and not too spicy wing! I like my wings ultra spicy so I ordered a side of the Suicide sauce, which I personally loved - definitely spicy but not so that your mouth is on fire. Their wings will set you back $7.50 for a dozen ( Which makes me love this place more!). They have a pretty large beer selection on tap and every liquor you would want! This place is def going to be apart of my repertoire and it should be for you too!
Eliana's Restaurant=Very Cute and Cozy Place! The Food was AMAZING! Seriously I have been thinking about it all day and whether my diet likes it or not I'll be returning very soon! I got the Appetizer Platter which came with a Pupusa, a chicken meat pie, a chicken tamale and beans. (see pics) Everything was wonderful and fresh and oh so Delicious! I would have to tell anyone who has never had this kind of food, do not be intimidated, go for it you won't be sorry, my particular meal wasn't spicy or greasy it was just the best thing I have tasted in weeks and it's definitely budget friendly!
The Dor-Stop Restaurant=You know how JImmy Buffet has Cheeseburger in Paradise? Mine is more like Pancake in Paradise and this place is it! While Pamela's serves up the amazing thin crepe-like pancakes, The Dor-Stop serves up the fluffy equivalent. The list of different combos goes on and on. And if you're with a really good friend, you can order two different ones and split them! Genius!I split the banana chocolate chip pancakes and the pumpkin pancakes. While the pumpkin was incredible, I think I slightly more enjoyed the banana chocolate chip just because the combo is such a winning one! But come fall, I may be all over the pumpkin ones again. Although, I'd probably be cheating myself because I have to work my way down the list of them all!The only thing that would pull me away would be the french toast. It almost seems cruel I have to choose between the two! And it's so dirt cheap too! I think for three people it was around $25 bucks. With coffee and some sides! I think there's some other stuff on the menu, but who knows if I'll ever even experience them... how can I with those pancakes!Ok, so I know this place is somewhat of an institution now because of their Food Network exposure, but I'm going to have to go against the grain here and say that I did not enjoy my Dor-Stop experience.We came here many months ago after hearing all of the hype. I'd never been to Dormont before and we were eager to check out this place and the neighborhood in general (side bar: Dormont is adorable! If it were a bit more convenient to where we work and like to play, I would totally live there). Anyhow, so we get there on a Saturday morning, and the place is packed. No biggie, most good breakfast spots usually have a wait on a weekend morning. I think we waited about 30 mins, which wasn't bad. We're seated, we order, everything is just peachy. Then things started to go sour.It had been about 40 minutes since we were seated and we still hadn't received our food. Other diners who were seated after us had received their food and were finishing up. Our waitress hadn't stopped by our table in a long time. I had started to wonder if maybe our ticket was lost (ordinarily I wouldn't think anything of it, but the fact that people seated after us had gotten their food made me think something might have been wrong). Anyway, so the next time we see our waitress walk by, we flag her down and ask her if she knew when our food would be out. We asked politely. We weren't snarky, we weren't mean, we didn't roll our eyes or snap our fingers. It was a simple question, one that I think many would probably ask. And the waitress replied, "Are you really hungry or just really impatient?" No hint of a smile on her face. No twinkle in her eyes. It was clear that she wasn't joking (not that it would have been funny anyway). Hmm. Are we really hungry or really impatient? Well, neither...we just wanted to make sure our ticket hadn't gotten lost. We sat in stunned silence, unsure of how we should respond to such a flat-out rude remark. The waitress left, and finally brought our food out about 10 minutes later (and then we never saw her again except for when she dropped off the check). By that point, our appetites were pretty much gone, and we just wanted to leave. So we scarfed down our food and got the heck out of dodge.I dunno. Maybe the waitress was having a bad day. Maybe she gets asked that question a lot (by actual impatient people) and is sick of hearing it. But we were very polite to her and didn't deserve to be treated like that. I don't care how good your food is (and for the record, the food was okay, but certainly not mind blowing for the all the hype), if you have lousy customer service, I can't support you. And it's a shame, because I really, really wanted to like this place (it looks like such a cute mom and pop place). With so many other great breakfast spots in the Burgh, I'd rather go somewhere that cares about giving their customers a good (or at least not a blatantly bad) experience.Well, looks like I'm adding yet another 5-star review for Dor-Stop. But hey, they definitely deserve it! In fact Dor-Stop is so good that I came here two days in a row a couple weekends ago - once for a sit-down meal, and once to get a meal to-go just so I could try a second item on the menu.I actually hadn't eaten at Dor-Stop in years until earlier this month - their hours and my schedule don't tend to mesh. But one afternoon I just happened to be using 1/2 a vacation day, so I came with a family member. Since it was the middle of the day on a Friday, the place was fairly empty, which I definitely didn't mind - this place is pretty cozy and so it gets cramped quickly during weekend dining rushes.But on to the food, the important part of this review! My dining companion ordered a salad - complete with French fries, 'cause that's how we do salads in Pittsburgh - and I ordered their Feta Burger. Sure, their Raspberry stuffed french toast caught my eye...but Feta burger! How often do you see that on the menu? And I loved that burger, by the way - it was well cooked and the toppings blended perfectly (I snagged a few mushrooms from my companion's salad which made it even better), and definitely felt like good diner food. I left feeling super happy with my meal.Buuuuut...the next day I still couldn't get that french toast of my mind. I just couldn't. So I called in an order for pick-up - good thing I did, too, because there was nowhere to sit when I came in! Saturdays are definitely jam-packed here, understandably so. Well, I got my food, brought it home, and proceeded to devour it. Just, YUM! Seriously - that french toast is a MUST!If I was going to complain about anything it would be that the seating really isn't the most comfortable on the planet, buuuuut...I can't hold it against them. I just can't. Not after that french toast. See you next time, Dor-Stop!I visited the Dor Stop for brunch this past Sat. with CM.  Given that we were headed out to South Park for a hike, and we wanted to get brunch beforehand, I suggested we take the opportunity to try the Dor Stop, since Dormont was on the way and I'd heard great things about their brunch (not to mention that they were on DDD!).  In hopes of beating the late-rising rush, we arrived at around 10:30, and it worked out perfectly, since we only had to wait about 15 min. to be seated.Once we were seated, we were promptly greeted and given menus by one of the waitstaff.  Having checked out the reviews ahead of time, I knew I wanted to try the raspberry French toast.  I mentioned the other items that had been featured on DDD--and that people enjoy, based on the reviews--to CM, and he decided to go with the famous pumpkin pancakes (yeah, that's what I call them, rather than hot cakes--so sue me!).  Our order was taken promptly, and was delivered to our table about 10 min. after ordering.  My French toast looked exactly like I expected, based on the pictures--it consisted of four toast points covered with raspberry sauce, and drizzled with raspberry jam.  The toast was perfectly crispy, and the sauce was delicious and flavorful--it was everything I could want in a sweet brunch item!  However, I did find the name of this dish a bit misleading, since the toast itself wasn't actually stuffed, unlike other versions I've tried before.I tried a bite of CM's pumpkin pancakes, and they were also delectable--unlike most pancakes I've had, they were quite moist even without any syrup, and definitely included real pumpkin, rather than just pumpkin pie spice, like many pumpkin items I've tried.  The butter added some welcome savoriness to the sweetness of the pancakes, and a bit of syrup added some additional moistness.  Since both of our dishes came with a breakfast meat, we ordered bacon (duh!), which provided us with a supply of umami flavor when we wanted a break from the sweetness of our entrees.Overall, CM and I were very pleased with our experience at the Dor Stop.  Our total check, which included a glass of milk for me in addition to our entrees, came to around $20, which we felt was quite reasonable in light of the quality of the dishes.  Service was friendly and efficient, and the ambiance was cheerful and light-filled--exactly what I'd expect in a diner.  Even though we both felt a tad out of place among the clientele, which was almost completely white families with young children (very different than your typical East End eating establishment, which is what we're both accustomed to), we felt welcome.  Without a doubt, the Dor-Stop offers one of the best breakfasts in PGH, and doesn't disappoint for down home diner goodness!
Carlos O'Brien's=I love Yelp cause I can share my many experiences with you and the world. So today, in desperate need of a margarita, I decided to stop here with a couple of friends for a pitcher and some guacamole. After a few margaritas, I found their "healthy" menu and decided to order their  "vegan" veggie burrito. Problem was there was nothing vegan about it. After several bites of the burrito, I found a large piece of burnt steak inside. NASTY! If that wasn't enough, after consuming nearly half of the black beans it was served with, I found pieces of pork in the beans. That explains why they were so salty. I presented all of this to the manager who was kind enough to take most of everything, minus the booze, off of the bill. Revolting.I wanted to take my sister out for dinner last night to celebrate her upcoming 21st birthday prior to going to see Cirque Du Soliel. We both love Mexican food and Carlos O'Brien's is literally within walking distance from my house. We used to go all the time as kids, but it has been years since I have been there last. I'm glad we gave it a try because we had a really great experience. We were seated immediately even though it was 5:45pm. We had friendly, attentive service from both our busser and our server.We were served delicious, warm tortilla chips shortly after sitting with a tasty, fresh, and chunky salsa. They also provided the liquefied hot sauce, but I did not eat it because I do not like that kind at any restaurant.I decided on the veggie fajitas. The black beans are vegetarian, the refrieds are not. My sister selected the fajita quesedilla, sans meat.Our food arrived quickly and piping hot. Both of us had huge portion sizes and the food was extremely fresh and really tasty. They put a salty and slightly spicy seasoning on their fajitas, which come with a mixture of peppers, onions, squash, zucchini and potatoes. Back in the day when I used to eat meat (15+ years ago) I always ordered the shredded beef chimi. It was amazing. I would assume that it retains the same amazing taste and size as when I favored it as a child, but who knows.Our meal came to $21 and I gladly tipped our server over 20%! I will definitely be back when I have a cheat day on my diet!!Was my 1st time at Carlos O'Brien's, it was a friends 40th birthday dinner and this is her favorite place to go. I went with high expectations because she has told me over and over the past few years how good this place is.I arrived couple minutes after everyone was there and saw that the party (there was about 25 of us) was broken sort of into you, half the party down one side and other wrapped around the middle and the birthday girl was kind of not at either tables, just in the middle of the 2, which made it difficult for conversations to flow, you could talk to your half of the table, but if you want to talk with those on the other side of the restaurant, get up and walk over their then, needless to say, I stayed where I was at and talked amongst my fellow friends on my side, kept giving the bday girl a shout out and drinks to let her know we are here to party! Let's start with the salsa, their where 2 types, a pico de gallo and a hotter blend, which reminded me more of a smoky chipotle sauce.  Well the pico looked great, but had absolutely no flavor, no pepper ,no onion, no tomato flavor, not even the cilantro, which is my favorite ingredient to cook with, had flavor, even if you added salt and pepper to it, it didn't help.  The hotter of the two did have a nice smoky chipotle taste to it, so that was the one I went with it. I went with the filet of Salmon with mango salsa with Spanish rice and black beans.  The fish was perfectly cooked, and even though the top of the fish appeared to have some sort of rub on it, it too was lacking in flavor, I tossed on the mango salsa to see if that would help and sadly it did not, no flavor at all. I topped it with the smoky chipotle to give some sort of flavor and appearance that I'm not eating mush. The rice and beans were perfectly cooked, no issues there.  Had this dish had flavor to it, it would have been amazing, but nope it did not.Now like I said we were spilt into 2 along one sided booth table things from one end of the room to the other, and there was apx 25 if not more of us. But by the time my end of the table had gotten their food, the other half was already paying and leaving.  It was not because I was late; I got their in time for orders to be taken. This was poor planning on the server's behalf, half the party had ready left by the time we got our bills.  I was bummed because I was wanting to catch up with a friend I hadn't seen in a while and poof she was gone .  I wanted to like this place, but I'm afraid I am a onetime diner here.
Andy's Sushi Bar=I've been in Pittsburgh for a long time, and if you read through my reviews, you'll see that I love eating in Pittsburgh. I'm from NYC, so it's not that my palate is easy to satisfy. I just really think that Pittsburgh has great restaurants with authentic, and tasty foods. I am a serious advocate of dining in Pittsburgh, and I take pride in knowing the good places to eat. There, those are my self-proclaimed credentials. So take this to heart: Andy's Sushi Bar (located in Wholey's) is probably the #1 place to get sushi/rolls in Pittsburgh. Now, a few caveats: it is NOT a restaurant, it is a stand inside Wholey's supermarket that does take-out orders ONLY. You will NOT get a dining experience, so for those of you who want to go to a nice japanese restaurant for dinner, you are not in luck. This sushi stand is only open for lunch, and typically closes at about 4pm on a weekday. You could be waiting about 15-30 minutes depending on the time/day you go because there is just one guy who makes the orders. He's fast, but his line can get long. Take it for what it is: Andy uses fresh and tasty fish. He cuts you big pieces for both his a la carte pieces and his rolls. He will make you any custom order you'd like provided he has the ingredients. He does have a limited selection of Sushi/Sashimi platters. He has a good spider roll and after going a few times, definitely ask for the "Chef's Special" -- he just loads up a roll for you. You won't be disappointed.And, as for prices, it's the best bang for your buck for sushi. what more could you ask for.It really pains me to do this, because Andy himself is such a cool and friendly dude, but after eating at Penn Ave Fish Company for so long...I just can't bring myself to get his sushi anymore. It's... just... not that good.  It all snapped into place for me one day recently.  The sushi rolls he makes are massive, but the taste just isn't there.  He's rushing to make them so fast that as soon as you put your chopsticks around them they completely fall apart.  And the most important part, the fish, doesn't seem all that fresh.  Definitely not as fresh as Penn Ave., which is weird considering he "lives" in a fresh fish mecca.  But the thing I think I've really grown to hate that weird brown sauce he puts on everything.  Yuck!  I just can't stand it!  I know I can ask to have it off, but as soon as I seem to remember, it's on there in a flash.I know it may be cheap and it may be fast, but to me it's just not worth it.  Penn Ave IS right down the street...and I PROMISE you'll love their fresh and delicious sushi!
Baoding=On my continued hunt to find the best Chinese in Charlotte, I decided to check out Baoding this past Sunday night, after not visiting for more than 10 years.Upon arriving we were greeted by an extremely friendly staff and saw that almost every table was full, that is a good sign!We started with spring rolls and wonton soup. The spring rolls were light, fresh and deep fried to perfection, and served with a great dipping sauce. As for the wonton soup, one of the best of have had. The broth had an amazing flavor and came with three chicken stuffed wontons, spinach and thinly sliced eggs.As for the entrees, we ordered the Beijing Duck, duck served with plum sauce, cucumbers, scallions and thin light pancakes, and Chicken and Shrimp with mixed vegetables in a brown sauce.the Chicken and Shrimp was a large portion, allowing me to have left-overs Monday night, and was delicious. They do not skimp on the protein. As for the veggies, too many I cannot even recall, but they were cooked to perfection.As for the duck, I am not a huge duck fan, but I did make one pancake and enjoyed it very much. The plum sauce gives the duck a nice flavor and the meal is definitely something I recommend checking out, especially if you like duck.Throughout the meal, the service did not disappoint.  Baoding is definitely a go to Chinese spot in my mind!
Max's Allegheny Tavern=I really thought I'd never be back.  The goulash I had was so so gross.  But then,  was roped in by some friends who were doing a Sunday brunch book club.  Of course I couldn't miss out on tantalizing conversation... so I obliged.  I really had no clue what they offered for brunch options, but quickly learned they have a a pretty decent size brunch buffet.  I'm not below buffets at all, it's the fat kid in me!  Most things still looked a little questionable to me, but I went for the big ticket items.  Make your own omelets, potato pancakes and dessert.  I'd hit up the buffet again, but still be hasty to check out the regular menu again.  The omelet was made right in front of you, so I added cheese, mushrooms, peppers, tomatoes and onions.  I was super excited about it because it was the size of a football.  Sadly, it was pretty tasteless.  I don't think they added any salt or pepper to the egg mix, so it came out really bland, despite loading up on ingredients.  But the potato pancakes... I could survive on them forever.  They were amazeballs!  Add some sour cream and I was in potato patch heaven!  I had to keep myself from getting more because of the other thing I loaded up on... dessert.  The desserts looked unassuming, but they were also awesome.  I had a smattering of delectable bites.  The scones were so moist and tasty.  I had to stop myself from taking more than 20.  I also had some carrot cake, brownies, cookies among other things I inhaled and didn't pay attention too.  Should I be embarrassed?  Probably.  But I don't care because it was darn good!Our first stop in Pittsburgh, what a great start! Had a couple of yuenglings, a warm, salty yummy soft pretzel and a big ole plate of German goodness in da tummy!The Peasant Platter had knock wurst, weisswurst and a pork chop on top of heap of sauerkraut...with potato pancakes, spaetzel and a basket of baked breads!  So.much.food.  And oh soooo good!The bar is cool, staff is really nice and I believe they offer their patrons a free ride to and from on game days!
Europa Pastry Cafe=Hzappy Paczki Dzay Evzerzybodyzy!!!!So, if you're from one of the cities back east with a large Polish population (like Chicago), Paczkis are pretty much a staple for Fat Tuesday.  For those of you unfamiliar, it's pretty much a filled donut, but they're really good, and made even more special because you can only ever get them 1 day a year.  I was told on good authority that Europa is *the* place to go in the valley for real Polish fare, and it certainly didn't disappoint.  They had a whole case of authentic looking Polish baked things like Paczkis and Kolachkis and other things I can't spell or pronounce, but also have lots of Ks, Zs and Is in their names.  From what I saw, the paczkis they had were:  raspberry, prune, cherry & cream cheese, apple, custard, strawberry & probably a few more I'm forgetting. They also had a little Polish deli with more food I won't even attempt to spell, but it certainly seemed authentic.  Lots of sausages and meats and things.   Also, even the people that worked there were authentically Polish!  Well, I'm assuming so, at least.  They were white and spoke with accents I couldn't understand, but reminded me of the northwest side of Chicago.  Go forth and enjoy the fatty deliciousness that is the Paczki before you have to do the whole "Lent" thing, if that's the sort of thing you're into.  If not, enjoy it without having to do any of that pesky fasting.I put my body through hell and back.. some months Ill low carb others Ill eat WAY to much of everything.. the American yoyo diet I suppose. On the eve of my low carb madness I come to Europa to pick up a few goodies.The cheese and cherry coffee cake is the BEST Ive ever tasted! Moist flaky crust covered in cheese and canned cherries.. sheer delight and a real middle finger to the low carb diet! I feel so good and bad all at the same time.Only 4 because I do not have anything to compare to really? I had the stuffed cabbage, stuffed with ground turkey and spices, and the potato and cheese perogi's. They call it a small plate. LOL that stuff is filling. I think next time I will get two stuffed cabbages because they are the shit. The perogi's were great too. I am glad it was the small plate because it left just enough room for "Apple Slice" apparently it is a Polish version of apple pie. The top crust is more cake like with a glaze over the top. It totally hit the spot. The service is what you would expect from a family fun place .... Perfect and helpful.
Wong's Chinese Dining=i have ordered To-Go... alot! and ate in... i love it!! its a little red house.. you cant miss it... I'm pretty sure its family run... and its a cozy little place... the sweet and sour chicken/pork is great!! i always go for their lunch specials.. its no more than about $7 total... and you get a lot of food!! you get their soup ... then the entree! i always get their sweet and sour chicken or pork... a nice sized helping of egg fried rice.. chicken and bell peppers, big chunks of pineapple, onions in just the right amount of S&S sauce... a spring roll... its sooo good... and these little fried won tons.. so yummy... if you get take out.. you get all of it but the soup.. but that's alright :) when you get take out you always get more food stacked in the box :) yum! this is a great lunch spot down town :) its a hidden treasure...
Cherryblossom Noodle Cafe=Let's face Phoenix. If you say you'll never dine at a restaurant that exists in a strip mall, you're gonna be missing about 43% of Phoenix restaurants. Cherry Blossom, located in a deliciously skanky strip mall on Camelback is a true gem. Not a hidden gem, however, as I notice it's been yelped frequently and seems to be well received. I'll have to say I wasn't thrilled with my noodle dish, kinda bland. However, the sushi rolls were fantastic. The tempura shrimp in particular was mouth watering. My friends thai inspired soup was so good I almost wanted to dive in so I could simply lap it up with my tongue. But he hit me on my forehead with his spoon so I retreated back to my sushi rolls. Service was first rate. I had a manger meeting and we were there almost 2 1/2 hours and were never hurried and not once did we get the "waiter stink eye". If you've ever been privey to that, ouch, it stings! There were 7 of us and the bill came to about $100 so all I can is "come on down" cuz the "price is right" at CherryBlossom Noodle Cafe....Just got some to go action from the CherryBlossom peeps and I'm dripping in soy sauce as I type. YUM! Quick, attentive and friendly service! I can't wait to dive into my wasabi, my spicy tuna roll and my crunch roll. If you read this and I still have some left...ha ha...I might share with you. But, props to the staff for the sake while I was waiting...Strip malls in Phoenix shall not be ignored people!3.5 stars... Cherryblossom Noodle Cafe is a really good concept.  (It's a shame that Phoenix is lacking on options when it comes to Noodle Houses; Chicago, New York, and DC have noodles galore but we're not there yet I guess.)  Anyways, Cherryblossom has a welcoming ambiance and decent service too. I've been a few times, so I figured it would be the perfect place to stop for a late dinner last night after Urban Affair.  (It was Friday night around 9:30, so no problem getting in and seated right away).We sat at the bar and got drinks immediately.  Since the BF had already eaten a bunch of appetizers at the event we were at, he said he'd just share whatever I ordered.  So, I chose the miso eggplant appetizer and the Yaki Udon Noodle entree with tofu.  The eggplant dish was really tasty but they served it straight from the stove and we both burned our mouths taking the first bite.  We had to let it sit another few minutes to cool down enough to eat it.  (Note - I'm not complaining; I'd rather have my food served too hot than not hot enough... )  We finished the eggplant dish up right as the noodle dish arrived.  The noodles themselves were cooked just right but the dish had a weird flavor to it.  It just didn't taste right, or maybe it was just nothing special.  Either way, I would skip the Yaki Udon and go for something else on the menu when you go.Although I wouldn't rave about the food on my most recent visit to Cherryblossom, it was quick and cheap for a latenight dinner.  We were in and out in less than an hour and it was $20 out the door with tip - can't complain about that!  I'll be back!This was our first time at CherryBlossom. Hubby has needed to eat more vegetarian lately, so I've been on the lookout for new places with more options. The food was mostly great. Hubby enjoyed his tofu yakisoba, I liked my chicken katsu (although a couple of pieces were not quite done), loved my salad, liked the bread basket, and we both really enjoyed the crispy California roll. Dessert was also pretty good- we liked my flan better than his green tea mousse (which was not very sweet except for the almond flavored cream on top). Service was attentive in the beginning and then our waiter disappeared. I witnessed two other tables in our section grow confused and then annoyed as we waited... and waited... and waited for the waiter to return. One couple was even in mid-payment and finally went to the take out counter to inquire what was happening. I asked the busser to let the waited know we wanted our check. This disappearing act really took the shine off of an otherwise nice dinner. We'll likely return, however, to give CherryBlossom another chance.The only thing that prevents me from giving this place five stars is the inconsistency and slowness of the service. The place has a casual, relaxed atmosphere and the staff is friendly, but it often seems to take forever for the food to arrive, even when the restaurant isn't busy or crowded. I have nothing to complain about regarding the food itself - for me it has consistently been good, the servings ample, and the prices reasonable. And I do like the idea that they serve both Asian and Italian dishes, so that Cherry Blossom is a logical destination for me and my friends when we want to dine out but can't seem to decide on one cuisine to have for the evening. If only the service were a bit faster ...My friends and I ate here yesterday and I thought the food was good. They were pretty busy during the lunch hour, so we didn't get served right away. We also had to get our own menus because they were too busy. The restaurant itself has a nice array of Japanese noodles and sushi. Next time I will try their delightful tofu appetizers and healthy dinners. It was kinda weird seeing a basket full of bread and Melba toasts served with our noodle bowls though. I normally don't eat bread with Oriental noodles, but then my friend Michael mentioned that they also serve Italian pastas. I guess that make sense since it is a Noodle cafe. The decor inside is very Japanese. This eatery really complements the food with a light and comfy feel with their tables comfortably spaced apart. The price is definitely reasonable and really worth it.My friend John and I ate here this afternoon and we both had a pleasant experience. Our server Yuka recognized my friend John and gave him a hug. I guess John used to eat at Kirin Wok in downtown phoenix where she used to work. She said the place closed down, but the owners still works as food vendors at events and festivals as well as private catering. She was very attentive and gave us exceptional service. We started off with Tofu steaks with shitake mushrooms and vegetable tempura appetizers. Both were pretty good and then John got the Kitsune Udon Japanese Noodle for lunch and I ordered the Cappellini with tomato and garlic. Both were savory and delicious. I really like this place and I wish the other reviewers would try them more than once. They have amazing dishes, a relaxed atmosphere and offer great service with a smile.This is one of the places where I can say Japanese food has a little uniqueness to it. I like the whole Japanese Italian Cafe and Bakery look to it. It reminds me of the spin that the restaurants in Japan does too.I had the Tekka Don. Which was a sashimi rice bowl. It was good. Practically, it was a tuna roll not rolled up and put into a bowl. I used to get the Ika Mentai but that's becoming boring a bit.The atmosphere is nice but you can definitely expect a wait. For the love of everything delicious, don't go to one of those American chains pretending to be a Japanese restaurant. :cough cough: Ra Sushi.I find myself at CherryBlossom a lot nowadays, and that's why I needed to update my review. I've discovered my new favorite menu items, and they must be eaten! So, you should try:Spicy Gyoza PotCha-shu RamenTanTan-Men RamenUdon SukiThe gyoza pot is my favorite menu item (and it's on happy hour).  It's simple and delicious. I am completely satisfied with a Kirin and the gyoza pot for dinner. The Cha-shu is a damn good bowl of ramen, and the TanTan is even better if you're up for something spicy. My newest discovery, and the reason I needed to write this, is the Udon Suki. It consists of udon noodles, tofu, green onions, sliced beef, and a poached egg floating in a savory broth. CherryBlossom's Udon Suki is awesome, filling, and awesome.I have come to the realization that the service is hit or miss at this place, but in my opinion, the food makes up for any shortcomings. Go try some of the dishes I just mentioned and let me know what you think!I am not a big fan of Asian foods so finding a place that I can find something to eat on the menu while Dave enjoys all the sushi, udon, seafood he can eat in a meal is quite the daunting task.  Cherry Blossom is just the place we have been searching for.  I enjoyed some spicy ramen with chicken while Dave got to have sushi and seafood udon. Perusing the menu I found more than just the ramen that I am interested in trying.  This is definitely a place we can visit again and again.At last I've finally tried the beloved Cherry Blossom Cafe, and now I wonder what took me so long and when can I return! I asked for suggestions from my friends who are frequent customers, and everything came with rave reviews. In the mood for late night spice I chose the Tan-tan Men, a spicy noodle soup made with minced pork, delicious! Of course when offered more chili I dropped a spoonful or two in but only to add to the heat, the flavor was pure perfection! The prices were reasonable, the service was prompt and friendly and the menu offers so many choices, ramen, sushi, udon, miso, salads, and wait for it....Italian yes you read correctly bit unique but is that ever a bad thing..? Variety is the spice of life, when done well and Cherry Blossom has done just that and more!With this cool weather, I had a hankering for a bowl of hot ramen so to Cherryblossom I went.I decided to take advantage of the Happy Hour and got the Salmon Nigiri which came with 3 pieces and ordered the Hakata Ramen with an extra egg. The Salmon Nigiri was actually really good, soft and fresh tasting. The rice was a bit on the wet side so didn't keep it's form well under the Salmon. However, the flavor was there and tasted best with a touch of wasabi and a light dipping in soy sauce.The Hakata Ramen was pretty basic, I can tell they use powdered broth for their ramen as my tongue got a little bit funny feeling from the MSG. It comes with stick straight ramen, green onion, char-shu, wood-ear mushroom (ki- kurage) and my side order of egg- poached. The broth is Hakata style, made with pork bones and appears creamy, fatty and white in color. Though it is Hakata style, the flavors aren't complex as other ramen I've had and as I've stated was apparent they use a soup base mix/powder. The noodles were okay- though not always a fan of stick straight noodles, but the portion was just right. The char-shu was on the thicker side, but seasoned well. The egg, I wish was soft boiled instead of poached and lacked seasoning/flavor. Another thing that bugged me was that the ramen wasn't hot, it was warm ... perhaps sitting out in the pass a little too long?Over all I would come here for more Nigiri and pass on the ramen, the ramen is doable for the price point but nothing to get overly excited about. Thus far, their pasta and sushi seems the most promising here.The service is also pretty good as everything is friendly and quick!I love coming here during off peak hours, not to busy and our food came out pretty fast. The service was really good, we got Fumihiko as our server. He is the most nicest & polite server that I've had. One of my favorite food to eat here is the Katsu-don pork bowl. It's very delicious, they put egg on top, sliced scallions and when you scoop the rice from the bottom of the bowl, it's soak with some kind of a broth, it's really good!! We also ordered the Cha-shu ramen, the broth was good too and the BBQ pork was tender. They also serve bread and butter while waiting for your food.I like coming to CherryBlossom for the tan tan man Ramon.  It is a great price and I love the favor of it too.  Every time I come the service is great and they are alway really busy.  The restaurant is not all that big,  so when you get there you will probably have to wait 10 to 15 minutes.  I guess in a way this is one of my favorite places to come for Ramon.  It is in a small shopping center off of camelback and 9th street.Based on the great Yelp reviews, my boyfriend and I decided to try Cherryblossom Noodle Cafe, and we felt happy with our decision.Because other reviewers raved about the shrimp dumplings, the Korean spicy beef, and the cha she ramen, we decided to share them. Everything was yummy. My boyfriend REALLY liked the spicy beef, while I preferred the shrimp dumplings.The service and atmosphere were really nice, too.We will return to try other menu offerings soon!
Rustler's Rooste=You drive up and toss the keys to the valet while experiencing the heady mouth-watering aroma of cooking meat.Then as you walk up the trail to the front door your nose is assaulted with the other kind of meat: alive and pooping in a pen. Dang, that  bull had the biggest antlers I've ever seen - oh, like I know what  you call those pointy things. Upon entering you're offered a choice: stairs or slide. The 11 kids in our party uniformly opted for the slide. Over and over and over again. So did most of the moms. The 2 dads and one boyfriend all stuck with the stairs.The family style pork ribs were great. And can I have two of those delish Margies, rocks with salt, plskthx? Nummers.The establishment itself was gracious to the point of absurdity. We had a 5.30pm reservation for a party of 22. Due to bad traffic, getting lost, missing turns, and just general bad planning, half of us were 45 minutes late. On Valentine's Day, no less! And we were the early ones! The other half of us arrived another hour later. Half of those in our party were girls between the ages of 6 and 14 and no one batted an eye. (And yes, now you all know how pitiful my life is that I spent Valentine's Day with a giant group of kids.)The band was excellent. The dancing was fun to watch but I'd never participate due to my 17 left feet. The only thing I'd change were the gray mealy beans.Great place to greet then eat your meat.I can honestly say that I don't remember too much about the food, but the experience. Now that's a whole 'nother story. Picture this... I'm in Phoenix on a business trip at the Best Western HQ. So the owner of my company says that she heard about this restaurant that has a slide and she wants to try it out. Hmmm. A restaurant with a slide? Boss is paying. Hey, I'm coming, let me get my purse (for decoration only tonight). Well, after we driver to the end of the universe, we finally arrive. There are three in our party, including my crazy BGF co-worker. For those of you in the hotel biz, he's a night auditor, 'nuff said, you get the picture. Once we are seated (and the view is spectacular), we peruse the menu (oh, I ix nayed the slide. After seeing a heavy set lady with a dress on slide down and leave her booty juice.... again, nuff said). We looked over the menu and boss lady decides that we should try the fried rattlesnake and the Cowboy Platter. I'm game, remember, she's paying. Fried rattlesnake. What the he!! was I thinking? Must have been that quart sized drink I inhaled (remember, she's paying). Ok, what does it taste like? Popcorn chicken from KFC, over cooked. Again, nuff said. We're discussing the merits of Fried rattlesnake (that darn drink again) when we hear a commotion. Running across the restaurant like the kitchen is on fire, come 3 waiters. One has a triangle and is screaming at the top of their lungs. And the other two have this massive metal platter between them, held above their heads. They are all screaming and heading for us. I'm looking like an intoxicated (drink, boss, paying) deer in headlights as my auditory system catches up and sends the signal to my brain. "COWBOY SPECIAL, COWBOY SPECIAL, COWBOY SPECIAL" Oh great, now everyone in the restaurant is looking at our eclectic little group. My little Asian boss, dressed in flowers from head to toe with her $350 pumps, my BGF who is about 6"5, 400# and bald as an egg, and me, the fully intoxicated (Drink, Boss, Free) Korean American in her business suit. This platter had like 1/2 a cow, a chicken family and the 3 little pigs on it. I couldn't even begin to do it justice. It should have come with a warning. DO not eat for a week before ordering this special. Needless to say, I had an elephant bag to take with me after dinner (too much for a mere doggie). Oh and the piece de resistance? Why my boss convinced me (Booze. Free. Boss) that the free country line dancing on the patio for everyone to see would be just the thing. WRONG! No rhythm when I'm sober, so you know how this looked. Two left feet when I'm not drinking. You get the picture? One last time.....Drink. Free. Boss. "Nuff Said!I'm welcomed by Horny, the most pampered bull in the Valley with his diva-like attitude. I walk in the doors and I'm immediately offered two options to get to my table: the quick route -- the ever-so-popular slide -- or the boring way -- the stairs. The six year-old child in me screams "take the slide you coward!!" OK, what the hay right? After I've recovered, I walk through sawdust lined wooden floors on my way to my seat. During my journey, I pass by a live band playing on the stage, the energetic waitstaff teaching visitors how to two-step, a magician mystifying the crowd, a photo prop inviting me to be a plump cowgirl and stuffed rattlesnakes peering at me from their containers. You have just re-visited many, many of my nights throughout my life at Rustler's Rooste. Rustler's Rooste is a classic and a must-visit if you're in town vacationing, you want to throw a party or you simply want to make it a cowboy adventure of a night out on the town. I've been coming here since I could barely walk. As a child, I rarely left the slide area and would join the group of other children waiting in line to go up and down the slide the entire night while the grown-ups ate. Place a slide in a restaurant and it's endless hours of childhood fun. The food is good and hearty. From flavorful BBQ chicken to tender ribs to juicy steak, I never leave hungry. Oh did someone say rattlesnake? Well yes, yes they do happen to serve that southwestern delicacy, but only if you're really in the mood for an adventure. I normally stick with the basics. I've been to several events at Rustler's Rooste, including one of my favorites in the main ballroom equipped with long picnic tables and a stage for live music. Plus, the entire restaurant is situated on the rim of South Mountain and has spectacular views of the valley. Go during sunset. It's a romantic must. As if the night couldn't possibly get more fun, they now serve cotton candy to all the guests at the end of the meal. The child in me screams with happiness every time I enter Rustler's Rooste and the adult in me loves that this is one of the only remaining restaurants where you can walk in and receive the true southwest experience. And even though I live in AZ, I absolutely love it when I visit and receive the reminder from Rustler's Rooste just how authentic and special AZ is, especially with gems like Rustler's Rooste!Now the last time I was at The Rooste, I was bedazzled in pink Hello Kitty cowboy hat taking home first prize. I think it was some kind of yelp sticker lol! And that's when I got the full flavor of this meaty, enormous yet charming country restaurant/bar/event facility/iconic Phoenix restaurant. We yelpers devoured the buffet and downed some free beer. This time, a little different...Let the sawdust fly!Picture this. South Mountain. Covered in careening white mini vans and large American cars. Children. Everywhere. Like Children of the Corn. Octogenarians with walkers complete with two yellow tennis balls. Parents scrambling to keep their brood in order. Teenagers glued to their smart phones, completely unaware of the reason for this holiday. The stealing of land from the Native Americans. Yep. We Americans sure know when to party.Picture this. Me. My mom and my dad. Two of the cutest things I've ever seen. Walking. Slowly. Navigating the "rustic" entrance to the restaurant. It's like they're trying to imitate Tim Conway. Me? Patient. Oh so patient. You see, I was psyched to have my folks all to myself. No cooking. No cleaning. But would the food be gross? Cafeteria-like? And the worst, cold?No. No. And no.From our warm biscuits and Indian flat bread to our entrees (we all chose turkey with all the fixins)...it was a fantastic meal for $20 a  head. Our server was efficient and delightful. If I remembered her name I would publicly apologize for my father's flirting. Heck. Maybe she liked it! She mentioned she was working from 9am to 9pm. God Bless her. Hope she's wearing sensible shoes. They were helpful with extras (can you say "More gravy please?") and with boxing up to go treats. We skipped dessert as I was serving pumpkin pie, chocolate coffee cake and coffee at my place.The window booth we had (thanks dad for calling ahead) had those famous sweeping views of the valley, brown smog included. And of the large families swallowing the picnic tables outside below, chowing down and obviously having a good time. Other staff were energetic, friendly and helpful. I cannot imagine the pilgrims having a finer meal and a better time then me and my folks. Well, they did have those cute outfits. Not my folks. The pilgrims. Though mom was working her dangely Christmas tree earrings.Oh. The. Holidays.I was very excited because I had won a gift basket at La Noche de Yelp Elite Event in March for Rustler's Rooste and thought well my mom is coming from Washington for a visit in April why not take her there, it would be a 1st time for the both of us! Sounds like a great plan right!Mom came into town, I told her my plan of taking her out to eat, so Sunday came and we are ready to go!  Oh let me give you guys a little insight too, my mom had a stroke when she was in her 30's so walking is hard for her. We got to Rustler's Rooste around 4:25, I never bothered to looked at what times the place was opened, but found out they didn't open till 5, I dropped mom off at valet parking, and they were sweet and showed mom in through the exit so she didn't have to walk the steps. So when I parked the car, the valet told me where my mom went, for a slow walker, she sure did disappear fast , now it's about 4:35, one of the servers saw my mom and told her that when the place opens at 5 someone will seat us by the window if that would be ok with her, it was close to the exit and she was ok with that.Well 5pm came and nothing was happening, so I went up to the stairs and found the hostess and explained that my mom was handicapped and unable to walk up the stairs and where we were told we could wait to be seated, she said did you have reservations? I said no, again didn't think ahead, maybe I should I have, she said well, I have people upstairs that have been waiting for tables and left.   Walked back to mom and told her I didn't get very far.    From my impression from the hostess, only way I was going to get a table was if I walked upstairs to get it for us, and this left me with a bad impression, that maybe the RR isn't handicap friendly. Like only those who can get up the stairs can have tables, hurray for the walking!   My mom, who is more even tempered then me and is ok with just waiting, said just be still, so I waited. Another lady showed up about 6 mins later and asked if we had be helped and I said no we haven't, and she must have been someone important cuz she made it happened.   We were showed to our table, our waitress was Jennifer, very nice and very sweet, she explained the menu to us, since it was both our 1st time there we ordered the Cowboy Stuff, which was bbq ribs & chicken, crispy shrimp, steak & seafood kabobs, beans, veggies, potatoes wedges and some other stuff, I have to say the one thing that stood out was the ribs, omg they are fall off the bone melt in your mouth good! RR knows how to make some ribs! Going to have to come back from some more of them!I have to say Jennifer and the nice man at valet parking showed get customer service, but the hostess left me with a bad impression and she is where the dining experience starts.Let me start by saying, I wish there was an option for  a 1/4 star rating.Went here with another family during our "stay-cation" at a nearby resort. It was HORRIBLE! First, you can't miss the smell as you walk up to the place. I realized this is because of the Texas Longhorn right in front. Nothing like the smell of excrement and urine right before dinner. Second, the NOISE! This is a country western themed steakhouse, so whatever, be warned. Third, the service was the worst. Since we had a party of 8, an 18% gratuity is automatically added to our bill. That's fine, I get it, but apparently our waitress felt she didn't have to work for it since it's mandatory. She was rude and not very helpful...at all. I never experienced ordering a $20 appetizer (the fried rattlesnake) and having it thrown on our table, she didn't even stop! I was also looking forward to finishing our biscuits and fry bread, but apparently there's a time limit. She took them away without even asking. Fourth, the food was mediocre, at best. I ordered the 16oz T-Bone and it was under seasoned and not very good. The green bean and corn on the cob sides were soggy. At least try to hide the fact that it was over cooked and soaking in hot water before it was served. Fifth, when it came time to pay the bill, we were given the right check, but our credit card was charged for another party's dinner! Really???? We over-paid for a terrible experience! Finally, the General Manager wasn't very interested in our experience as paying customers, he said "it happens". SPEECHLESS! At least he was consistent with the rest of the night.We had better service, treatment, and food from McDonald's the next day.One of my fondest memories of growing up is eating at restaurants on my birthday. It was an occasion that conjured up the entire waitstaff, as they clapped their hands (and probably rolled their eyes), sang happy birthday, and delivered me a massive dessert adorned by a tiny glowing birthday candle. My twins just turned 5 and I wanted them to also have that delightful moment of abundant attention and sugar.  So, I started to look for places that would sing happy birthday.  Apparently, this is yet another thing to file in the "good old days" category.  Supposedly My Big Fat Greek Restaurant sings happy birthday in Greek...which sounds interesting, unless you are a 5 year old.Rustler's Rooste was suggested and it is true - they do sing happy birthday!  However, for a $15 price  tag.  But!  You also get a cowboy hat.I have to give them props for keeping the birthday spirit alive and well, even if it is no longer free.  The candle-lit dessert that arrives is enough to feed 3-4 people.  It is a football-sized eclair, oozing with whipped cream (my favorite food), and drizzled with chocolate (my second favorite food).As for the rest of the food....it is okay.  The meal starts with complimentary bread and butter and salad (ice berg lettuce, cucumber, a few cherry tomatoes and croutons).  I do appreciate getting food immediately, even if it is mostly iceberg lettuce and chewy bread.For the meal, I had the "catch of the day" which was ahi tuna.  It was well seasoned, but it could have been more pink.  I will say the exact same thing about my husband's steak.  The kids-meal portion of macaroni & cheese was terrifyingly huge; I think it was the largest portion size among the entire table.  I was relieved I opted to get steamed broccoli instead of french fries that came on the side.  But this may just not be the place you go for a fine-dining experience.  It is a place you go for a fun-dining experience.  There is a slide that all the kids love...and maybe some adults (*cough*) enjoy it as well.  There is also a big cow  that greets you at the entrance.  Does it emit a smell that I want to smell right before eating? Probably not.  But I will give it a few points for having such large, curly horns.A friend wanted to come here for his birthday. I tried to talk him out of it - but it *was* his birthday, and sometimes, it can be fun to be a hokey tourist in your own town.We had no delusions about what we were in for. This is not a great restaurant. This is a cheesy, cowboy themed resort restaurant that caters to tourists and happens to have a great view. To make sure we did it right, we changed clothes prior to going - to ensure we could enjoy the slide down into the dining room. (Without offending parents of innocent children or risking chafing to dangly bits.)We started with a cocktail in the bar while waiting for a table. Did we each order the sickly-sweet tropical nonsense in a glass cowboy boot and served while on fire? You bet your ass we did! (Now, to figure out what to do with my glass cowboy boot souvenir...)There's sawdust on the floor, and the décor screams "Disney Design Company." All the clichés of an old West steakhouse/saloon are represented - down to the raised stage where the live band performs all the safe, upbeat Country standards.When we were seated, a basket of fry bread was delivered with both regular and honey butter. Do you know what's wrong with fried bread and butter? Not a damn thing!This is not a menu for the health conscious. And based on the prices, there's no possible way it's great quality meat. ($24.95 for a bone in rib-eye - with salad, carrots and corn??) The portions are ginormous, there's a decent variety of options, and rotating monthly specials.I had discreetly mentioned it was my friend's birthday (because I put the "B" in subtle!) I wasn't down with spending the extra money for the birthday package...and really, who needs an éclair sundae that must weigh in at five pounds - so we were both pleased when the waiter brought my friend cotton candy with a candle.We went in with expectations of touristy cheesiness and set the bar very, very low for dinner service. And we were both pleasantly surprised. The food was completely satisfactory. The service was completely decent. And when it came down to it - we had an absolute blast.Rustler's Rooste is not a great restaurant by any stretch, and it's not trying to be - but it can be great fun if you let it...and that makes it a great place!
The Great Dane Restaurant=A cheesedog and chili dog, just good enough to fill an empty stomach. Somehow it was just average but definitely good stuff.
Moto Sushi=Mutt-friendly microbrews - oh yea.Hiking with Jaek recently one evening was culminated wonderfully with a tasty ale on their shaded patio.Sure it was warm, but we were together - a boy and his dog and his beer.Beautiful, man, beautiful.I hate to be an asshole, but I hated this place. I came here yesterday with a group of friends for lunch. Our 15 minute wait turned into what felt like an hour, when impatient me finally went in to see what the deal was... To my surprise, there was an empty table for a party of 7 that was just sitting there. Are you kidding me? So I ask one of the servers if its cool that we snag it, to which he said Yes. Just cram in tight. NO big deal. So I go and grab my friends to alert them that the table was ready, and when I walk back in, some stupid little bitchy server is standing there glaring at me telling me she "needs a minute to move the table" while huffing and puffing and sighing and just generally being a little queen about having to move a freakin table. I'm sorry, isn't it your JOB to accommodate patrons? I thanked her as she stormed off, and say something shitty to her about being such an inconvenience. I never saw her again throughout the duration of my visit. Star removal #1.We all sit down, and continue waiting for our drink order to be placed. Finally, after about 10 minutes, this happens, but were without menus, so no one *really* knows what they want, Waitress huffs, rolls her eyes, and goes to grab menus. We look, she takes our order, but only for about 6 of the 8 people at the table. She somehow forgot about the tallest man at the table and the girl sitting across from him. Once she comes back, after 3 attempts, she gets the order wrong, serves me my sake without a cup or a glass for my beer. Seriously?Star removal #2.We finally order. Mind you, this was the longest lunch in the universe, because at this point we had already been there for an hour. Luckily our waitress got the order correct, except a few of us ended up waiting at least 45 minutes for our rolls to come out.. specifically the Avocado rolls.. did you run to California to grow and pick them yourself because.. wow. Star removal #3.They managed to Eff up the most important part, which was the SUSHI. My unagi was not fresh, the spicy tuna tasted like plastic, they only had smoked salmon, no raw. They waitress *highly* recommended the dessert roll, which was ice cream rolled in rice krispys.. I know that sounds awesome and all, but im here for sushi, not ice cream. Also, on the menus, it says they have the choice to put a grat on ANY size party.. this to me is absolutely absurd.Star Removal #4I'm sorry, but when you see a PARTY OF EIGHT slide in, you do everything in your power to make these people happy, because if you don't, you can expect that "We can grat anyone we want" to be the only grat you get. Nothing additonal.Get your shit together Moto, and maybe remind your waitstaff that their JOB is to make sure your patrons enjoy themselves, not make us feel like a burden. If it weren't for them, this review wouldn't have been so shitty.P.S. Start to finish, lunch took 2.5 hours. FAIL.The people who regularly patronize Moto must not have jobs, or lives, or children, or pets, because if they did, they would constantly be late to everything they did, have a pissed off babysitter, and dead animals littering their house.I am extremely understanding and very forgiving, but when it takes over 45 minutes to bring me avocado rolls, when it really isn't busy, there is something way wrong. Like wayyyy wrong.I had the miso soup. Didn't like it. Once I finally got the avocado rolls, they were really good, but I was so annoyed that I could barely enjoy them. I also had to ask several times to get my tea refilled.The location is good, my sushi was good and reasonably priced, and the decor is pretty cool, so I am going to give them three stars, but the service was so terribly slow I feel like being served by a sloth would have been more efficient.I really enjoy Moto's Happy Hour. What makes it great is you can get non-sushi items at Happy Hour in addition to sushi. This is a good compromise when you are going with someone who isn't wild about sushi. They do only offer 4 rolls during the Happy (Kalifornia, Tootsie, Philadelphia and Spicy Tuna) but all four are fresh and delicious. We also tried the asian nachos which we both thought were amazing! They are made with friend wontons some kind of spicy cheese, chicken and avocado. (I'm sure there was more on it but we ate it so fast there wasn't time for much research.) You can't beat the Happy hour prices!  For 2 people we had a total of 3 beers, 3 orders of sushi and a small asian nacho and it came to $24. One big improvement over last time was the service was much faster. This place is good for dinner and the AYCE Sushi on Saturdays, but for a first timer I would really recommend the Happy Hour over anything else.All you can eat limited sushi on Saturday for around $20. Sold. I crashed Dottsy Z's  party with two other lovely ladies (Hi Amber and Debi) this past Saturday after literally stepping off of a plane and seeing her post that she was here. The funny thing was that I wasn't really hungry, until I saw all the yummy food in front of me. Eel rolls, Las Vegas rolls, Toosie Maki Rolls, Spicy Tuna Rolls, good lawd I was in heaven. I ate so much that I arrived looking "skinny" and I left looking as if I was expecting a baby sometime in the very near future lol. Sad case yes. Our waitress was extremely nice but a little overworked since it appeared as if she was working the entire restaurant solo. So if you are hankering for some sushi, go on a Saturday over to Moto Sushi. But be warned, you must eat everything that you order if you order off the all you can eat, or you will be charged 50 cents per piece that you leave on your plate. So don't overdo it. (We left nada! lol)I have held off writing a review for Moto for a year or so.  Sadly I have been subject to dining here multiple times, because I am sucker for 'second chances...and third and fourth'...Moto joined the North Central scene years ago, and sadly has gone down hill.  The only thing helping it stay afloat is the lack of other sushi restaurants in the area for the citizens of the neighborhood to enjoy.  The service is pitiful, and it seems like they hire anyone that inquires.  Dining at Moto takes over an hour and a half, with just 3 people.  Getting water upon arrival is painful and receiving the exact food you ordered, is not an option.   Whatever you do...don't come to dine if you have any food allergy. The bartenders are always eating and licking their fingers, touching their hair and then touching everything "sanitary" behind the bar.  The drinks made and ready to go to their respectful customers, just sit at the bar back and begin to water down for easily 10 mins before the floor server magically reappears from the kitchen.The food isnt even good!  Sushi is sloppy, not creative, and poor cuts of fish.  The ALL YOU CAN EAT SUSHI...well, they bank on their horrible service to never bring you the goods as you request and are ready.  We sat in front of empty plates for 35 mins at one point.Twice now, when we were ready to leave, the server is no where to be found (just the same as most of the meal).  I was literally trying to give them money and they would avoid all eye contact and assistance. *que bad SNL skit from the 80s.... Please, do yourself a favor, and do not dine here....and WHATEVER you do...dont take anyone here for dinner, you will embarrass yourself.
Alla Famiglia=FACT: Thee best Italian meal I've had in the Burgh, hands down!FACT: I ate so much I thought they would have to wheel me out on a stretcher.FACT: It's a serious hidden gem in a slightly sketchy neighborhood.Need some more info, because I'm comin' atcha with the goods! To start they set the table with "Holy Oil," which is banana pepper olive oil for dipping Italian bread in, a seasoned cecci bean and cheese gustoso and a goat cheese and olive spread. I wish they sold that banana pepper olive oil because I wanted to have it every day of my life! We ordered the famous Meatball appetizer. This meatball is for serious! It's massive and stuffed with mozzarella cheese. Yep, I'm for realz. It was just oozing Italian sexiness, in a ball. As soon as I tasted the red sauce, it tasted like my Grandma's, which sparked fond memories and made me want to actually live in this place. We also ordered the Trifolata, which is assorted mushrooms and currants in marsala cream. It was also incredible. The bad/good of it was that it wasn't really needed because they give you so much food, but it was delicious, so whatever!For the Third course they serve you your choice of pasta either with their famous home made vodka sauce or fettucini. But here's the thing, the fettucini is made in front of you... in a cheese wheel. Yep, I'm for realz again! I know I'm crazy for not ordering it, but I really love me some vodka sauce and was incredibly happy with this amazing homemade sauce. My hubby got the fetticini and loved it. See, we're all happy here!Fourth course is a salad with red vinagariette, roasted red peppers, candied walnuts, golden raisens and gargonzola cheese. It wasn't memorable amongst all the bangin' dishes but not too shabby at all.For the Fifth course (and when I finally tapped out) I ordered the Cioppino with shrimp, mussels, clams, scallops and fish in a saffron and tomato broth with sambuca. It matched all the other dishes. Just incredible. Loved the broth, loved the succulent scallop (just one, but I can't complain, I was stuffed by that point!), the shrimp was jumbo and the fish was perfectly cooked. And the garlic bread was excellent.Whenever anyone says things are expensive, I usually think they're talking $30 a plate. But, this place is legit expensive. Think $50 (ish) a plate. But what I can tell you is it was 100% worth it! We had leftovers for two days! Talk about an Italian hospitality. Which, by the way, the service was exceptional, but I would have expected that here. A perfect special night out, if you don't mind unbuckling a couple notches in front of your dining companion, of course!I had been wanting to come here for a very long time.  I finally ate here this past Saturday and it was awesome.  Now I can't wait to come back!First, I urge you to make a reservation because every single table was filled while we were there, and for good reason--the food is AWESOME.  The food is so good you aren't even going to feel guilty about the calories you have consumed--because you will eat A LOT OF THEM.The second thing you need to know is to show up HUNGRY.  Don't eat all day.  If possible, do what I did and work out earlier in the day, because you will leave this restaurant WELL FED.  To quote one of the great artists of our time, Ice Cube, "Life ain't a track meet, its a marathon!"It is a marathon.  They're going to bring you out delicious warm bread as soon as you sit down, and supply you with heavenly toppings for it, including the famous Holy Oil that is truly divine.  Temperance is a virtue.  Don't be like me and commit a sin against your entree by eating it when you are STUFFED, and can't fully enjoy it. because like a fool you couldn't restrain yourself with the bread bc carbs turn you into AN ANIMAL and you didn't pace yourself.You'll get all the bread you can handle.  Our waiter John, who was super nice and attentive, suggested we order the meatball appetizer and he was right.  Its huge, its literally the size of a softball and comes out wrapped in cheese, in a heavenly marinara sauce, served with love.  It was extremely good.  Then you get the salad course, which comes in a home made vinagrette which is also delicious.  Then comes the pasta course,  We had fusilli pasta in vodka sauce which was very good but at this point I was basically full and tapping out.  I ended up eating not even 1/4 of my pasta, but then the waiter offered to bag it up for me, so I had lunch for the next day.Your entree comes out after the pasta course, and you're going to be already stuffed at this point. Now, I took my friend here for his birthday.  I think they key is to come here when you are not paying, bc my bank account was crying when I saw the entrees start at $40.  More on that in a moment.I ordered the filet and it was SPECTACULAR.  I mean, amazing.  So good I did not share, and after I ate it, I fondly reflected on the time my filet and I spent together.  Temporarily in my mouth, forever in my heart.  Or on my hips.  It was not diet food, it was covered in some sort of heavenly cream cheese sauce that is the stuff dreams are made of.  It was a $60 dinner and it tasted like one too.  My friend ordered the blackened sea bass and it came out looking like a work of art.  Both our dishes were basically food porn.  He loved his dinner too and said that his fish came out topped with large chunks of crab and he loved it.We were waayyy too full to even think about dessert.  I'm sure the desserts would have been divine but we just could not do it.  In fact I ended up taking half my filet home with me.This place is technically expensive, but if you think about it, it's really not that bad.  Our bill came to $200 for the two of us, but for what you get, it's really a pretty damn good deal.  You get top notch service, the restaurant itself is beautiful, and the food is absolutely incredible.  This was probably the best meal I have had in Pittsburgh.  Oh--and you get enough food that you get a full meal the next day. I cannot believe that I had not been here before, and I will absolutely be back.
Phoenix House Of Pizza And Subs=This is definitely the place to get cheap eats on the fly!The Need: a good lunch close to my work - hopefully one that I had not been to yet.The Restriction: $7 in singles to my nameThe Rescue:  I reached out to the Phx Yelp community on the talk boards for help with my lunch conundrum and Amanda B. came to the rescue.The Verdict:  I've seen Phoenix House of Pizza and Subs many, many times driving near my work.  Honestly, I always thought it was some sort of front for illegal activities or a place where kidnapped children were kept.  The outside isn't very appealing and the surrounding establishments in the strip mall are a little sketchy and unkempt looking.  So, by association, it wasn't on my list of places to check out anytime soon.I took a co-worker/witness with me (remember...strength in numbers) and headed to get a slice or two.  Inside was very different from the outside perception.  It is a huge space with a lot of dining tables and is very clean minus a few uncleared tables.  We each ordered two big slices - him sausage and me pepperoni, green pepper, and pineapple.  Yum!  It was cooked to order (although a tiny bit burnt) and nice and hot.  You won't find pizza that has sat under the lamps for hours on end.  There are a variety of condiments (red pepper flakes, parmesean, etc.) and they also have a few desserts.  I haven't ventured to the sub side yet - maybe next time.  What's even better?  My two custom pie slices rang in at just under $7.  Oh yeah!So, I didn't witness any illegal activities or see any kidnapped children, but I did manage to have some good eats within my budget and walking distance from my work.  Check it out if you're on a budget and in the area.
Cheeseburger in Paradise=If I could give NO stars this would be the place that deserves it.  We were in on a Thursday night at around 7pm.  There were a handful of patrons(certainly more staff than paying customers).  There was one bartender who was bothered to make drinks.  We watched him make a moijto and when he poured from the shaker to the glass he spilled some over including a lime and some mint that went onto the bar, he picked them up and put them back into the cup.  DISGUSTING! Then the 4 of us at the bar were ready to order another round and the bartender went MIA, we waved down 2 waitresses who went into the back and we never saw them again, 10 minutes later he came back and when asked "what happened to you", he responded, "I am busy, I need to clean the keg lines." Don't waste you time here!
Filiberto's Mexican Food Restaurant=OK. I can't believe I've kept this secret for so long. I can't believe I'm about to walk out of yet another closet. But if I can help just one person...Yes. I crave. On occassion. Ok, like weekly. Filiberto's carnitas tacos. That's all I've ever had from here. Always drive thru. God forbid any of my foodie friends from yelp or chowhound see me. Two perfect little corn tortillas, filled with tender and juicy pork with a few crispy edges, cilantro and pico de gallo. Ole. I eat them in my car. With a measure of guilt and shame. But it just it makes it more exhilirating. And tastey. Ahhhh...a weight has been lifted!
Armadillo Grill=After sneaking in to the Biltmore to use their hot tub for 2 hours, we needed a place to grab some food and a drink or two. Of course, it was more for me that we needed a dive-y sort of place as I had no makeup and a baseball hat covering my wet hair. Nico recommended Armadillo's and I was a fan right away. We sat at the bar and the bartender was friendly and prompt with our drinks. We ordered: *Wings in Armadillo Gold Sauce- Nico loved them *Potato Skins- soooo good! Some of the best skins I've ever had *Hummus and Pita bread- also v good. Pita was warm and toasted perfectly There were a lot of sports fans glued to the Chargers game and it was a fun atmosphere.  Definatly a place to stop in for cheap food and drinks, with or without looking like a complete scrub.
Island Grocery=Nice caribbean grocer on the east side, I found some great curry powders and other items for a recipe.  I also tried the food since it was around lunch-I tried the curry chicken with cabbage and rice ...it was just ok so I'll stick to buying their curry powder for now.
Casbah=Um.  A little bummed.  I had high expectations, but left feeling just...meh.The restaurant is really cool looking but I was a little confused by the bar set up.  We sat at the bar because they didn't have any tables open.  I usually don't mind sitting at the bar but the stools are bolted to the floor, and about 2 feet from each other.  If you have three people with you, forget about mingling!  Also, the service was very iffy.  There was a bartender, and then a server for the bar area (or what it seemed like).  The bartender got us our drinks, but never told us a server would be with us.  I figured she was our server too.  But then some other woman came up to us all flustered.  She never introduced herself, just asked what we wanted and kept saying "okay, okay, okay."  Just very odd.  It continued that way the entire time.I tried the prix fixed brunch for $24, which includes your choice of an alcoholic bevvie (Bloody Mary, Sangria or Mimosa), appetizer and main course.  I had the mimosa, that was the perfect mix (splash of OJ:), Polenta and Eggs Beni.  The cinnamon polenta, which was delish: light, fluffy and warm with dried fruit and almonds on top.  I loved it!The Eggs Beni with smoked salmon.  It was just okay.  I kept trying to think pf what was missing and I believe it was that the hollandaise sauce had no real taste.  I expect hollandaise sauce to be rich and creamy, this was thin and blah.  I definitely want to go back and try the dinner, see if maybe I'll have a little better luck.  So kick it up a notch Casbah, you've been around for a while, but I still expect good food!One year since my first venture to Casbah, I had the chance to return for a second time. And I have to say that I am officially a die-hard Casbah fan.Yes, our dinner group quickly racked up a big bill - but it was for a birthday party, and Casbah had kindly sent along a $30 off dinner coupon beforehand. Even better, they went ahead and applied the discount even though we managed to forget to bring the actual card they had sent ahead to us. We had been completely prepared when asking about this to potentially not be able to use that $30 off at our visit, so their understanding alone would have gone a long way in making the meal a good one.The amazing food just sealed the deal. Between a table of four we all had the chance to order and then a variety of Casbah's current menu - including their scallops, arugula salad, duck, pork and veal meatballs, and a ricotta very similar to what I had ordered the last time I visited. Everything was stupendously delicious - I honestly have no other words for how good this food was - and we all left full and satisfied with no complaints.Casbah has definitely become a restaurant that I can come to for special events. Their food and service impressed me again tonight even more than they did last time; add in the fact that they use local ingredients whenever possible and always have something new to try with the changing seasons, and I'm completely sold. Here's to the next special occasion and dinner out at Casbah!Upon receipt of the much-coveted Big Burrito birthday voucher, I had to make the tough decision about which of their restaurants to visit.  I was torn between Casbah and Eleven, but upon perusing the menus, reading reviews, and giving the matter much thought, I settled on Casbah.  I knew I'd made a good decision when I invited some friends to join me, and they said that, based on their past experience, I'd made an excellent choice!Our meal started off with a few slices of bread, which came with butter and a Greek yogurt spread.  The butter was good, but the yogurt spread was amazing, and both of them dressed up the bread very well.  We then ordered an appetizer of the bruschetta, which was not your normal bruschetta, but was delicious.  I'm not entirely sure of the ingredients, since what we received doesn't match the menu description posted on the website, but one notable thing about it was that it had some pomegranate seeds that gave it a subtle sweetness and juiciness, complementing the other savory ingredients.  For my entree, I ordered the orecchiette, a dish consisting of ear-shaped pasta tossed in a goat cheese and sage cream sauce, with chicken and dried cranberries.  Flavorwise, this was one of the most well-balanced dishes I've ever eaten, with the savory ingredients and sweet hints from the cranberries (which were actual cranberries, rather than craisins, as I'd imagined) melding together in perfect culinary harmony.  The pasta was also cooked to a perfect al dente firmness, which held up well in the microwave several days later when I ate the leftovers.  The cranberry-lime dry soda that I ordered to go with this entree complemented it very nicely, and was a great alternative to wine (while I was tempted, I didn't order any since my dining companions decided not to, due to having driven).My two dining companions ordered the Scottish salmon and the gnocchi, respectively.  Based on the samples that they provided me, Casbah did a great job on these dishes, as well!  The salmon had a subtle saltiness that complemented the flavor nicely, without overpowering it.  My friend who ordered it had had it before at Casbah, but had since been to Scotland, and he said that it was very similar in quality and taste to the versions of this dish that he'd tried there.  The gnocchi was one of the most unique and varied dishes I've encountered, and, based on the two bites that I tried, brought the ingredients together in a medley of flavors and textures.  I think my friend who ordered it described it best by saying that every bite was a bit different, but that they were all delicious!  Although all of us tried bites of each other's dishes, we each liked our own choice best, so we chose well.After our entrees, we decided to order dessert.  Although I was tempted by the dark chocolate raspberry bread pudding, since many reviewers speak highly of it, I decided to follow my instinct and get the chocolate-hazelnut bomba.  I'm so glad that I did, since this dessert was amazing!  If you like dark chocolatey, torte-like desserts or Nutella, this dessert is a must-try. Since I mentioned I was at Casbah for a birthday dinner, the dessert was served with "Happy birthday" written on the plate in chocolate icing, which was a nice touch.  My dining partners ordered the creme brulee to split between themselves, which came topped with an apple compote.  Based on the bite that I tried, it was a good rendition of a brulee, but couldn't match the star power of the chocolate bomba.We visited at 7:30pm last Sun., at the later end of their serving hours, but service from our waiter, Brian, was very good.  We were seated in the tent-like area in the front of the restaurant, which stayed surprisingly warm during most of our visit.  At one point before dessert, upon returning from the restroom, I noticed that it'd cooled off, but the manager came out to turn on the heating elements, and it warmed back up in less than 10 min.In sum, if you're looking for a solid fine dining experience with innovative, delicious food, Casbah is a great choice.  The food was impressive in its quality, and the service was what I've come to expect at a higher-end restaurant.  I'd particularly recommend getting on the Big Burrito mailing list to receive a $30 birthday voucher and $10 off coupons for the holidays, and taking advantage of one of these occasions to try it.  I'm certain that you'll be as pleased with your experience there as me and my dining partners!It is DUE time to update this review. Why? Because I had a phenomenal brunch here, and it totally restored my faith in not only Casbah, but Big Burrito. I can't lie, I love what the Big Burrito group does. I think all their restaurants are awesome, but Casbah was always my least favorite. Now, I feel it is on par with the others!I love a good prix fixe brunch, and for $28 you receive a cocktail, appetizer and entree. So I started off with a mimosa (always a good start!). Then I ordered the Tomato & Basil Bisque and parmesan crostini, which was excellent. I'm very judgmental of tomato bisque, as it is one of my favorite soups. Then came the main course. Braised Lamb & Eggs: braised Elysian Fields Farm lamb shoulder, spinach, poached local eggs, tarragon, grilled sourdough. I love lamb so hard. It's by far my favorite meat, but it has to be cooked with care. This definitely had flavor, was tender and paired perfectly with the spinach and eggs. I couldn't finish my meal, so they boxed it up. I separated the sourdough and the rest of the dish so the bread wouldn't get soggy, and our server gave it to me without the sourdough. I mentioned I did that on purpose and he immediately went back into the kitchen and got me fresh bread. How nice is that?Now I'm excited to try other meals here again!I got my Big Burrito birthday meal voucher in the mail, and I couldn't decide which place to try.  I am a huge fan of Eleven and Mad Mex, but I wanted to try somewhere new.  I had previously sampled Casbah's food when they catered the dinner for Quantum Theater's production of Tamara.  I enjoyed the food at that event so I settled on coming here.The atmosphere of Casbah is really cute.  It's slightly upscale, but you will still feel comfortable in nice jeans.  There is a Mediterranean theme to the atmosphere, but I don't know that the food is themed that way, despite what Yelp says.I ordered the Lamb Macaroni and Cheese because I am a Mac and Cheese addict.  The portion was exactly lunch sized, and it came with a small salad.  The salad was really just a spring mix of lettuce with an oil dressing, but it tasted good.  The mac and cheese was delicious.  Plenty of lamb and lots of cheese.  It was on the creamy side of the mac and cheese scale.  I would order it again, but I would also like to try other things on the menu.  My friends ordered a sandwich and one ordered a bowl of soup.  The sandwich eater felt her turkey sandwich was pretty standard, but it was a turkey sandwich.  The soup eater was a fan.  Again, I plan to come back and test other things.As a side note: The catered meal I previously tried was family-style chicken with potatoes and veggies, I believe.  It was good but not what I would expect after seeing the menu for them to serve.  I think you are safe to try just about anything here, really.The only odd thing was that the servers really seemed to be fighting for tables.  Everyone was trying to get our drink and food orders, to the point of it being a touch aggressive.  Not a big deal just an observation.We went to Casbah this past Saturday.   It is my birthday month and Big Burrito offers a great deal for anyone who is on their mailing list, providing their patrons with a free entrée up to $30.00 at any of their locations beside Umi.  I chose Casbah since I have been to all of them but this one.Our reservations were early at 5pm on a Sunday.  We arrived seated quickly in their outside seating area, which is very nice.  We were brought some water while we reviewed the menu.  I decided to start with a Manhattan to drink.  It was very nice, and strong.  Next we decided to order.  Earlier I looked online at their menu and I decided I would be ordering either the Cioppino, littleneck clams, mussels, shrimp, scallops, halibut, grilled sourdough -32 or their Long Island Duck, roasted breast, braised leg, gnocchi, spinach, lavender, peaches, duck jus- 29.  I have had the duck dish at Soba before and loved it, but I wanted to try the Cioppino despite that, since I also love seafood and shellfish.  This I would discover was a mistake.  My partner got the Pork Chop dinner.  We placed our orders and waited.During our wait they brought some bread.  It was a nice touch; the bread was warm and served with two types of spreads.  By the time our entrées came I wanted another drink and asked for Boyd and Basil - 10 Boyd & Blair vodka, fresh lemon, basil, soda, Angostura bitters, this was one of their signature cocktails.  So we began to eat.  The scallops in the dish were excellent.  Perfect sear and seasoned, as well as the shrimp.  The tiny piece of halibut in the dish and I mean tiny, was so overcooked.  I choked it down but completely unappealing and tiny.  The sauce in this fish soup was also not that great.  The dish came with bread to soak up the juices but the bread itself was burnt and hard.  It actually hurt my mouth to bite it and that was after dipping it in the juices.  I was going to ask for more bread, hold the burn, but our server had not come back.  So I finished the meal and said forget it.  At this point the drink I ordered was still not delivered.  I was done eating and had to use the restroom so I told my husband if he came back without my drink to tell him forget it and just bring the check.  When I got back to the table that was indeed what happened.  Except he told him he was sorry and if we ordered dessert he would comp my drink.  So when he finally returned, he ordered the Chocolate Cheese Cake Bombe, Pinotage syrup & whipped cream, hazelnuts, praline ice cream, gastrique, when the waiter asked me I simply said no thank you, can I just have the drink I ordered?  He brought dessert and my drink and explained it was "on the house, and it was their/his fault."  No biggy really, I was way more annoyed with my meal.  I think what really bothered me was one, how small the entrée was.  It was more suited to be a lunch portion in my opinion.  And then how much it was, but I did have the coupon so I guess I can't complain that much about that.  Simply put if I had spent $32.00 on the meal I got I would have been very upset.  Lastly, the halibut was so overcooked and dry, same with the toast, and the sauce wasn't that pleasant.  All in all I wish I would have gone with the duck.  Live and learn.
Alexander's Italian Bistro=I AM BOYCOTTING ALEXANDER'S FOR LIFE!!! The manager SCREAMED AT ME at the top of his lungs in an epic meltdown that lasted 10 minutes! On Sat., April 12, 2014, I attended the 50th birthday party for my dear friend, David Flynn. I organized the party, but relied on Dave and his sister to provide me with the final head count. I made the reservation for 25 people.The manager and I played phone tag for the two days before the event. I called back and left messages TWICE to confirm, but apparently he never got my messages. (This was part of his rant, his indignation at unreturned phone calls that actually HAD been returned!)The dinner started at 7 PM. Most of our group arrived on time, but some of our group (including me) arrived between 8 PM-9 PM. I was working on a homemade birthday present for Dave, which took longer than expected. I called Dave, his sister and my friends (Reesa & Joel) to tell them I was running late. In hindsight, I should have also called the restaurant to let them know, and for that I am truly sorry. That still doesn't justify the manager SCREAMING AT ME FOR 10 MINUTES!After enjoying a delicious dinner, drinks and birthday cake, none of us had a clue that anything was wrong. If the decision to return to a restaurant were based SOLELY on the food and wait staff, I would definitely return to Alexander's. But sadly, when the manager has a nuclear meltdown and throws a 10-MINUTE SCREAMING TEMPER TANTRUM, it tends to sour one on returning to a restaurant.Towards the end of our dinner, some of us started to smell cigarette smoke, which we later realized was coming from the patio out front. (It was a warm night, and they had the front sliding-glass doors open.) In the midst of the smoke discussion, the manager approached our table and began an EPIC RANT, SCREAMING AT ME FOR 10 MINUTES!!!He was angry that everyone in our group hadn't arrived at exactly 7 PM. The restaurant's kitchen is open till 10 PM on Sat. night, so I don't understand why this was a big deal. We ended up with 20 people total and 5 no-shows. I am always disappointed by no-shows, but I explained this possibility to the manager when I made the reservation. I STILL BROUGHT HIM 20 PAYING CUSTOMERS! BTW...the dining room was practically EMPTY, which is not what I would expect on a Saturday night in Pittsburgh. Maybe I'm not the first customer to be on the receiving end of the manager's meltdown.The manager SCREAMED that he had called me twice, and I hadn't called him back! He ranted about this about a dozen times. I told him I HAD called him back - TWICE. It's not my fault if he didn't get my messages. He SCREAMED that he had put an extra waitress and cook on staff because he expected 25 people. He SCREAMED that I had cost the restaurant $100! How much money do you think 20 people spent on appetizers, dinner and drinks? I find it hard to believe that they didn't make any money, or at least break even. I am sorry that there were 5 no-shows in our group, but I always thought Saturday night was the busiest night of the week for most restaurants. I didn't realize the restaurant would look like a deserted, old western ghost town with hardly any customers. On a Saturday night, I assumed they would have a full staff on duty with or without my reservation. I was wrong. I'm sorry. I'm not perfect.The manager also YELLED at me and my friends for "LOOKING COMFORTABLE" in his restaurant!!! Since when is looking comfortable an OFFENSE??? I thought restaurants wanted you to feel comfortable, but apparently not at Alexander's.He also SCREAMED that one of the waitresses only got a $1.00 tip! I found that hard to believe, but just in case he wasn't making it up, I tipped my waitress $35 on my $26 dinner check! I am a former waitress, and I would feel HORRIBLE if any waitress every got ripped off on my watch! Even if his story wasn't true, I figured she deserved an extra big tip just for having to WORK in such a horrible place where the manager YELLS at paying customers!!! If he treats the customers this way, I can only imagine how he treats the employees. THE MANAGER'S RUDE BEHAVIOR HAS COST HIM MY BUSINESS AND MY FRIENDS' BUSINESS FOREVER!!! During his rant, he actually SCREAMED that he never wanted to see me in his restaurant ever again! I'm happy to grant him that wish. And so are my friends. This is an example of the WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE I have ever witnessed in my entire life!!! I thought the manager was going to have a heart attack or a stroke the way he was SCREAMING FOR 10 MINUTES!SCREAMING at paying customers is completely unacceptable behavior, and I will NEVER eat at Alexander's ever again. It's really a shame because I loved their salmon with pesto sauce. But great food can't make up for a manager who throws a TEMPER TANTRUM and SCREAMS AT YOU. Also, you can smell smoke in the dining room, which sucks. My friends and I are BOYCOTTING ALEXANDER'S FOR LIFE!!!
Bamboo House=Bamboo House is conveniently located on the Northwest corner of Thunderbird and 7th Street just at the foot of North Mountain.  The parking is adequate and well lit.  Access to the place is easy.Their menu is a pleasant mix of traditional Chinese food, fresh new dishes and some other Asian favorites with their own twist.  They have an good sized menu, plenty of varied choices, but not so big that you can't decide.  Their delicious lunch specials are served until mid afternoon and include egg roll, crab rangoon and a cup of soup.One of my absolute faves is their pad thai.  It has just the right amount of spicy for me, although they are happy to dial it up or down for your tastes.  They serve a dinner portion as well as a lunch portion.  The lunch special is enough for 2.... the dinner portion is enough for 2 and you can still take a doggie bag. The only noticeable difference between the lunch and dinner portion of pad thai is that they dinner portion has has shrimp as well as tofu and chicken.Other favorites of mine include their lemongrass chicken.  It has a delicious flavor and is made with the best white meat of the chicken. Mushu Chicken is wonderful.  the sauce is fresh and light. The pancakes are thin and soft.  I like mine with less green onion and more egg.  They are happy to adjust almost anything for you.Hot and sour soup is excellent, full of vegetables and meats... even shrimp.  Lettuce wraps are good, as are crab rangoon, and traditional egg rolls.I have tried most everything here.... the only dishes i won't get again were not for lack of quality, they were just not my taste.  I'm not a big sweet and sour fan, and the raspberry chicken might be more suited to someone who is. It was well prepared, just not my taste
Bacaro=Who would have thought that I'd pick a place in Champaign for my 600th review!... Well, Bacaro certainly deserves it: I finally went there for dinner last night (after wanting to go for several months), and I was wowed. I'm still salivating thinking about it.I went there with pretty high expectations (I'd heard great things about it from several friends and coworkers): that's usually not a good thing as it makes it easier to be disappointed, but Bacaro did not disappoint. In fact, I'm happy to say that my dinner there was on a par with my best dining experiences in NYC.First and foremost: the food. My boyfriend and I decided to share a bunch of dishes. For appetizers, we ordered the fresh mozzarella with heirloom tomatoes and pesto, as well as the roasted suckling pig with homemade sauerkraut: they were both absolutely delicious (don't miss the suckling pig!). We then shared one entree: we got the braised pork shank, which came with sauteed spinach, mushrooms, bacon, and fig sauce: soooo good! The portions are not huge, but two appetizers and one entree turned out to be enough food. For dessert, we got the panna cotta with fresh fruit: simple but just as outstanding. That was some seriously great food!!As Bacaro is also a wine lounge, their wine selection is quite extensive. We got a sampler of three wines by the glass for $14, all of which were pretty good. Not to forget the 10yo port we got with our dessert (very generous pour...), which was good also.Service was great, ambiance was great (although it's a shame that the place was so empty)... it was really a great dinner (sure, it was not cheap, but entirely worth it!). By far the restaurant in Champaign, in my opinion. I'll definitely be back.
The Good Egg - Uptown=They have free wi-fi. Yes! I usually eat here when I don't feel like cooking breakfast at home or before hiking with friends.  I've always had good service here and  I don't know why people are hating the place. Our service has always been pleasant and food is good. I love that they have Stevia sweeteners instead of that dangerous pink aspartame stuff. This place is now called "The Good Egg", so maybe the bad ratings are from the Eggery. They now have Hazelnut coffee which is great and they have stamp cards for frequent guests. My friend Sage has already gotten 4 free breakfasts here 'cause they are so easy to accumulate and the breakfast prices are reasonable. I think people need to give this place another chance. It's no longer called the Eggery, so maybe the rude waitress is gone.
Lombardozzi's Restaurant=No idea how this place is still in business.  Dad and I came in on a Thursday night.  Our waiter was the cook, bartender, and host.  For two hours, this place was deserted except for us.  A touch suspicious.I ordered a gnocchi dinner with lobster and crab in Alfredo sauce ($22.95).  There was a plethora of seafood in this dish, although it was not the best gnocchi I have ever eaten.  The Alfredo sauce was also a bit too garlicy because it lacked any other flavoring.  The entree was not bad, but it wasn't the greatest Italian food either.  The fresh bread was good.  However, I was really unimpressed with the salad.  The dressing was overly strong, and there was far too much of it.  Just an ok meal.In the future, I will definitely go to the Pleasure Bar over Lombardozzi's.  The food is cheaper and the quality of the Italian food is better.
Musashi Japanese Restaurant=I just came back from living in Japan for two years, and Musashi is one of the most authentic Japanese restaurants I've been to. Not only that, but the prices aren't too bad either. I had some kind of vegetarian nabe (like a one pot dish) and beef tongue, my friend had the tonkatsu (fried pork cutlets-- they gave more than one, which was a surprise), and we both had a few Asahi beers and a cheap bottle of sake without completely breaking the bank (maybe about $30 a person with tip and everything).The atmosphere is nothing special. It's a small restaurant in a strip mall, but they do have a couple tables on tatami where you can sit on the floor Japanese style (if that's your thing). Personally, I'd rather have good food than a beautiful restaurant, so I didn't mind at all.All-in-all, I think I'll definitely go back next time I have a craving for ramen or some other Japanese food that's a bit tough to find in Charlotte.The key thing was that the rest of the guests were Japanese, which is always a good sign!I'm a Japanophile myself and I LOVE Musashi. As far as I know, it is the only place to find real authentic Japanese food in the Charlotte area. It has a tatami room where you can sit to eat and feel even more traditional (usually for big parties). To most, the staff doesn't seem so friendly which I think is a standard Japanese way of just staying out of your way. For me it seems they really like it when I come in and converse in Japanese with them. The cook was even nice enough to make me a special order of curry soba - which was great! I try to come back here every two weeks just to be in that authentic Japanese environment. The only setback is that I live so far from it.
Qdoba Mexican Grill=I like coming to this Qdoba because it is close to my house and my office.  Sometimes I will come here on my lunch break or I will come here for dinner with friends on the weekend.  It is a small shop in the Central Park shopping center. My favorite thing to get here is the Craft 2,  you can pick from a variety of things.  For example you can get tacos, tortilla soup, quesadilla or a naked taco salad.  I always get two soft tacos and two hard tacos.  The downside on this Qdoba is that they are closed on Sundays and they are not open very late on Friday and Saturdays.
Luke's of Chicago's=Damn you Luke's! I wanted to flippin' love you. They way I love Tori Spelling movie marathons on Lifetime. They way I love baby's breath in my hair after a bubble bath. And the way I love the smell of gasoline while pumping gas. Really. It's not bad for you...But Luke's, you remain a middle of the road 3 stars. The place was jumpin' around 1:30 recently. I ordered a sausage and peppers to go with cheese and a large side of fries ("more than enough he said for 2 to share). The sausage, while tasty enough, was pretty dry. Then crusty white bread had too many REALLY REALLY mushy parts. Basically half of it fell apart like my Aunt Helen did when I told her I was a mo. The crinkle fries were awesome. Crinkly and crunchy. Though not the enormous portion I anticiapted.  The large fries were $3.75 and the sandwich was $5.50. Service was spot on. Friendly and fast. I'll visit again, though I'll be sure to try a Chicago dog or Bratwurst!Stopped in here yesterday to give a try because fellow Yelper Anthony P swears by the fries and this place is so much closer to me than Port...'s (not long because the Tempe location opens Sept 10).  (I also hate to mention a competitor in my reviews, thus the abbreviation)So went with a very close and dear friend visiting me from out of town.  She wanted a Chicago-style polish sausage and it was dinner time, so what a great opportunity to stop by Luke's.  I love Italian Beef sandwiches, so Luke's was the perfect place to stop in.My friend ordered the polish sausage.  She was so satisfied with it that she wanted to go back the next day and have another.  I put a quick stop to that.   But we'll return before she leaves.  My friend said that the Polish Sausage was better than alot that she'd had in Chicago when she lived there.I had the Jr Italian Beef and whoooooooo wee.  Lemme tell ya.  That thing is amazing and the Jr is HUGE.  I had it for dinner and lunch the next day!  Definitely the best in Phoenix and quite possibly better than most that I have had while I lived in Chicago too.  The bread is quite delicious.  I'm not a big bread eater, but a little dippy-dip-dip of the sandwich in the au jus and I have to sample the bread a little bit.  See, the Italian Beef is on a very dense bread that can hold up to single, double and triple dips in au jus!  Trust me when I say this, if you don't get your Italian Beef dipped, you're missing out on something special!!!!  I also had the giardiarano peppers on my sandwich.  Those were tasty but with little to no heat.  Not the best I've had.  The star of this sandwich is quite frankly... the beef.  Where's the beef?  Oh, Luke's has got it baby.  The beef on that Italian Beef melts in your mouth real real good while exploding with mellow saltiness and HUGE flavor in your mouth.  OH!  Goodness, I could scream that beefy goodness was just delicious!  The best tasting Italian beef I've had in a long long time.  Better tasting that Port..'s.  This place is conveniently located right off the 51 on Indian School.  Very easy to locate.  Look for the sign with the little Chicago Gangster on it and the Pepsi products on the sign (they have 7UP, RC cola, etc).   It is a small place, so I would not say it is good for large groups.  But certainly you can go with a group of 6 or less and should be comfortable, provided they don't have a crowd already there.  The menu has a lot more to choose from, ever heard of a Chicago style hot dog?  Uhm yeah... i've heard Luke's dogs are good too!  They close fairly early, 8pm.So, why the 4 star, well, I docked them for the lack luster peppers and the fries.  My good Yelping buddy Anthony P swears by these fries, but the fries were just *aight* for me.  So, I had to dock them for not providing an all around amazing experience.  BUT still... my friend and I are returning this week.... for round 2.  Trust me... That thick giant beefy sandwich is worth it... and my friend likes the polish sausage too.  TWSS.Always love a good Chicago Dog and Luke's is a cool place to scarf down a couple. This location has been here for a long time and you can tell. The outside is a bit weathered with a very small eating area inside.Been coming here on and off since I moved out here. The menu has the typical Chicago favorites with the service and attitude that make you feel right at home. Giggles! Usually order one of the famous Chi-Dogs or maybe an Italian Beef with both sweet and hot peppers. The french fries here are your typical frozen crinkle cut kind and nothing special. Wish they had handcut. They are so much tastier and can be found in other Chi-town hole in the wall places around town.There are so many new Chicago restaurants in the PHX area now and some of them big chains. Luke's has lost their edge over the years. The quality of the food and the service is not as good as it was in the past and the prices keep going up. Maybe I'm just getting spoiled in my old age.Everyone has a different opinion of this place and the only way to find out is to give them a try. The parking lot is somewhat limited and a bit tricky at times. This place can definitely get really busy during peak eating hours. So get ready for a bunch of impatiant hungry people. ORDER UP!3 STARS
Los Altos Ranch Market=When I want to feel REALLY white, I just roll on down to Ranch Market to confirm my suspicions that, yes, I am in fact not as Hispanic as I think I am.  This store is what Food City WISHES it was!  It takes the best of Mexican specialty stores and eateries and combines it all under one roof.  Shoppers here are mostly Hispanic with a few adventurous gringos thrown in here and there.  But workers there are friendly and know English - some better than others.Holy crap!  I can't believe it's taken me so long to review this place.  I only go here ALL the time for cheap delicious down-home Mexican food, cheap produce, and Spanish rice like Grandma used to make.  I've been going to Ranch Market for about 10 years at their stores in Bakersfield -- where they first started.  I used to make fun of my mom for going to lunch here.  Heh, look who's laughing now.  I'm addicted!The food here is no-frills authentic and seats inside are picnic bench style.  It's not uppity Mexican fare like Barrio Cafe, but it's not Filiberto's diarrhea fare either.  Everything from chile colorado, chile verde, calabasitas, sopes, mole,  tortas, carnitas, chicharrones, tamales, ceviche.  You name it, they have it.   And that's just in the deli.  They have a panaderia with all kinds of cakes, flans and pandulce (sweet bread).  I LOOOVE pandulce.  They even have a jugeria (juice bar) tortilleria, and a counter for fresh cheeses and cremas. And the produce?  Cheap and abundant.  I got some bananas and tomatoes just a little over one dollar.  Don't think about getting any organic veggies here.  This isn't the place.  This is also not the place for low-fat shopping either.  But it is so many other great things that the other stores aren't.Best of all is the atmosphere inside - it is REALLY festive - like you're at Tia and Tio's fiesta.  Mariachis and bands abound here during the weekend.   Dang!!   Fry's, Safeway, Basha's - take note, por favor.  You're on notice.Best place to go when you are feeling blue!As a fresh new transplant to the area who knows absolutely no one besides her beyond retired neighbor who hits the pillow by 4pm, I often find myself slightly lonesome.  Instead of watching another episode of entourage, I decided to see if you yelpers were right....THIS PLACE IS AMAZING!Not only were my new Mexican friends staring at me because I was the only white gal in sight, but probably because I was beaming from ear to ear!  From the outrageous meat section to the beautiful bakery I think I could easily spend a whole day there.  The store was extremely easy to find and for a whopping $1.88 I left with a gigantic cucumber, 2 over-sized oranges and at least 2lbs of grapes!  Great place, cant wait to go again!TRAVEL ALERT/ALERTE DE VIAJE: The State Department wants you to know about new travel restrictions for entering and exiting countries subject to the Western Hemisphere Travel Initiatve, including Mexico. As of June 1, 2009 travelers must possess either a passport, passport card, or WHTI-compliant identification to enter the US by air, land or sea. Contrary to popular belief however, Americans will be able to visit the Phoenix Ranch Market without documentation.GENERAL DESCRIPTION/DESCRIPCION GENERAL: Phoenix Ranch Market III is an upmarket Mexican-style mercado complete with an interior food court called "La Cocina" (The Kitchen). It is located in a rather unpleasant part of town, but manages to attract a large following of gringos eager to inject some diversity into their palette without risking turista.THE FOOD/LA ALIMENTACIN: Offerings in "La Cocina" run the gamut from Mexican style tortas, to more iconic tacos and burritos. Many items offer a choice of meat, from ham to carne asada, to carnitas. A separate area offers various seafood dishes. Everything is ala carte, suprising those hoping to economize using an American style "combo".  Despite this, "La Cocina" remains popular, especially at lunch time.SERVICE/SERVICIO: All orders are taken by an attendant standing next to the line for the cashier. Most guests do not wait long before placing the order. Some have reported difficulty communicating with the attendant however, the other employees tend to have command of the English language. Visitors are responsible for retrieving their own orders and seating themselves at long bench-style tables. PRICES/PRCIOS: Like Mexico itself, the Ranch Market is not the bargain it is made out to be. Prices that may look low for entrees quickly increase when adding in the cost of beverages, churros, and gas. Most respondents however, believe that the mercado occupies an important niche between true fast food and more sophisticated self-serve meals. SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS/CONSIDERACIONES ESPECIAL: Some have accused the Phoenix Ranch Market from being too acommodating to non-Latino customers. While this concern cannot be dismissed, it is obviously the case that all of Mexico has fallen to this trend. New hotels now gleam along the shoreline in Puerto Penasco, golf courses spourt in the arid desert outside Cabo San Lucas, all while Costcos can be found in such tourist-heavy states as Veracruz and Guanajuato. The Calderon Government and America's Hispanics will have to confront the tension between assimilation and authenticity one agua fresca at a time.If Ranch Market is not your thing-- then you are missing out on some really great things.  1.  Chips  (as in chips and salsa)-- they make their own tortilla chips that are only 99cents for a bag.  I brought them to a work party and everyone liked me more than the day before.2. Birthday cakes for kiddies--- wow- talk about a frickin' cool Dora the Explorer cake, or a Spongebob cake-- it put Costco and Aunt Cindy to shame.3.  Meat-- this meat case is LOADED, even if you don't want to buy fresh meat, just go there to look at it. 4.  The affordabiltiy-- C&H Sugar was $1.19 at Ranch Market and $2.99 at any other grocery (non sale priced).  It's like a party in this place, the last time I was there was right before the holidays and I found myself just having a good ol' time grabbing the chips for a work party.  I even stopped by the jewelry counter and contemplated purchasing a 3 inch gold cross, but decided against it.  :o)This place is as exciting as going to Disneyland if you're not used to Hispanic markets! The sights, the smells, the lights, the colors, and the chaos had my head whipping back and forth all evening. We started off with dinner in the cafe inside the market - just $5.99 for 3 street tacos, beans, and rice - and it totally filled me up. I washed it down with a Mexican coke in a glass bottle and it took me back to my childhood to the days before corn syrup became the norm. After eating, we took our time perusing the aisles and examining the foods foreign to us. They have a beautiful produce department and the prices were great on both the more exotic items like fresh papaya's to the staples like tomatoes and lettuce. The meat department is a carnivore's dream come true. Loads of fresh ground beef, pork, and poultry at very fair prices. I had to laugh at the ground pork in the glass case and wish I'd brought my camera. The butcher shaped it into a pig head - complete with a snout - and put cucumber slices for eyes. Not something I'd expect to see at my local gringo Fry's.Shopping here was a real cultural experience tonight and I can't wait to tuck into the treats we brought home!Oh the joy of walking thru Ranch Market... loved the produce section . lower prices , bigger bunches of cilantro , onions and other goodies...pineapples for 2lbs for .99 ? Yes please!  With my buddy Tom as my guide we perused and discussed  all foods  Hispanic.. we talked cremas, with me buying something close to a creme fraiche,  and a arroz conleche that might make stop by there every time I am near..that is some good rice pudding.  We also  looked over their large selections of  dried chiles  for my chili carne I am working on.   My husband  found yummy morsels of ceviche  to his liking and he also tried a  variety of streets tacos.   Loved this adventure in food and look forward to going back ..Hello Ranch Market, nice to finally meet you ! Since moving to my new hood I have fallen in love with this store. They have things I have never seen before anywhere else. I am so overwhelmed when I go here, I am in sensory overload.Mexican bread is 5 for $2, bolillos are 6 for $1, tons of seafood, fresh chorizo ( which I have been eating everyday for a week ), tons of snacks packaged by Ranch Market for super cheap, you can get a meal for 4 people for $10 ( carnitas, rice, beans, tortillas ) and tons of other specialty items. The atmosphere is fun and inviting and everyone is friendly. This store has inspired me to create new dishes at home, like my homemade beans and chorizo. Go here, eat some of their prepared foods that are inexpensive and delicious OR get some fresh ingredients and make something yummy at home.See ya soon Ranch Market.It was a scorcher. Certainly one of our famous triple digit days, and as I sat in the passenger seat, bumming a ride from mi amigo, Vicente, I couldnt shake my contempt for his leather seats. We drove down Roosevelt in the Garfield district towards Ranch Market, on the way discussing the Alwun house, Rito's, and some colourful housing that we both agreed leant to the overall gentrification of the neighborhood. The grounds of this place are sprawling, palatial in fact. I was completely ripped and had on a pair of imitation wayfarers that had a broken arm and kept sliding off my face with the least possible movement of my head.  Endeavoring not to break them further I held my head at rigid attention my back was grammar school like in posture. I then realized how arrogant and white I must've looked, in my mind I fantasized I was a conquistador with a local Toltec guide showing me the ins and outs of the Aztec village we were entering, then I kinda got sick of that phantasy and pictured myself as a balmy Harrison Ford intrepidly following Albert Molina through an alternate ruinous Mayan temple, all the while expecting danger and betrayal at every corner. I probably looked half insane as some of the patrons looked at me oddly, giving me a wide birth. Entering the place it's just as big inside. It's like costco and food city had a wild passionate tequila filled tryst and gave birth to the Eva Longoria of grocery stores. Vicente and I immediately split up, probably not the best of ideas, but I wanted to explore and he was eager to do the same. I quickly snatched up the worst shopping cart in the store (you know the one with a bad front wheel and sticky grip) and let my stomach guide me. Two gallons of horchata. check. Exotic mozzarella style cheese from Oaxaca and  some delicious salty Cotija. check. A lb. of plantains. check. Mango's, apples, dried pinto beans, sugar snap peas, string beans, potato's, roma tomato's- check!  Grocery shopping while intoxicated can get a little quixotic, and confusing to say the least. I hadnt the slightest clue what I was going to make, but the colors of the produce were certainly alluring. Finally Vicente caught up with me and laughed gutturally upon seeing my hodge podge of a shopping cart. I stared thru him with glazed eyes as I espied the "cafeteria". I abandoned my shopping cart and slowly walked over, intriguiged, literally beguiled by the aroma of cooked meats.  I hadnt the slightest clue what most of it was, and what broken Spanish I know certainly wasnt helping with most of the dishes behind the glass, until bingo; Carnitas. There was a word I knew and loved, I stared at the "meat" not quite convinced I knew what I was looking at. Sure it said carnitas, but this was...well...it resembled a tamarind bean, but was much longer, and had a color ruddy and blackish, certainly most unappealing. The tube like meat sat coiled amongst itself like tentacles in a brackish water. I stared at it hypnotized, until a young Mexican attendant came to take my order.  "Hey man what you want?" he asked, breaking the glamour that held me entranced. "...a half a pound of this..." I said unsteadily. He looked at me almost impressed, and half cautiously. As he deflty grasped a pair of tongs and started sloshing the meat back and forth in it's brackish juices, attempting a better grip, it looked more alien to me than ever. I was beginning to come to my senses out of a stupor, and it was slowly dawning on me what this was. In a slightly horrified and hoarse whisper I leaned over the counter and looked him in the eyes and asked, "Wait, wait......what is this...stuff!?" Then he said, grinning a knowing, mocking grin, "Yoo don' know whad tis is and yoo wanna poun' of eet man?"  Just then Vicente strolled up casually behind me and saw what I was doing, the two exchanged a brief chuckle as apparently Vin had overheard the attendant's query. "Trrrriiipa!" Vicente exclaimed, using his dormant mexican accent that usually only comes out when drunk or speaking with his parents, to which the attendant grinned and nodded enthusiatically. Aghast, I stepped back in revulsion, I'd nearly ordered a pound of pigs intestines.I felt profoundly embarassed, never more had I shown off the "pinche gringo" side of my personality than in that moment.  I ended up just ordering some pork ribs that'd been marinated in a chile sauce, along with the ubiquitous spanish rice and refried beans. I love ranch market, but I'm certainly not going back until the raspberry of embarassment lightens.This place is the place to go for when you plan to throw a BIG MEXICAN/LATIN FIESTA!!! Si, si, si!!!!! :) :) They are awesome, It reminds me of Mexico and its Open-aired local markets. Great prices, freshly made corn Tortillas and its also the perfect place to request freshly grounded masa. Thats if you know how to make Tameles from scratch. I have never dined there, but food looks good!!  I LOVE THE AGUAS FRESCAS!!! OH SOO AMAZING Horchata, Fresa, Sandia and Papaya water!!!! :) YUM, YUM!!!Great service, big smiles everywhere and a large variety of products and produce!!I was completely skeptical about Phoenix Ranch Market when my wife said we were going to go check it out last week, so skeptical that I told her I didn't want to go, in all honesty... what could possibly be so good about a little grocery store in a not particularly good part of downtown Phoenix after all? EVERYTHING. Prices lower than Walmart, the largest selection of 89 cent pastries I've ever seen, several small "restaurants", full cows heads for only 49.99, a vast selection of specialty items most grocery stores don't carry much of (Hispanic stuff, fruits, vegetables), plus, it's probably the most clean grocery store I've ever been in. While we don't live close enough to make this our go-to grocery store, I can guarantee you'll see us here several times a month from now on. Five big fat ones for sure.
Miguel's Restaurants=Miguel's has all the things I like:  delicious food, good drinks and candy!The servers are courteous, but tend to work fast and you tend to have multiple people waiting on you, so you don't really get attached to any particular one... One guy brought us the complimentary chips and salsa (which was delicious! The chips were hot and perfectly salted.  The salsa tasted fresh with a really nice kick to it.).  A lady came to take our drink orders and brought them back to take orders and a different guy brought our food out... All of them were nice, but I have no idea what their names are... The margaritas are definitely worth a taste, if that's your thing... The medium is the size of a Presidente from Chili's, for comparision's sake...  So the large is an investment... lol  They have a number of specials for lunch and dinner... My favorite is the beef burrito with rice and beans... It's perfect for a light lunch, but still filling...So, I'ma go ahead and tell you: this place looks sketch as hell, but put that aside... This is one of those things about not judging a book and blah, blah... The inside is clean, the food is super tasty, the specials are great, they sell old school penny candy at the register and the drinks are good... What more do you want?So Miquel's is definitely a perfect definition for a "Hole in the Wall" but let's be honest those places clearly have the best food. As a self proclaimed Mexican fanatic I was excited to see just what this place had to offer. We started with the chips and salsa and they were classic. The chips were warm and crispy and the salsa had just the right amount of kick! My friends and I ordered a little bit of everything...fajitas, shrimp quesadillas, tacos, rice and beans. Everything was delicious...and the portion sizes were perfect! Add to that good service and super reasonable prices! I'm absolutely coming back.
Keegan's Grill=Tired of the loud and over-crowded bars and clubs? Tired of over-hearing the stupidest conversations known to man? Tired of people who give a rat's ass about their waist size and designer shoes? Allow me to introduce you to Keegans. So many spots around the Valley will be crowded, loud, filled with obnoxious people. When you feel like going out but not battling your way in the door or fighting for a table, consider Keegans. Even on a Friday evening, there's plenty of room for you. I can't vouch for their food, though the menu offers some pretty appealing sandwiches, burgers, salads and apps. Best of all, I like the laid back atmosphere of their patio. Sure, it shares itself with a parking lot, basically, that grants you a view of busy Camelback Road or the hustle of Delux. But, while people are zipping in and out of traffic or waiting at least an hour for a seat, you relax without a care in the world. In a way, you're flippin' the finger to all those prissy pansies who think cramming into Delux for dinner is an ideal way to waste a night away. Try the Sundog Amber Wheat. They have this chilled and ready for you. It's a damn fine wheat beer, if you ask me. (Definitely a new fave.)When I'm in the mood to go out but to still be removed from the annoyances of people, I'll return to Keegans. It gets my seal of approval. After all, what a novel concept: I can hear what my companion is saying!I love going anywhere I'm the youngest one in the joint. Okay, not the youngest, but the youngest customer. Keegan's is a great neighborhood restaurant that puts out honest pub grub. No fancy, deconstructed shit here. You want potato skins, you got it! You want saffron dusted potato croquettes with bacon infused butter? Go somewhere else fancy boy!! They have a wide range of items on the menu and their specials are always worth the visit. Meatloaf day is one of the better ones! Just like Mom's. My list of favs1. Beer (I know you can get that anywhere, but I like the bar here, great bartenders)2. Potato Skins (Duh, I talked about them earlier)3. Calihan Cobb (Basically took a couple meats and mixed it in with some greens. Nothing wrong with that)4. Turkey Burger (Better than Delux, need I say more)5. Any of their cobblers On St. Paddy's day they put up a strong corned beef! Just a wee bit of info for ya.
Legends North Shore=So....what do you say when a highly rated place let's you down??  It was okay....When a meal rocks my world, I usually want to lick the bowl clean, yes, like a dog.  I did not, sadly, feel that way about this place.  It IS BYOB but the catch is it's $4 PER glass.  Yep, that's right, not per table my friend.  Keep that in mind.I got the greens and beans on recommendation from many Yelpers on here.  Maybe I just don't have the taste for it, but I thought it was weird, watery and....not good.  I also thought it was going to be green beans and it was kidney beans and spinach that tasted like a warm Caesar salad.  No thanks....I ordered the Penne Vodka, which is my fav meal to order at Italian restaurants.  I also like to add a meatball on if it's homemade.  It was, in fact, confirmed to be homemade so I was all over it!  The meatball itself was delicious.  I love a bread-y meatball.  You know the type.  Soft and packed with flavor.  It was the winner of the night.  The vodka sauce was good, but I wanted way more.  Now I have to preface this by saying I'm a total sauce-aholic.  I love me a good amount of sauce, this didn't even come close.  Then I looked over at Serena R's plate, and her ravioli (which I thought was the same) was SWIMMING in it!  So I stole some of hers....Would I come back?  If someone really wanted to.  But I have a hunch there's way better Italian places to dine at in the Burgh...so now I'm on the hunt!  I gotta connect with my roots, ya' know?
Hartigan's Irish Pub=This bar is not too far from where I work.  I was told by a friend that it was a gay bar, but had pretty decent food.  I walked there one afternoon.  It has a brick exterior and the interior looks like any old Irish pub, nothing overtly gay about it at all (what a change from SF gay bars).The bartender was friendly.  She quickly told us the specials and we had some bottled beer for I think only $1.50 each or something crazy like that.  This isn't' just a happy  hour special either, but I think it's all day.We decided to try the other special that day, 35 cent chicken wings.  We ordered ten and the cook delivered them himself, plenty of napkins, side plates and blue cheese dressing.  Surprisingly, the wings looked great.  What's more they tasted pretty darn delicious.  They were a good size, meaty, slightly crispy here and there and the heat of the sauce was just right.  Can you believe it only cost $3.50 for 10 wings?  They have different daily specials, so check out their website.It was quiet during our late lunch, we were the only ones there, but the place is pretty comfortable (booths, tables, bar, TVs, etc.).It's a hidden find, that's worth checking out.It is somewhat interesting seeing a bar named "Hartigans" - obviously an Irish name, with a menu to match - come up in a category labeled "gay bars".  Not, as Jerry Seinfeld so eloquently put it several years ago, that there is anything wrong with that.When you visit, you will see that the physical bar fits the name of the place, and you should feel immediately welcomed.  The wood stretches the length of the place, from the entrance almost to the end of the upper floor.  And yes, there is a lower floor, which is perhaps where the other aspect comes into play.Head downstairs and you get more of a club atmosphere, with pool tables, space for dancing and yes, cages.  Or cage.As you might expect, an Irish Gay Bar does have a menu, and it is interesting, sporting items such as the Dirty Gertie, the Monte Christa and the Toora Loora Loora.  At the suggestion of the bartender, I went with the Monte Christa - hot ham, turkey and swiss cheese with light raspberry vinaigrette on grilled texas toast - and you know what?  It was fab-u-lous.  Or I was.The place is definitely a bit of a paradox, if you have not figured that out already, but we could use more of that around these parts.
Juan's Authentic Mexican Food=Just Not For MeThe staff at Juan's Authentic Mexican Food is warm, friendly, and extremely accommodating, which is why I feel terrible for calling out their Mexican food as bland. I really wanted to like Juan's so badly, especially after reading so many positive reviews. However, the food in my opinion just isn't good.This was my second visit to Juan's Authentic Mexican Food Restaurant, and for me the food is just so-so. Just one step above what you would be served in a fast food establishment.I enjoy starting my meal with chips and salsa just like everyobe else.  The salsa at Juans is like a watery tomato puree posing as salsa and the chips tasted stale. For my entrée I choose the Beef Flatas and Mexican rice, both of which had very little taste.  The meal was just very disappointing and took over 30 minutes to serve.Juan's isn't the worst but I'm not in a rush to visit again
Shogun=If you're a picky sushi eater, don't waste your time here... it may be cheap, but the service and quality reflect that.Somehow, I managed to spend about $25 on my dinner there tonight, even with happy hour pricing.  I know, it's not so bad for sushi... but the service was extremely off, and the sushi was just meh.I'd been before and I'm sure I'll go again, just with the expectations in check next time.I shared an order of yellowtail sashimi, an I also had a seaweed salad (it was violet in color - have you ever seen that before?), a scallop handroll (generous in serving size but way too creamy for my liking), and an order of ikura.  We sat in the bar area... it was fine for a casual dinner with friends, but nothing fancy at all.  There are much better sushi places to choose from - even in AZ!The absence of flaw in beauty is itself a flaw.I was in Phoenix for 17 hours a couple of days ago.  It was a perfectly warm day outside, one of those beautiful early fall days in the desert when the sun bathes everything in clear, comforting sunlight.  It felt great just walking around Kierland Commons in the warm, late afternoon sunshine. My friend chose her favorite sushi restaurant in Phoenix, Shogun, for dinner.  We got there fairly early and sat at the sushi bar.  Looking around, I noticed that I was the only Buddhahead in the restaurant (and I'm only half-Asian).  "This can't be a good sign", I thought.  Don't' get me wrong:  I don't believe that a restaurant operator's ethnicity must match the culinary heritage of the food he serves.  This can't be right.  Food, like human compassion and friendship, transcends race and ethnicity.  My friend ordered most of the items off the menu.  We started with a Sunshine Roll, which was heaping mounds of spicy tuna loaded onto a modified California Roll.  The sauce for the spicy tuna was heavily mayonnaise based, which was a bit odd.  It was different, but tasty and original.The Wahoo Sashimi in ponzu sauce with sliced cucumbers was light and delicate.  Wahoo is ono in Hawaii and is a white fish that is mild and slightly sweet.  It went well with the citrus ponzu.  The Veggie Roll was odd in that the ingredients didn't blend together at all.  It consisted of cooked asparagus, some kind of weird takuan (pickled daikon radish) that was a bit bitter, kimpira gobou (burdock root), and shisou (mint leaf).  All the wasabi and gari in the world couldn't fix this roll. We also had Shake Sushi (Salmon Sushi), Octopus Salad, and some edamame.The sushi here was so far off the beaten path that the tastes were a bit off, they were almost uncomfortable to my palate.  But, it's good to try different styles of food in different settings.Food doesn't have to be perfect, or authentic, to be enjoyable.
Mi Pueblo Mexican Food=Chile Relleno plate was pretty good here the beans were good the rice was meh. The chips and 2 diff salsa's were good tasted fresh. It didnt take long and Horchata was good! All in all I will stop here again and try some other dishes since its really close to my new pad!Mi Pueblo is a small place tucked into a strip mall off of 7th St and Union Hills. It has been there for at least 6 years that I know of. I wanted something Mexican ish for lunch today and needed to try a new place. I was greeted by a nice girl and looked around a bit. They have 30 combo lunches/dinners pictured on the wall. I did not see any other type of menu. I asked about the Green Chili and she said it was good. They offer a chip bar with 2 types of salsa and the carrots in hot stuff. LOL The salsa was a fresh tasting red salsa and a roasted chili green type both were good and complimented the chips perfectly. The burrito was a generous size and was covered in green sauce and cheese with sour cream on the side. The in-nerds were flavorful and plentiful, the pork was tender and nice sized chunks. (I did have one fat hunk) The beans were good and the rice was OK. It tasted like a nutty taste some how. ?? right around $7 and I could not eat it all.Decided to come by and check out this local mom and pop restaurant. It is close to my house and on the way to pickup my granddaughter. She is so much fun.Located in the same complex as Good Will and right next to a popular donut chain. This little restaurant serves up a good variety of the more popular Mexican dishes.Inside is very small with several tables and chairs to enjoy your meal. The menu has a good selection of photos so that you can just point at what you want to eat. They even have a nice complimentary chip and salsa bar to get you started.Ordered the Green Chili Pork Burrito Combo plate and helped myself to both the mild and hot salsas. The burrito tasted OK and seemed to be filled mainly with beans and green chili gravy. The cubed pork seemed to be hiding and required a bit of searching to find the rather small pieces. This place more or less cranks out some very typical Tex-Mex style food with not a whole lot of flavor. Even the salsas were pretty bland and I had to add a large amount of hot sauce to kick things up a notch.Service was friendly and the place was pretty busy. I would not call this authentic Mexican food unless you are just used to the Americanized versions of this cuisine. The prices are reasonable and the food in general falls into my  A-OK category.Give them a try and see what you think. Everyone has a different opinion of what they enjoy when it comes to Mexican food. LEFT STILL HUNGRY!3 STARSNot Bad.....Not Bad At AllI was expecting Mi Pueblo Mexican Food to be the typical Mexican fast food. Boy was I wrong.  Mi Pueblo is a step above the rest.Lets start with the complimentary hot chips and salsa. Many Mex style recipes give you those cheap paper thin tasteless chips but not Mi Pueblo. These chips are lighy, crispy, and flavorful and  salsas are really tasty.On this visit I ordered the grilled chicken taco plate and I  not  disappointed. The chicken was moist, seasoned, and loaded with flavor. The chicken tacos came with a homemade "dressing" not sure what it was. All I know it was really good.Even though I was completely full from.my meal I couldn't leave without trying dessert.  So I decided to try the  sopapillas which come drizzled with honey and powdered sugar and a scoop of vanilla ice cream on the side, it was delicious.Good food, inexpensive meals, and great customer.  I will be back.
Waffle House=This is actually the first time I have ever been to a Waffle House. My husband's cousin talks about going here all the time, so I had to check it out.Our server was friendly and she even was able to incorporate the phrase " sausage fest " into our brief conversations. In other instances this would have annoyed me because of how inappropriate it was in this setting, but while staring at her huge pregnant belly, I could do nothing but laugh.The food was not good. The sausage gravy was way too salty, eggs were way under-cooked, waffles were average, coffee was alright ( served in a lipstick stained mug the first go around ), sausage and bacon were below average, hash browns were limp, mushy, and flavorless.I would only return to a Waffle House if this was my ONLY option.
Phoenix Blue Fin=Sounds of stirring, lunchnears and my appetite waitsmy neighbor enters.Quick we drive to itA simple place but look-busy!Still no wait to sit.Varied menu greets usI choose the daily specialFood like its home-made.Service is friendly.Order comes quickly to you,Owners always smile.Soon it's time to gomy thoughts turn food away, but lookmy wallet not empty.Hands down the best teryaki in the world. i'm really not exagerating. this place is awesome. i have been going to blue fin off an on for the past 20 years. i remember as a child going to florance crittenden after getting a teriyaki bowl with half a salad. every chance i get i drop by this place. the teriyaki bowls are serious. not skimping on portions at all. and if you seriously off a diet, they have double meat portions. :D    i like the dark meat chicken version. drop on a heavy sprinkling of the hot powder and some black sesame seeds. OMG!!! the best in the world.  the Panko chicken is my second favorite dish. the egg rolls are great. the owners are always great, cheerful and ready to chat you up. i was so glad to hear this place was spared the wreaking ball. i would have chained myself to the door if it came to it. inside is cute and hasn't changed..in forever. i am serious. ever.getting to it is tricky now. and parking is just as tricky. but its worth it. SOOOO WORTH ITYay for me, they open at 10:30am.  Service quick and helpful. Owner (I think) was present and seemed to know quite a few of the regulars. I had the panko chicken with an egg roll. Both were simple, yet above average. Quite a selection for such a small place.  All of the items I saw were pretty big or almost too big for a single serving.  Prices are a buck or two more than you might pay for at your average rice bowl shop, but it's worth it.I'll be back. Soon.This is one of the restaurants that is close to my hotel. I came here for a quick snack. I ordered the Teriyaki Chicken Katsu lunch Bowl. For $5.50+ tax, I get two pieces of Chicken Katsu drenched in Teriyaki Sauce. Unfortunately, I find the chicken pieces not too fresh and unbearable to eat. Though a nice size snack for me, but I find the bowl very unsatisfying. My rice bowl: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/oMBNvB6tHlwW3UwGBYqljw?select=63adwMUXsZA0hS2VsQJaqwWith locals enjoying this restaurant and the high-rating, the restaurant has the Yelp Sticker posted on the diner's door. I'm not too sure if this place deserves the famous red-sticker!Maybe I'm spoiled, because I live in San Francisco/Bay Area and get better rice bowls from places like Kaz Teriyaki and Suruki Supermarket (both located in Downtown San Mateo). This is probably one of the better places Phoenix has to offer.This is a wonderful establishment, and easily the best Japanese fast food restaurant in our city.My review isn't even necessary, as I think the Blue Fin can speak for itself, 99% of the people that come here will leave satisfied.I've found that small dedicated local busineses like this usually engender nothing but respect and praise from their community; but every once in a while you'll get a certain someone who for whatever reason is going to go on the record publicly and trash a place that is beloved by the majority.I wasnt even going to write this review until I saw the egregious 1 star rant that this type of person wrote previously. So, rather than a review proper, this is more of a review coupled with a response to that baffling 1 star atrocity below. If your the type of person who will shell out 1 and 2 star reviews to mom and pops earnestly trying to serve their community and build a sustainable business, but give 5 star reviews to places like el pollo loco and ross; than please dont come here. you'd be better off in your $15 elastic waste band pants eating greasy chicken in your honda pilot.post script:SEA WEED SALAD IS KING HERE!Cute little place with great teriyaki!!Business owner is a very nice older lady, she cheerfully walks around the tables to check if everything is well.   The Service is outstanding, teriyaki was delicious with rice and veggies. Also if you get a large drink, you get unlimited refills! Yay for raspberry tea!! Great small business with good food and great service. Its a must visit if  you're around the area!! :)I was planning to go to a party but it was cancelled and since I didn't have much to do on that day, I decided to try a taste of Japanese cuisine this time.Took me awhile to find a good restaurant and later chose this one. Place is nice and has feel good vibes in it. Great for some fine food to eat. I ordered a California roll, shrimp tempura and a seaweed salad. The salad was indeed fresh and tasty but it was in small portions. The shrimp tempura was good and as for the rolls, they were delicious! It was indeed worth it every penny spent here. Might come back here and try out the other dishes they have on their menu.ok, what is wrong with me? I want to love this place like everyone else does but when it comes to the food I can't quite get behind it. I want to love their slightly smokey tasting chicken teriyaki but I can't help but feel that it is more than a little dry. I want to get behind their oyako bowl but I am just not super fond of the onion crowded omelette. If I were rating it just on service and sweetness of staff it would get 5 stars in my book though!
A-Ri-Rang=I used to come to this place before I found out about other Korean places around campus. Each place has their own specialties. I love getting the bibimbap and bulgogi from here. In my opinion, the soon du bu doesn't have much flavor. I started coming less and less because the owner at this place isn't too friendly. Also, once I came to get food and saw them refilling the water dispenser with a tub that didn't look so sanitary...made me lose my appetite.
Mama Ricotta's=What a nice treat! The bread, to start, was fresh and seasoned with Italian herbs, and served with olive oil & red pepper flakes, yummy! The shrimp and crab risotto was delicious, creamy & buttery, a true risotto. We also ordered the Pollo Alla Griglia, a seasoned grilled chicken, served with mashed potatoes & the vegetable of the day, which I substituted for the grilled asparagus, delish! The service was great and the wine selection perfect! An enjoyable evening in the patio, and somewhere we will return!
Fazoli's=Mama Mia! Fast food Italian. Who woulda thunk it? Well. Somebody incompetent and passionless. I would rename this place Yuckoli's. Fits better. I knew I was treading on dicey turf going to this joint. But it was in Rickie's old hood and the culinary establishments were limited to fast food and chain restaurants. So I went basic with spaghetti and meatballs (oh God, really, for the love of balls, these circular beef objects were filled with some sawdust like material and blander than Jennifer Aniston's movie career). Not good. We also tried a chicken Alfredo like dish that apparently was made with Elmer's glue. Pasty. Bland. And, yes, it does stick to construction paper. I wasn't expecting much. But I wasn't expecting to be grossed out. All I can say is "Mama Mia, papsa a pee'ah, daddy's got the diarrhea". There. That's classy. And Elite of me. Don't ya think?
Cuisine Malaya=They get an automatic bump to 4 stars for brazenly being the only malaysian joint in town. Despite being all over the map (sushi, chinese, malaysian, thai, japanese) Cuisine Malaya does really well (as in, authentic) with some stuff, pretty well with the rest. Decent prices + me being able to sit down and have decently executed cuisine from 4 different asiatic countries for dinner = awesome.The lunch menu is limited but still very veg friendly. Dinner is where its at. I love malaysian curry (well, curry of any kind, really) and the Curry Vegetable Chef's special hits the spot. Okra and eggplant, tomato, tofu, green beans, yes yes. Oily, smokey curry and delicious coconut milk, yumm. Unless you're ravenous, the 11$ will be well spent, as you'll have lunch for the next day. And we all know curries improve overnight ;) They have both Thom Kha and Hot n Sour veg options, both soups I adore. Tofu can be added/subbed to almost anything here.All the sushi I've had has been perfectly prepared, with good ingredients. The rolls aren't 80% rice, 20% stuff. They're also flexible about ingredients, something a lot of places are not (have them make you a vegetable tempura roll - delicious).I wish they had coconut rice, and gado gado. I don't get the "shrimp sauce" served with the hibachi items (a mixture of what tasted like mayo and ketchup, yikes). For my malaysian curry fix, however... I'm stoked they're here.Curry Laksa: Can we say delish? Even I, the Asian guy needs a break from the run of the mill Chinese, Japanese or Thai food. That's where Cuisine Malaya comes in. Malaysia contains a plethora of Asian ethnicities, and each culture's influence can be readily seen in the food. It goes a little something like this: Chinese food has Indian influences, Thai food has Muslim influences, Indian food has Chinese influences and somewhere in that hodgepodge is a little Indonesian and something like that. To the novice, this might seem like just another Asian food joint. To the veteran eater, it's so much more. Now the food might look similar, but I can assure you, it tastes completely different. That's what Malaya is. Many of the dishes looked so familiar to me it made me nostalgic. Once I had a taste though, I had a "WTF" moment, but in a good way.
Cheuvront=Meh.Can't believe I'm going to say this... but...So, forget Cheuvront. Just go to Kazmirez.Atleast at Kaz, you get ample variety when you order the fruit/cheese tray. At Cheuvront, you get a minute amount of cheese (only two types) with hardly any fruit or nuts. Forget it. Not worth it. Not after having Kazmirez fruit/cheese tray. Nothing else can compare. I tried a Viogner by the glass, and it was the worst Viogner I've ever had. Also good to know: their bottle service is pricey. You can guy a $17 bottle of wine there and take it to go (good deal) or pay $35 for the same bottle to drink it at the restaurant. Uhmm... wow. I feel for my date. He bought a glass of wine, 1 bottle of wine and 1 small cheese/fruit tray and it come to around $100. That, my friends, is the definition of absurdity.Oh dear god, I'm in love...Peppered Filet and Martini Scallop dreams fill my mind. Blue Cheese stuffed olives in my martini?? what?? shut the fuck UP!! Sooooo amazing. Quality all the way. I had a glass of Byron Pinot Noir (fabulous) then a white chocolate martini for desert. (I prefer to drink my desert). Great romantic spot to bring a date. Secures that you will be getting action later, trust me. If you see me at Cheuvront stop by and say hello. I'll be the one in the corner making sweet love to the macaroni and cheese..... no joke.This is where Marie Antoinette would eat, were she a contemporary Phoenician and not a deposed French ruler from the eighteen century. Total decadence. Total indulgence. Totally wrong but oh-so-right. Brunch: cheese plate, eggs Benedict in a spicy hollandaise, Gruet mimosa. Lunch: cheese plate, burger with dry jack cheese and pancetta on ciabatta, sweet potato fries, gin-cucumber martini.Oh my god, the cheese list. I really hope I never become lactose intolerant. Because I don't think it would stop me from devouring cheese plates like they're going out of style, but it would make the aftermath upsetting. Anyway, their list is robust and I've yet to try something I don't like. The Roaring '40s blue is excellent. Idiazabal was like a Spanish manchego, but smokier. The manchego was hard and nutty and delicious. The Chimay Grand Cru made great use of its Belgian beer namesake and was smooth and a bit soft.Would you think I was weird if I said the Hoch Ybrig tasted like a Swiss mountain meadow? Whatever, it totally did - floral and fresh and pastoral. I bet those cows were eating some sweet clover and spring blossoms. Wine, cheese, bread. It's like a guaranteed homerun in my book. One problem - some of the sloooowest food ever. And not in that this-was-grown-within-a-four-block-radius way, either. Just slow. Like fucking molasses. Order-in to food-received: 55 minutes. For three burgers, a macaroni and cheese and a cold turkey sandwich. During a late lunch amongst not more than five other tables. This only makes sense if the kitchen contains a bong. Or maybe a live pig. Don't think about it, though. Just order another cocktail, consume your weight in cheese and, if you want to reenact my own experience, drool a little. As Marie Antoinette would say (OK, probably not, since this is totally unverified and historically questionable, but fuck you for saying so), "Let them each cheese!"Horribly sweaty girl is hungry after Critical Mass.  Cheese on the mind.  Critical Mass ended by going down Central and I had never been to Cheuvront before.  Luckily, I was with Ayesha and it took nothing to convince her to go there.  There were 7 of us and they were extremely quick in pushing table together for us.  They didn't even mind our sweat and water bottles.  The server even filled Ayesha's for her.  I took one look at the menu and my eyes stopped at the bottom: macaroni and cheese.  I rarely eat it, but as soon as I saw it, I wanted.  Badly.  Ayesha said she liked the bleu cheese.  SOLD!  I effing love bleu cheese.  For $8, I think it was a good value.  It was a good portion, but not too much.  Rich and creamy with gargantuan hunks of genuine bleu cheese, that had started to melt.  It was incredibly filling for the size!Downfall: Unisex bathrooms.  What the hell!  I don't care how nice a place is, guys still piss all over the place.The mac and cheese is $5 during the week during happy hour.  I will be back for it, most definitely!Huge points for the server who took Amy in stride when I told him I'd spank his ass for something.  (I don't remember, as it was 109 degrees and I had been on my bike for over 2 hours.)I really want to love Cheuvront. It's close to work and I like the atmosphere here. I also really like the choice of wines they offer and they always have great wine tasting events going on.  I just get the vibe that everyone takes themself WAY too seriously. It's nothing that is blatant because the service is efficient and friendly enough but it's just a feeling that I get, perhaps a slight upturning of the nose or that, the customer should be thankful that they get to be here.I'm always preoccupied with attitude so maybe it's just me but I always have that "am I welcome here?" kind of feeling when I come here. Of course if I'm spending $$ here than the answer is obviously yes....still.....have to have more of a think on this.By all means worth checking out, you'll probably feel a different vibe than me.
Triangle Bar & Grill=As I do whenever I review a sub shop, I must state that I'm from DE, and have high standards for subs.  After trying a battleship sub this weekend, I can say without reservation that the subs here are the best in PGH, without a doubt.  If you haven't tried one, you need to ASAP!Given that I've been wanting to try a battleship for a long while, a friend and I decided to pick one up and have a picnic in nearby Frick Park.  We called in our order, and they gave us an estimate of about 45 min., which worked well given that we had other errands to run.  By the time we arrived at Triangle, our battleship was ready, so we were able to cut in line, pay ($14.75), and be off to have our picnic.Unwrapping the sub, it was immediately apparent that it encompassed 26" of goodness.  Since it wasn't pre-cut, I tore it in half crosswise, which gave each of us 14" to chow down on. The sub was generously filled with meats and cheeses, with a sufficient but not overwhelming amount of vegetables.  The bread was substantial and of good quality, and didn't tear or crumble as we ate our portions of the sub, as lesser quality bread does.  I ate half of my portion, and my friend was unable to finish his, despite intending to do so.  I ate the other half for lunch the next day, and it was almost just as good as it was upon receipt.Both my friend and I were very impressed with the quality of the battleship, and it kept us full for a subsequent long-ish walk in the park.  I'd highly recommend it as an ideal picnic item.  Whether you live near Swissvale or not, be sure to try a battleship, since it's without a doubt the best sub in PGH!
Majerle's Sports Grill=$8 for a well vodka/tonic at Majerle's? Are you serious? I haven't paid that much for a well drink except for fancy resorts and pricey bars in LA or NYC.  That drink and a tall Blue Moon last night came out to a ludicrous $16 before tip. Perhaps this is special highway robbery pricing for unsuspecting NBA All Star visitors?!TVs are awkwardly placed, but the exposed brick lends a time-worn atmosphere to this cozy sports bar.  $16 just isn't worth it though. Too many other bars in the vicinity to waste your time.So I know Abu J. has given me the advice to stop going out with losers, and I have yet to take him up on his advice, but after my latest outing I think I will have to.  I was hanging out at home when I got the call to hang out with this guy for a low key night.  I had to remind him it was Monday Night Football and the NLDS game of Phillies v. Rockies.  So he suggests we hit up Majerle's, which I'm down for because it means more sport watching and less talking.So I find my way down here, and say screw it to paying for parking.  After the whole $20 to park at Westgate, I'm down to take my chances at getting a parking ticket.  It's ridiculous how much the city makes off of parking, parking tickets, and the ever illustrious DUIs.Anyways, I go into Majerle's, completely ignored by the hostess out front.  Glad to know she's getting paid $8.50 to not talk to anyone and act pretty...  Settle down at the bar and order a Blue Moon, because it's a Monday, it's football, it's baseball, and I'm preparing for another laborious date.Halfway through my beer my date arrives.  Which wouldn't be cool, but I need to get good and drunk so I deal.  He automatically decides we need to get wings.  Thanks for deciding...because I have no thoughts of my own.  Apparently him being a gentleman meant he would talk shit on the wings I wanted, then reluctantly give in to getting the boneless buffalo wings.  Which are $5 along with four other appetizers during their 4-8 pm happy hour.  Good deal there!The wings come out within 15 minutes or so and they look...odd.  It looks like someone sliced tofu and lightly fried them, then dipped them in excessive amounts of sauce.  Definitely not the most appetizing item to look at.  I wished they looked better, because then I wouldn't have the hippie making fun of me the whole time.  They tasted okay, but the look alone was too much of a turn off to enjoy.The bartender disappeared after we ordered the wings, so we spent some time waiting for her to discover us again so we could order our entree.  Oh how I wished she had taken our order earlier.  I had to listen to the douche hippie talk smack on the Angels and how people die all the time so Adenhart's death didn't matter.  Yeah...that deserved a total smack in the face.  Or complete beat down.  Don't ever hate of my Angels or commit blasphemy against Adenhart.  I will not stand for that, especially if I've had a few drinks in me.Anyways, so I eventually order the veggie wrap with chicken and he gets the chicken parmesan.  Not too much time passes, so I could enjoy the flat screens and watch the Dolphins show Mark Sanchez how to play a real football game.  The wrap comes, and it's huge!  I enjoyed the fruit salad of pineapple and grapes.  And the actually spinach tortilla and veggies were good, but the chicken just dragged the wrap down.  It was so bland and tasteless.  I wish I would have just gone pure veggie.I had a couple rounds of beer after that, just to pass the time until the Dolphins could be declared the official winners.  Conversation came and went with the people at the bar, far more interesting than the person I was with.  The beers came and went, and soon it was time to peace out.  When I saw the tab, I was glad I didn't have to pay.  $60+ to "enjoy" conversation with a tool and overpriced food and drinks.  Sometimes it's good to be a girl...We stopped in for a bit to eat and some sports watching the other night. My boyfriend had never been before and we are close to down town so it seemed a great idea. Pleased we were! First we got a bomb parking spot right out the front door and it wasn't too crowded so we got a nice table and served quickly. They have happyhour until 7pm, which I love! Most place stop at 6, which sucks since most people cant make it anywhere without driving light speed before 6pm after work. So 7pm cut off for HH is a great find! Pass it on!We ordered the boneless wings to start with half medium sauce and half of their special TD sauce, I recommend both! TD sauce is similar to Zipps Golden sauce if you know what that is like, but better. Then I got the chicken tacos, very good. Enjoyed them greatly! Exactly what I was looking for, hit the spot! Jon got some kinda spicy pasta, which when it hit the table looked amazing, however big prob, they put mushrooms in it, this isn't listed on the menu and Jon is allergic. They took care of it quickly though, remade his selection sans mushrooms and we found out it was as good as it looked. Very nice staff, clean inside, fast service, lots of TVs.... and great happyhour specials!
Nitaya Thai Restaurant=Nitaya, how do you survive?  When I come by, you're so empty inside that I can always hear the wok frying behind the walls.  At school, the kids pick their teams, and no one ever picks you as their favorite.Honestly, given the competitiveness of Thai restaurants in town and the steep rental prices for property in downtown Champaign, how does Nitaya make it?  The food is not offensively bad, just forgettable.  I've sampled their curries and noodle dishes but nothing invokes the vividly bright, colorful senses that I associate with Thai cooking.  My entrees there are often limp and sad (but maybe I can blame that on the lighting...?).If you want to go on a serious date for Thai food, Nitaya Thai could serve as an appropriate setting.  The interior decor is immediately recognizable as an oh-so-camp, tropical-themed '80s bar, with wicker chairs and faded turquoise booths.  There's something undeniably charming about the setup, but unfortunately it lacks the warmth that only a crowded dining room can offer.
Matador Restaurant=I wanted sushi and was willing to drive my friends to PV for Yasu Sushi Bistro (highly recommended by me!) but they were too tired and wanted something within a block or two of the Hyatt. They asked the concierge, who recommended this place as very good! Has she ever had good Mexican food, or is she getting kickbacks?The Matador Restaurant is across from the Hyatt Hotel, in the center of downtown. It has been in business since 1976, is large, and IMO, "Bleh".It is owned by a Greek Family for one. All 32 years. All the Mexican dishes and specialites were mostly from one of their first cooks. Great, make your cook create all the recipes for authentic dishes and you make all the money. There is even a small Greek section of the menu which offers low end Greek dishes (Gyros Sandwich, Gyros Plate, Greek salad, Feta Cheese plate, and something called Shrimp a-la Mike!)The menu has print so small, only a search light and magnifying glass can decipher it. They do have some authentic dishes, like menudo, carnitas, lengua con chile verde; and the basics like enchiladas, tacos, tamales, tostadas, chimichangas, carne asada, chalupas, fajitas and flautas. They bring you chips and two types of salsa. We ordered (extra) guacamole, and it didn't taste or look very fresh, like they mixed a jar of paste with a couple of avacadoes. The Margaritas were uninspired and weak. I tried the Machacas (sauteed shredded beef) which was moist but lacked flavor, and was supposed to be with green chilis, tomatos, and onions with rice and beans for $10.95). 3 others in my group were unimpressed with the food, and they were French Canadien (So what do they know about Mexican food, except when it isn't good!).They also have steaks and chicken dishes, but why bother? The food was passable but would not entice you to come again, unless you got drunk at a ball game at the local Chase Field stadium and were starving.OMG NOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!like Grand Master Flash said about the white lines "Don't Do It"Rang dang diggedy dang di-dang Diggedy dang di-dang diggedy dang di-dangmy Torta Burro had no flava-dang, i was sad panda mangthis business has been in operation too long and clearly the owners (i doubt the original owners) stopped giving a shit. if they did the average rating wouldn't be 2.5 stars. i remember this place as a kid, i don't remember ever eating here. so i really cannot comment on how great it was. but like Sing High, the downtown nostalgia restaurants are extremely scary. just avoid this...it's not good. my plate looked sad, just a naked burro with a side of hashbrowns that were hardly crispy anywhere. the salsa was tasty, but i would hardly add a star to it. the service was compitant, but i couldn't understand her. i couldn't blame my ADD on it. my friend liked the menudo, but i wouldn't make that a saving grace for this place. cool logo on the building. very retro..but do not be fooled by it.
El Rinconcito Mexican Food=Though this place truly looks like a dive, I had high expectations - for the food, at least - because of a glowing review I read in one of the local journals. The place looks a tad decrepit and while the tables look clean, their surfaces did have a bit of a sticky feel to them. On one occasion I had the huaracha recommended by the review I read. It was a generous portion of food and it tasted good, though it was a bit on the dry side. On a second visit, this time with my friend Rand R., I ordered a variety of street tacos - al pastor, carne asada, carnitas, and chorizo. They were very good, especially when you add the salsa offered on the side. The horchata I ordered with the tacos was good and was the perfect  accompaniment fo the tacos. In all, my dining experiences here were A-OK, though I'd rather go to Tacos Atoyac for similarly-priced  but higher-quality food ... and tables with a cleaner feel.
Capriotti's Sandwich Shop=.                                               sandwiches and                      Capriotti's steak                             I  am          one  of                                                                still fullI had                                                                                       4 hours later.I guess           it's a                                                                               medium.                   good thing                                                   not the                                     that I ordered                sandwich                                                        the smallFilling and delicious but not for the faint of heart.  Urp.  Mmm, sweet peppers.When you decide to become a vegetarian, you realize that there are some sacrifices you are going to have to make in the food department. When I became veg, veggie burgers were made by mixing this powder with water and frying it in a pan. It was horrible. I pretty much ate grilled cheese for the first year. Now, fifteen years later, Capriotti's...  Holy Shit!!! VEGGIE TURKEY SUB. Tears of joy are streaming down my face at THIS very moment. It's like losing your virginity all over again, but this time its good! Real good!For $7.75 I have the hugest, most delicious sub I have ever eaten in my life. Such good quality ingredients, and this medium is HUGE!They also have New York Kettle Style Chips, which are delish, but you definitely don't need them when you have 12" of veggie turkey sub staring you down.My life seriously just changed.An indulgent deli, and I mean that in the best of ways.  Subway healthy this is not- and that is ok.  I come here if I want a good old fashioned splurge type of deli sandwich.  I ordered the 20 inch (!) Capastrami. Lots of salt on the pastrami,  full on mayo based  cole slaw, and no wheat rolls here.  Hits the spot.  Staff friendly, sandwich made in less than five minutes.
Baja Fresh Mexican Grill=OMFG!!!!!!!!!!!  I went here for lunch today and they had lobster tail tacos.  I come to this location about once a month.  It's incredibly clean and the service is always friendly.  I like to see confusion on peoples' faces when I break out my Spanish and place my order.  The lobster tail tacos were A M A Z I N G!!!!!!!!!  Big hunks of lobster tail (langostino) and a pinkish sauce served in huge corn tortillas.  I got the combo, which comes with a side of rice and a side of beans.  You can choose refried or black.  I love their black beans.Another thing I love about Baja Fresh is their salsa bar.  My favorite is the baja.  It's a smoky chipotle salsa.  I always get a bunch of different salsas to take home with me.  Their green salsa changed, but it's still really good and tastes so fresh.There are NO microwaves here.  I have a "thing" about microwaves and rarely use mine at home.  I think it's strange to heat up food without something...hot.  *shudder*Anyway, it's a clean facility with fresh food and many different options.  I'm still thinking about my langostino tacos, even if this is a chain.Baja fresh is pretty freakin fresh.I love their "no freezer, no MSG, no preservatives, no nuthin crappy" vibe, which they reinforce with signage plastered around the restaurant.The food is delish. Lots of good options for meat-eaters & veggie-heads. They do it right with a delicious salsa bar that containis at least 5 different salsas, fresh limes and they've got a good selection of iced teas.
