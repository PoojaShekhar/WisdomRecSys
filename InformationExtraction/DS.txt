Dont expect to have a HUGE selection of alcohol. \n\nTheir wings are good as are their salads. If you are gluten free this is not your place...lots of fried food and sandwiches. \nOffers a quick lunch.", "type": "review", "business_id": "KayYbHCt-RkbGcPdGOThNg"}

I will no doubt be visiting again.  The service and prices were great.. and the restrooms were clean.   I had the buffalo chicken sandwich and it was delicious.  The menu consists of typical bar food food, however; theres a few different items on there which stand out on the menu..\n\nA cool bar off the beaten path that is a worth a trip.  \n\nCheers ! !", "type": "review", "business_id": "KayYbHCt-RkbGcPdGOThNg"}
